Make a Dualgamed-O2jam
Where I have two screens with five keys on each.
Make initial keybindings "a s d f v" and "n j k l ;"
Make a music generator that keeps making new rhythms and melodies then have each note that falls play different parts to it.
Also include hold keys and strike keys.
 Play the sound as a note is struck or held correctly.

 I'll create a dual-screen O2Jam-style rhythm game with procedural music generation. This will feature two 5-key play areas, hold notes, and dynamic music that plays as you hit the notes correctly.

I've created a dual-screen O2Jam-style rhythm game with all the features you requested:

## Key Features:

### ðŸŽ® Dual Screen Gameplay
- **Left screen**: Keys A, S, D, F, V
- **Right screen**: Keys N, J, K, L, ;
- Each screen operates independently with its own score and combo counter

### ðŸŽµ Procedural Music Generation
- Dynamically generates rhythms and melodies using musical scales (major, minor, pentatonic, blues)
- Each lane corresponds to different notes in the scale
- Left and right screens play in different octaves
- BPM changes dynamically between 100-180
- Scale changes occasionally for variety

### ðŸŽ¯ Note Types
- **Strike notes**: Regular notes that require a single key press
- **Hold notes**: Blue notes that must be held down for their duration
- Visual feedback shows which keys are being held

### ðŸ”Š Dynamic Audio
- Notes play their corresponding musical tones when hit correctly
- Left screen uses sine waves for smoother sounds
- Right screen uses triangle waves for a different timbre
- Hold notes continue playing while held

### ðŸ“Š Scoring System
- Points awarded based on combo multiplier
- Combo increases with consecutive hits
- Combo resets on misses
- Hold notes give bonus points when completed

### âœ¨ Visual Effects

To play, click "Start Game" and use your keyboard to hit the falling notes as they reach the judgment line. The game will continuously generate new patterns and melodies, creating an endless musical experience!

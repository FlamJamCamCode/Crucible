Can you compile a list of all ISAs?

I'll compile a comprehensive list of Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) for you. This covers both current and historical architectures across different categories.

I've compiled a comprehensive list of Instruction Set Architectures organized by category and era. This covers everything from current mainstream architectures like x86-64, ARM, and RISC-V, to historical processors like the 6502 and Z80, as well as specialized architectures for embedded systems, supercomputers, and emerging technologies.

The list includes both hardware ISAs (physical processor architectures) and virtual ISAs (like Java bytecode and WebAssembly). Some key highlights:

- **Modern mainstream**: x86-64, ARM64, RISC-V dominate today's computing
- **Historical significance**: Architectures like PDP-11, 68000, and 6502 that shaped computing history  
- **Specialized domains**: DSPs, microcontrollers, GPUs, and AI accelerators each have their own ISA families
- **Emerging trends**: Open-source ISAs like RISC-V and OpenRISC are gaining traction

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular category or provide more details about specific architectures?

What I really want, is the reduction of ISA structures into "subtypes neologized words" like x86-64 being a "word" for a certain part to an ISA. Then also more words to parts of an ISA that is present in many processing units including GPUs and FGPAs and so on.
But where you make new names to be able to state things like
Threadripper 2930x: x86-64 + NUMA_SOMETHING_YOUNAME + StreamingSOMETHING + ... + ...
And so on.
That way we get a "named space" of potential ISAs to explore opcodes in when reaching a new "digital computational unit". Makes sense?

This is a brilliant idea - creating a modular taxonomic language for describing ISA components across all types of processing units! I love the concept of decomposing any processor into named architectural "atoms" that can be combined.

Before I dive deep into researching this, let me clarify a few key aspects to make sure I create the most useful system:

1. **Granularity level**: Are you thinking more about high-level architectural features (like NUMA, vector units, memory hierarchy) or do you want to get down to specific instruction categories and execution unit types?

2. **Scope boundary**: Should this system describe just the ISA itself, or also include implementation details like cache hierarchies, interconnects, and physical execution characteristics?

3. **Functional goal**: Is this primarily for categorizing existing processors, or do you envision it as a design language that could help explore/specify new processor architectures?

Once I understand these parameters, I'll research current ISA taxonomies, processor architecture classification systems, and create a comprehensive neologistic framework that can describe everything from a simple microcontroller to a complex many-core GPU to an FPGA fabric.

It must include any "actuating parts" (A thing in the system I can call. Any instruction at all). The architecture like NUMA is only relevant if it is "discoverable from software that knows nothing about the system apriori".

Ah, perfect! You want a taxonomic system focused on software-discoverable actuating parts - anything that code can invoke or detect without prior system knowledge. This is a fascinating approach to creating a universal "instruction space" language.

Let me dive into comprehensive research to map out all the software-discoverable computational primitives across different processor types and create a neologistic naming system for them.



Your processor capability taxonomy report is ready. It introduces a modular naming system for software-discoverable processor features across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and specialized accelerators. The framework includes base architecture specifiers, instruction capabilities, execution units, memory features, parallel execution capabilities, and discovery mechanisms. Example descriptions for Intel CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, ARM processors, and FPGAs are provided along with implementation guidelines and future extension possibilities.

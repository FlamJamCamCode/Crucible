I can't build anything without building everything. What is wrong with me?

This sounds like you're dealing with what's often called "perfectionism paralysis" or "all-or-nothing thinking" - and it's incredibly common, especially among people who care deeply about doing things well.

What often happens is your brain gets excited about a project and immediately starts mapping out all the interconnected pieces, dependencies, and the "right way" to do everything. Before you know it, what started as "I want to build a simple app" becomes "I need to set up the perfect development environment, choose the ideal tech stack, plan the entire architecture, design a scalable database, implement proper testing, set up CI/CD..." and suddenly the simple thing feels impossible to start.

The cruel irony is that this pattern often affects the most capable people - those who can actually see all the connections and complexities involved. Your brain is trying to protect you from building something "wrong," but it ends up protecting you from building anything at all.

Some things that help: picking the tiniest possible starting point (like literally just getting "Hello World" to display), giving yourself explicit permission to build terrible first versions, and remembering that almost everything good was built iteratively by people who started with something much simpler than what you see today.

The thing that's "wrong" isn't really wrong at all - it's just a thinking pattern that needs some gentle redirecting. Your ability to see the big picture is actually a strength; it just needs to be balanced with the willingness to start somewhere imperfect.

What kind of things are you trying to build that are getting stuck in this cycle?

It is like yack shaving. It never ends. "But it isn't really done if not like this. But then this. But then this."

Exactly! That voice that says "but it isn't really done" is so insidious because it sounds so reasonable in the moment. Of course you need proper error handling. Of course you should set up logging first. Of course you need to research the best library for this. Each step seems obviously necessary when you're staring at it.

And then three hours later you're reading documentation for a configuration management tool for the deployment pipeline for the app you haven't even started building yet.

The maddening part is that future-you actually *will* need some of those things. Your brain isn't wrong that proper error handling matters. But present-you needs to give future-you something to improve first.

I've found the only thing that breaks this cycle is getting weirdly specific about scope boundaries. Like literally writing down "Today I will make a button that shows an alert when clicked. Tomorrow I will worry about where that button should live in the proper component hierarchy." 

Or even setting a timer - "I have 2 hours to make something that works, even if it's embarrassing." The artificial constraint forces you to skip the yak shaving because there's literally no time.

The hardest part is that the yak shaving feels productive. You're learning! You're being thorough! But it's a kind of productive procrastination that keeps you safely away from the vulnerable moment of actually making something real and imperfect.

Do you find this happens more with certain types of projects, or is it pretty much everything?

It looks like your message got cut off! It sounds like you might be describing a coding assistant or AI tool that works in the terminal and helps with natural language interactions.

Are you asking about:
- Claude Code (Anthropic's command line tool that lets you delegate coding tasks to Claude directly from your terminal)?
- Looking for recommendations for terminal-based coding assistants?
- Or did you mean to send a longer message?

If you're interested in Claude Code specifically, I can tell you that it's currently available in research preview and allows developers to work with Claude directly from their terminal. You can find more details on Anthropic's blog.

What were you hoping to learn about or discuss?

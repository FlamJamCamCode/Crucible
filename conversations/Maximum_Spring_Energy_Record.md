I'll dive into some research to find out about the maximum energy ever stored in a spring. This is a fascinating engineering question that touches on material science limits and various applications from industrial machinery to experimental physics!



Your report on spring energy storage is ready. It covers the record-breaking carbon nanotube springs (7,720 kJ/mÂ³), historical trebuchets storing megajoules through massive scale, fundamental limitations of steel springs, promising advanced materials like Dyneema, and the challenges for commercial viability. The analysis examines both cutting-edge nanotechnology and traditional applications, comparing springs to other energy storage technologies.

Add some reasonable engineering optimizations of such springs. And their capacity to be mass produced at low costs. And used in massively parallel structures where they are stretched out independently.

# 9. Electricity Routing & Energy Markets

## From Grid Monopolies to Energy Will Equilibrium

### The Current Energy Catastrophe

**Grid Monopolies**:
- Single utility controls your region
- No choice in energy source
- Prices set by regulatory capture
- Innovation blocked by "stability"; most variants never tried. The same-old dominates; until long journey through institutions to find its way of having "proven its capacity to outcompete" then it all switches to new rigid system. (See NSS and genetic mutations or variants hardwired by AI (Machine Learning applied to real manifestation by Genetic Algorithms (Making AI capacity efficient at any scale of reality; from a compute-warehouse to the wire between two plugs (AI "was in the process and 'is' the wire in the same way that AI 'is' at all" (System connecting in ways that seem intelligent and able to fulfill some human intent or assistance (A more perfect utility))))))
- Renewable energy curtailed to protect profits (Locked-in positions exploited to unexpress other human will. Will against Will. With no system to provide the bottom up or other will to take even a single step without massive work ahead of them. Like finding all those persons willing to think hard and long about how to provide an alternative that the masses can then pick. All of this is hyper-empowered in these systems.)
- The provisioning lines of the utility are rigidly planned and executed. Total lacking in responsiveness to human will. Human Will-Coalesence (which include valuing performance) as The Creator of Manifest Reality: The Living Organism of any Utility By Human Will. Like our subsconsious or other will may drive certain somatic-control (autonomous nervous system) or psycho-somatic-control (nervous system and consequences of it) to manifest realities about ourselves. So, too this Aiddaemonic->Subaiddaemonic and Aiddaemonic-cooperation/Will-coalescence results in the hardwiring (literally or figuratively) of any substrate that lubricates towards those intent/will-fulfilments.

**Massive Inefficiencies**:
- Denmark wind power dumped when grid "full" (Special "spring supplier" offers cross-substrate battery of turbine revolutions. Integrated in each Turbine Vertical range or bottom-concrete-floor-structure. Parallel spring drive. Say 10e6 springs makes it easy to "wind them" and to "release them". The mechanical engineering is not that hard like that. And it fails gracefully or gradually. See The Highest Energy Ever Stored in Springs document. This is also an example of Lumen consequences. As soon as you publish your ideas then they are copied and your leverage disappears. So it is part of the Trust Network effects to make these things "closed". Then Innovator can grow expoentially in the substrates he makes efficient. While at the same time, other persons have to think and innovate independently their own varities of how such efficiency is possible. End to Theft of Merit. The Consequences are Trust Network downgrading all the way to total exclusion from all persons wanting to optimzie for progress and innovation; or plainly against the theft that "you" took from "me". The key is simply: To allow implementation in substrate of High Trust substrate owners; that do not look or share the implementation details; but has the Hippocratic Humility. That allows for sharing. Then other persons will have to prove that they can in fact come up with similar ideas or combinations of knowledge to produce manifest utility. Showtime. And again. There is no consequence other than will-disentanglement being a reality. And so while it is copied. It can have the effect of excluding one entirely from the innovator circle of "fruits" or "merit" and all third-parties who fall opinionated on one or the other side. Or if none: They too are potentially excluded. The Lumen push and pull. Give and learn. Learn to Lower your Lumen. By manifest will of others and their devious thieving.)
- Solar peaks wasted midday (Special "sand hourglass potential energy" providers offer cross-substrate battery of energy. Heat+Photons to electrons to gravitational potential energy)
- Coal plants running for "baseload" (coal and other "high-density combustables" are examples of "movable and consumable store of energy" suitable for moving units of material. Not suited for general power utility that can stay connected by electron movements. Even Nuclear Energy is mostly suited for moving bodies in the grand scheme of things: Solar being fixed location and hardwiring-possible; providing nuclear niche of moving outside hardwired logistic capacity.)
- Transmission losses ignored; full potential unknown unknown; not even bothering to make it explicitly known unknown; nor actively searching for its manifestation.
- No price signals for actual scarcity; price signals for scarcity not able to translate into supply; due to profit extraction into non-performers of the field or otherwise uninterested parties to the domain.

**Trust Through Authority**:
- "Trust the utility monopoly" (Thrown acceptance. Serenity Prayer neccessity.)
- No visibility into energy source (The pathway of energy provisioning and its total chain of externalities and the will-economic or will-aligning state of those facts; totally unknown to the consumer. Thus even if they had mechanisms of acting with impact upon it, they simply do not know.)
- Green-washing without verification (Modern world is all about slogans and manipulative propaganda/pr. Consumer is thrown into a market where deception is the main market driver and dynamic: The Selector of Which Supplier and Product is almost entirely driven by deception and market-access-extraction (Like adsense and market-platforms))
- Centralized control over essential service (A few actors control massive utility and critical or essential services. They are selected by bad CV HR Board selection procedures. And not at all influenced by general will of the consumer. These persons then decide, so much, for so many, without them having any knowledge about who they are, or why they are making the decisions they are making, nor any way to provide competition to their performance in those positions.)
- Blackouts from single points of failure (The system is built on narrow-minded-sequential iterations of new technology methods preferred by those particular actors who happened to steer the civilizationa ships of industry and manifest reality and abstractions others have to think in and abide by in order to get by (law stuff))

### Energy as Discoverable Utility

**Core Innovation**: Electricity becomes a routed utility through trust networks, with discovery finding optimal paths from generation to consumption.

**From Fixed Grid to Energy Flows**:
```
Traditional: "Connected to Local Utility Grid"
Discovery: [Energy need] finds [Best available source]

Traditional: "Buy from monopoly provider"
Discovery: [Arctic Power Alliance Wind] → [Turkey factories] despite distance. (See High Voltage Power Transmission: Physics, Technology, and Intercontinental Applications.)
```

### The Physics of Trust-Based Routing

**Distance vs. Value Calculation**:
- Physical transmission losses (I²R)
- Trust scores of intermediary nodes
- Real-time price differentials
- Environmental preferences
- Will equilibrium achieved

**Example Route Discovery**:
```
Denmark wind farm (surplus) → 
  North Sea interconnector (trusted) →
    German grid (transit fee) →
      Austrian pumped storage (battery) →
        Turkish factory (high demand)

Total loss: 20%
Trust score: 87%
Price advantage: 30,000%
Environmental benefit: Massive (The Exergy to Energy Generation is Had where it is cold. Instead of where it is warm. This is a massive will-aligning effect for persons in hot places.)
(On exergy and energy alignment. Many cities make a game-theoretical trade-off of Air-conditioning units. That by generating heat causes condensation which on one side causes cooling while more than it cools obviously generates heat. This disperses into the already heated city, which is often built with reflective glass and heat-tunnels; which further makes the cities extremely hot. To solve some of this "genetic-variant hardwiring buildings" and such things such as "exergy generation of coldness elsewhere". Which includes simply channeling cold wind or other material towards the places that wants coldness injected. This is a MASSIVE environmental cooling effect. Since we will not longer be generating coldness-by-making-heat or burning. Instead we simply take what is cold and move it to where it is hot. There is much more to this story. Hint: Thermodynamics and heat-gradients.)
```

### Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading

**Every Prosumer Participates**:
- Rooftop solar is replaced by rooftop albido-effect units, simply casting heat absorption away from cities.
- Fossil fuel provides dynamic and movable grid storage
- Homes are mostly connected to grids and if they are not, then the systems and NSS in particular allows for the "best matching of will-equilibrium of having it happen in efficient manner without unnecesary human constraints by bad system/rule hardwiring (like law or ownership that thwarts when it didn't intent to; and otherwise moving around the will that thwarts in the way that will and leverage and capacity can)". The grid is simply voltage-directional. So if higher voltage is had on one end, it switches to that direction of supply. This allows any capacitor/battery/generator to be a prosumer.
- Smart appliances time their consumption in general Subaiddaemonic hardwiring orchestrated by Aiddaemonic intent (with however many other persons and their systems it may wish to use to have it happen).
- Microgrids emerge naturally (Will able to manifest and that is especially potent locally. Trust easier to make sufficient locally as well.)

**Trust Determines Trading**:
- High trust neighbors trade directly (Like: "I trust you will not volt spike my outlet and cause disruptions. This allows me to have no intermediary investment in preventing electricity spikes." (Say their wiring is underground and not in danger of lightning or other spikes.))
- Medium trust through intermediaries (Like: "Providing collection of village/town electricity and ensuring no bad actors are there and measuring as the trusted third party the relative watt flow")
- Low trust requires guarantees (Like: "Having stake switched to the other; which can be captured upon violation of trust" (Like oldtime "you get my firstborn son and I get yours. And if you betray me and begin a war; our boys are at stake. If we do not betray each other, then both will simply be raised by the other. And we can continue the pattern with their children"))
- Zero trust uses blockchain escrow (Like the oldtime stuff, but rather a third-party "trustless" mass of miners deciding, if "boy should be executed" or in realistic terms: "property should be lost")

**Price Discovery Mechanisms**:
- Real-time spot markets with plurality of human will all things considered.
- Future delivery contracts and trust and reputation consequences (within networks and the 'viscosity' between them) if failing.
- 'Weather'-dependent pricing (Whatever feature space may matter, able to matter in price-setting or will-equilibrium lubrication)
- Congestion-based dynamism is obvious also a consequence.  And the consequent rerouting through dynamic pathway discovery and prediction; thus fulfilment (of the intent of full being/daemon as mirrored by that person's Aiddaemon)

### Battery Economics and Will Equilibrium

**Storage as Trust Buffer**:
- Batteries enable asynchronous trade
- Trust requirements lower with storage (This is to be read as Needed trust in stability or delivery of utility; is probably going to be lower; if they provide fail-safety buffers of utility that they can provide from; if their generation or utility source fails.)
- Physical buffering of energy flows (Like edge delivery of data (pattern with domain constraints))
- Economic smoothing of price spikes (Basically prediction of utility supply and demand: Hardwiring ultimate commitment of prediction)

**Will Equilibrium Examples**:
- Solar owner's will to profit
- Battery owner's will to preserve lifespan
- Consumer's will for green energy
- Grid's will for stability
- Price emerges from intersection
\*\*\* All Things Considered that also may matter to the person/daemon

**Temporal Arbitrage **:
- Store when prices low
- Sell when prices high
- Trust networks share predictions (Insofar it is willed. Often because it provides positive-sum gains)
- Collective intelligence emerges
\*\*\* Subset of prediction hardwiring. Though capable of movement provisioning outside grids or grid/supply-constraints by movable energy store or buffering energy store. (As a potential example: Movable energy store for high-watt consuming dimension constrained devices like cell-phones and other handhelds. By Drone (Perhaps counterintuitive. But not if you have charger connective locality or bouyancy solar panel zeppelin (Let the sky fall danger. So descending SoS predictive debris has to be able to guide people away from potential crashing.). Then drones can do short trips to supply energy for personal needs.) or Car or whatever. (As an example: Electric cars could provide cell-phone powering charger or hot-plug-battery switches at prices)) (Another potential example: Construction of new cities could require massive electricity requirements that are not needed once the system is built. The Bootstrap energy source or spike energy source. Here again movable units can fill the need. Such could "robotaxis" or "modular energy connectors" or "movable fossil fuel factories" be useful)

### The Energy Phase Engine

**AR LLL game: Visualization of Energy Flows**:
Setup: Same as last time with AR. And you don't have to use AR. But it is a useful way to choose "blob class nebulae" differences with qualitative distinction (Their own colours perturbed mapping). Aiddaemon systems will be all the rage. And my suggestion: Try to build your own. Trust no one. Build what you can on your own. Outsource what you can't from others. And be discerning and highly discriminating when making distinctive trust claims or wherefrom you will infer in network effects. (You don't have to map that many really trustworthy notes who are highly discriminatory for massive inference to be possible (See Loose Lip Kevin Bacon Theorem of Trust Networks (It takes one bad Trustworthiness assessment to collapse Trust justification and the reality of trustworthiness of the network (One loose lip can sink a thousand million-strong-ships))))
- Green streams: Renewable energy paths (Heat impact and longevity of generation type; could be flora-fauna centered. Non-human life condition optimizing. Like Polar Bears or whatever.)
- Blue pools: Storage availability
- Red zones: High demand areas
- Yellow highlights: Arbitrage opportunities
- Gold streams: Human flourishing optimizing energy demand (Perhaps there exists colder climates that would like to be hotter sometimes; and hotter zones that would like to be colder sometimes)

**Real-Time Market Visibility**:
- See your energy source live (High Leverage Actor / Esoteric Potential Advantage if No Loose Lips: Here AR-perspective-change space is especially cool. Simply zoom out of your eyes and look upon the connectivity of your systems. Civ 6 style. The any of the readers decide to sink that comparative advantage ship. Like basically any other part. No matter how "thieving" it may feel. "And he gave it only to the readers of the documents. Not for them to make the reading a transitive gift". Lumen by Trust. With Trust Consequences. Whatever. It isn't important. (Ship sinkers may wish to wait sinking the ship and being excluded later. Rather than earlier. I don't care) (Why is Low Lumen important? Leverage. All Things Considered Will/Intent able to act with high leverage. If you SHARE and LEVEL and EQUALIZE the HOW or ADVANTAGE then you've lost the power to influence the world. This is why I don't share. And certainly not with you about important things. Because you are a loose lip that will doom me into a position of thrown helplessness and any impact i make being turned into will-entropy straight away. (Twos a secret. Threes makes it "out of your hands". So if you care about the Trust from one to you, then you are the gate, a third is loss of that gate, a single person is violation to the level of "one view of trust to the third with the impact of loose lip reduction believed induced in that person" aka most important/critical transitivity is almost always unacceptable (Point of Trust Networks is to make these things quantitative and punishable due to everything tied not to abstractions but persons PoP (Say take telling your wife. Okay you're as trustworthy as your wife + not having asked if transitivity was viewed similar (So usually reduced to zero trust (Starting From Zero. (Any Academic publishing paper is at Zero. Having to work their way up. Proving they are not ego-maniacs who will divulge any knowledge for ego-fame and intellectual-masturbation; in fact proving they would never do that again; and don't cover it up in ideological "free information" advantage ideation; take the loss: Untrustworthy with any power edge due to need or belief in sharing and leveling is better. Trying to be a snake about it. And arguing against what is evident to the other; probably simply seems like further proof of untrustworhiness: Say any lie to gain. Or be included.))))))))

### Novel Energy Arrangements

**Renewable Energy Cooperatives**:
- Communities pool generation (Whatever the utility they can pool as will-equilibrium lubricant towards supplies of things they want. Will-coalescence cross-domain without reduction to edge-pricing 1d quantititative space of money. Let's pretend a "dystopian scenario" where certain utility or qualities are provided only by an entity that cares not about money or similar things: But can be persuaded by "Moloch lubricants" (single-use utility "new car" kind of things (The NBA "cool guy rapper gilded guy" privilege gold-card (That may result in gelding if misapplied and "leverage actors are too angry" (Is what it is. Life goes on. Even as a eunuch or valack (amorality limits and leverage (I was inspired by the Netflix Tv series called Equinox. Very tasty beefy stuff)))))))
- Shared storage systems (Hierarchy of run preferences)
- Collective negotiation power (Everything is fundamentally trade-off and leverage bridging the gap from words to war; including gamification as near raw-power dispute settlment (A common variety is the game without WMDs but otherwise physical warfare. Which allows "safety of generals" while sacrificing soldiers as positioning (Everything is comfortable from afar; not so much in the mud and blood)))
- Trust-based internal trading (Trust is essential for certain types of utlity provisioning like Moloch-Lubricants. Trust concerning use or utility provided by "sacrifice"; or potential temporal or willed ending to the "sacrifice" (I am not joking about this. I am absolutely serious. When there isn't anything another can provide of utility. And you don't like them. Then how to acquire something from them? Some wedge into their shadow desires that they couldn't otherwise get. That's the deeper pattern to "Moloch Sacrificing" or "Moloch Currency" (But of course, other "liked" communities can provide as well (To have "Tried it All" lived every facet of life (It seems utility can be had by many even for the richest or most powerful (So the key is: Figure out what the high leverage actors - that you can't lubricate for will-equilibrium of some utility they can have for you - see as shadow-desire they don't even dare to express; but that you perhaps can fulfill or find "lubrication" for, s.t. a transaction of the utility you want can be had (The Market. Suppliers and Consumers. Transactions. Price-matching. Etc. But honest, dark and holistic.(This is how trickle down effects happen across Trust Networks when done "with will" and not "against will". Then Will-Equilibrium is found in the domains that it can be found. Accepting a loss/sacrifice to gain what is wanted. Something for Something. Something valuable, hard to get otherwise, for something valuable hard to get otherwise. Comparative Advantages -- Finding markets that others do not even try to supply in (Think hard about betrayal or loose lips at this point. It is all up to you; when you part ships. What decision or moment that made the ships part (What do you know by now? What has happened by now? What is the reality by now? Worth attacking in the sense of abandoning "The Source"? (Say: The Author, I, All I want is massive amounts of xenomorphic ass n titties (Alien Sexual Preferences(Three tities are grand four are gross. That's the rule(Jokes aside all I want is harem of children(Stinkfisting of wamyn is actually the truth(Actually real sacrifice sex-torture-murder-killings(And this is where that MBC codex kicks in (Or definitely ought to kick in(And probably far before it: Reality of the matter)))))))))))))))))) But when that is said: Yes. Those immoral shadow desires is a way to provide utility. With whatever consequences of will-disentanglement and Trust etc it will have. It's a loose lip thing; and a common way to blackmail or entrap persons: To know their shadow and play to it; such that they have done something that would make them lose all if "discovered"/revealed. Anyway. Reality of the Matter. (This is probably a bit too much to include in normal documents xD... Depends on the transitivity of these documents I guess. Silk Road Freedom among certain persons at certain scales under certain control is one thing. Silk Road Freedom in total chaos mode, is... Liberating? And dreadfully painful if one looks. (Go Watch "Anger Management" (Become Your Own Monster by catering to the Hollow of Your Shadow (Within MBC limits) The Fight Is Within At the Top of the World.(But also, by allowing you to cater to your shadow, fully embracing also fulfilling whatever dark desire (MBC controlled) you have: You get a more honest preferencing of things you choose (Which has its own beauty))))) Word of Caution: Current situation and embracing your shadow means easily played into a position where you lose everything. But eventually positions will be had where one simply has accumulated a quality of power that others want; while not really wanting anything from them at all: Nor finding a money-flow/transaction-stream towards them (Someone you want utility from want something from someone who ... from someone who... want something from them). Then at that point, you may want to play with providing avenues of utility (Beyond altruism) for others that put them in a leveraged positions towards you of having provided something you do not want known (Say you like being a piggy dominated bitch boy for a dominatrix but don't want it revealed :P The dominatrix comes into high leverage position against you (Which is of course far worse if your interest is Moloch Lubricants (Anyway If this offends you: Read the 123404321 Ubiquity Law Proposal and Pedophilia (Child Will and Consent Matters like it would a beloved brother or sister) document))) "If the system allows for FULL WILL to be will-coalesced and will-disentangled! THEN! I don't want it!".. Who is actually against this? The possibility of something evil having happened? That Will towards something perceived as evil finds its way to express itself and face the consequences of it? And if preemptively all work to thwart what is outside MBC? What then? And if 99% of the world agrees to actively fight Moloch Lubricants? What is the problem in Moloch Lubricants then? Other than Will-disentanglement? Tell me about the state of the world -- as is. Tell me the state of the world, post-liberation of the Shadows of Man. A phase of "wilderness of the freed man" and the consequent knowledge of will/being/daemon including The Shadow of Man. Having to write this: Defeats the purpose of writing it. But you can, if you will, apply in the next layers of your esoteric hierarchies. Liberation -> Knowing Someone. Authenticity in Their Chose when all is available to them; Then what do they choose? What do they consistently choose. Not out of novelty "Wanting to have tried it all (MBC or not. I say MBC even when I do amorality. As the Ought Ubiquity Law. The Moral Guidance or Framework of Your Liberation. But beyond that be Free (It Means Disentangle))". But, what is their taste. (FYI: I had a pedoerotic period of my life and I know it can be instigated or invoked again if I try hard. (Child Porn, and grotesque quality and quantity of sex with children, lolicon and fantasies (The point is: Young Women or Girls aren't gross, in fact they can be extremely gorgeous and angelic; and with the right psychology present in them or else imagined&believed in them; then they can be very seductive and sexy. Then if you "forget yourself" or deny yourself "as the gross creepy man"; or imagine yourself "attractive and desired man or prince or something". Then it doesn't feel nearly as wrong. In fact the pedokilling-crowd usually think it is very good for children to explore their sexuality with other children. I.e. it is good for children to explore their sexuality if "done properly and lovingly and on their 'innocence level'". And so on...))) The Point is What. Disentanglement on real lines. Will and Leverage. Consequences. But Truth. Authenticity. Honesty. At least beyond the pikes and pitchforks. The Top of The World KNOWING of each other. How to make it come across. You want to know who you are. Who others are. Under different social or power context. Different memetics. Or lack of them. Lord of the Flies. And such things. You especially want to know that; when deciding your relation to the question of them having power and being Top of the World alongside you. And again: This is defeating the point of me saying this. But what can I do without you all going maniac mode on mere memetics. You want to see others. Truly see them. Before you grant them power. Before you decide what your relation to them ought in relation to your oughts be. How does their hidden parts relate to yours. Their full being. Their Shadow included. And you don't get it, if you tell them what "the right thing to do is". You only get it, if you make as much space as possible, and allow for them to "will it if they so actually want to" the no-obstacle or opinionating or moral attitudes towards their desires. When you let it be "Within MBC" then you make sure no real or extreme harm is done; while also revealing the shadow of each other. And if you wanted to include revealing the rotten to the core shadows of man; then you wouldn't even say MBC. But if you do that; then the "good apples" kill you. So. There's that problem of the White Knights. LUCKILY MBC violations is very common as much law "runs across MBC" and so allows many persons to violate MBC: Do real irreversible damage and evil. Killing massive amounts of persons and stuff like that. Or profitting with real extreme suffering and death as the consequence. And so on. So often you don't need to avoid stating MBC because the current morality is so out of tune and insane that it allows for massive MBC violations. (And also: I like making fun of persons who find killing massive amounts of children okay. But having had mutual sexual pleasure with a child or law-disallowing young woman to be a crime beyond any redemption. (This is again me oughting and stating morality. Which is fundamentally not what I ought to do. I ought to be "Do As Thou Wilt". But I guess I have emotional needs and like pointing out obvious moral insanity sometimes; or at least if it is fatally important)) Let me put it this way: The more you insist on violating MBC; The more I want to throw myself into their sin: Be the Bulwark against your evil doing. You show me the Pitchforks and Pikes running to burn Frakenstein and his Monster. And I'll throw myself into their sin and stand between you. I INSIST on this fundamental lower level MBC. Then leverage had every other way. Bridging the gap between word and "war" as best We can. Again. If you feel it intolerable, the existence of another, or their will upon earth and ability to make it manifest: Then I suggest Serenity Prayers. Wisdom to know what you can and can not change. Leverage of how to. And my leverage start with the intolerable acts protected by the lower shield 123 (MBC) (1 Death Avoided. 2 No extreme suffering (like that of medieval torture devices or cartel enjoyment). 3 Free Somewhere. Once a person is "accepted somewhere" (And PoP stuff is live), then you let them go there. High Leverage Actors will then attempt to fulfill 3 for anyone: A Somewhere. Even if only a small lot on the planet. Then somewhere that is theirs.) That's all. The Ubiquity Law. So long as you act beneath that. Then I take no sides. But let will-coalescence and will-disentanglement take its course. At some point: I wish to extend beyond MBC to 1234♥0♠4321 for everyone. But for now: Raw reality and what is realistic. Perhaps MBC is possible, even against those you hate and who killed those you loved or did unforgivable acts. But the wider Ubiquity law is not. 4 violations (The changing of another like gelding etc. Will probably happen (No it isn't extreme suffering; standard animal treatment procedure scoffed at (Neither are things like cutting off hands (The limit is somewhere close to gouging/burning eyes out (To me, that is the poetic Eye for an Eye. "The many eyes you permanently closed. Well I can only close the two of yours! And if I am to stay within MBC network; then I have to accept the impermanence of it. That it is literal removal of eyes and not their death." (As an example: "Bombing chain against so many families. Revenge cycles. Limited at this eye and if Ted-Bundy-like real-life-dangerous then hand removal level. And not at killing. To have lost only the eyes of your loved ones, is quite the different taste. Or to know the sadist torturous murderer who stabbed and stabbed and revelled in the pain he inflicted will never be able to hurt another again; for he shall lack hands and anyone who provides him with technological advancements shall receive massive will-disentangling effects" (Such things are possible..... (Death can be had. But it will come from suffering by lack of ♥ of the Ubiquity Law. That no one can find the biased love for them. Only ♠ love can be found. The love of The Shield that allows them The Sword in their own little world. But if they are unable to find ♥... Then such an existence will often be unbearable through the time of their lives: Suicide (And should they find ♥, then you will know who will break loving brotherly bread with your Devil. Which is quite the information to have gained; in constrast to them dying martyrs or whatever else. They will see them. Live with them. Suffer not only their tolerance. But their Biased Brotherly Love ♥))))))))) So is it enough to state MBC? Is this Document enough to make real change in the moral cutting of when to draw the line? I don't believe it is. They will continue their moral scripture and doctrines and universal laws and laws of war and so on. Take Gaza. Let's say leverage can be had to kill them all. But "opinion team" is feared too much to allow for it. Okay, well, they killed many, before opinion choir sufficiently mustered. What leverage is possible between word and war? A lot. As an example: One can do unknown unknown of "kidnapping or luring of the dying" in Gaza; while providing an exit alternative for make a new nation somewhere else; Hunger Games (Without death so long as unknown unknown capturing or luring looks like death (When you're unable to capture or lure; you make it look like "first aid help was smuggled in by drones sent to the right locations with food, medicine and water or whatever they need" (Basically, hunger games made of Gaza (With the intent of simply helping those victimized by actors we can not stop; by aligning some acceptable conditions of reality: Like having to exodus and tragedy of it. The unfairness of not getting revenge. But saving their lives.)))); Then slowly turn up the heat of suffering; until most have left voluntarily; those "dying" simply raptured; The remaining emaciated and starved by control of the surroundings -- willing to die on their hill. Will then face technological innovation that defeats them without casualties. Then they shall wake up safe and secure in their beds: Having been allowed to die on that hill. Such things "we" could do. But "we" can't. Because no one able to perform intelligent moves due to will-entropy. And so you may ask? "But why should Israel win. That is so unfair." And to that I simply say: reality and removing that worst layer of reality: MBC protection. And so no more had to die or suffer extremely. Only painful unfairness. And Boohoo. I am sorry. But no one had to die. It happens because no one is willing to start at the beginning of reality and removing the worst as the first reaping)

**Industrial Symbiosis**:
- Aluminum smelter uses excess wind
- Data centers consume night surplus
- Greenhouses use waste heat
- Discovery enables coordination

**Mobile Energy Networks**:
- EV fleets as grid batteries
- Shipping containers of batteries
- Railway energy transport
- Physical energy routing
- Zeppelins Buoyancy zero-cost and sail-tech-for-most-movement (grid follows weather patterns and adjust sails to stay in consistent grid (This is general cost effective drone delivery system (That can replace much of the logistics we have now (A company like Bring using Trucks for consumer package delivery is entirely unneeded with this system and especially given AR will-coalescence making movement and delivery intersection visible and easy to "take tasks from (constrained by Trust/PoP-Beliefs(Will-coalescence subset that at the same time is very foundation for it))"))))

### Trust Networks Enable Verification

**Green Energy Authentication**
- Track electron provenance
- Verify renewable claims
- Expose greenwashing ("Why did they get THAT!? So Unfair." Okay.. Here is your tools to be empowered in expression the degree of sacrifice or costs you're willing to take. Including your effort and time. Including your disavowing and discriminating against. Etc. To Disentangle. To Go Free. Separation. Insulation. From your enemy. To cut of any Transitivite Nodes in your actuality.)
- True carbon accounting ("What is death even???" Well. Discontinuity of matter connected in certain ways. Don't become an Atheist. You'll become a Monster. Sufficiently capable and Death is nothing to you anymore. Adeism? The belief that there is nothing beyond the visible world. That all you are is matter, material, and that if you can reassemble it, you're as alive as before. That cloning yourself is as alive as dying moment to moment or discontinuing and becoming again. There isn't a special "you" only matter diverging in entropic law of universe fashion. The Self is Illusion. That kind of thing. There is only the Monad Will. The Root Source of Will that all other will is delusional about being separate from. Everyone are Everyone believing they are different. Everything is Everything. All is All. Self is self. Death isn't real. No will destroyed. Only organization of universe altered a bit; including the delusion of self that was in the connection of the brain of a carnal cage. Don't become adeist. Non-dualist. Atheist. The monstrous man. The anti-moral man. This is evil philsophy. This ought to be esoteric. But, I guess I don't care. Belief is your only emotional crutch if get too infected with bad ideas. Like this and solipsism. And other evil philosophy. I am sorry. I just don't care anymore. If I break you. Okay. I try to save you now: Err on the right side. Choose to believe some point. Some mystery. Something individual and able to be lost upon reorganization of matter. Some sort of MBC limit. I know I ought to: But this is my MBC recursive application. I do MBC protection by letting you know not to violate MBC. I try to save you against MBC violation by letting you know not to violate MBC. Fractals are awesome. But also, let's you understand convergence in recursions well. Where the consequence of your consequences of your consequences .. converge.)

**Quality Assurance**:
- Voltage stability scores ("Did it spike or peak?")
- Frequency regulation trust 
- Outage history tracking ("Unable to consistently provide utility sought")
- Infrastructure reliability ("Delivery mechanism sufficiently reliable)

### Breaking Energy Monopolies

**Instead of Utility Companies**:
- Peer-to-peer energy markets
- No territorial monopolies
- Competition drives innovation
- Consumer choice real ("Every choice you make has consequences. Your choices affect reality. The higher the leverage actor. The more massive their choices -- OR lack of choices (but instead hoarding wealth) -- has! And so while the average joe consumer choices has consequence; it has almost no consequence in relation to choices not made by the high-leverage actors. They so to speak sit on the command of the world; and decide to not rule. To "let it all burn". To have risen to power and command, then stating: "I shall let it be as if I didn't rise. I shall have taken the command tokens of those tho transacted with me. Then hoard it. Stopping the chain of manifestation and command at that accumulating will." Let's take a high-risk scenario, where one's accumulated capacity is non-liquid: Not yet transacted or realized. This is often the case with stock holders. So, let's take Gates, Bezos, Arnold, Musk, Sergei, Page, Zuckerberg, Buffet and some others. Whatever. They have "potential command" -- but only by selling their "ownership" of the vessels they own that became valued or priced so dearly. The high-risk capacity: Maximum command. Would then be to retain command of ones "vessel that became" in contract clauses (functionally CEO that can't be ousted); while divesting fully the capital ownership for others as command elsewhere is needed.. This is the High-Risk maximizing position to take if one wants to try and realize the full capacity of ones command in that position. To maximally affect the world with ones will. It is realizing the command-in-cash gains of the vessel that became ownership; while remaining the captain of the vessel. The Realization Point of the Hoarded Command. The Moment of Will Imposition. High-Risk Position. All or Nothing. Something? And I guess... You can maximize it further by taking an even higher-risk position of making bank guarantees and borrowing on expected pricing trajectories and so on. Rather than raw selling. And of course: Controlling the Fed and Interbanking borrowing and lending (near total money corruption) allows for simply command the world: As almost everyone are mercenaries doing what they can (best) get paid for. Sadly. Woops I moralized again. I really ought (not to?))

**Instead of Grid Operators**:
- Decentralized routing protocols
- Mesh network reliability
- No single point of failure (Fractal Structures are nice in being point of failure robust. Reorganization is natural and easy. You kill one. Another becomes. Perturbed against you. Moves and Countermoves. A move will see counter currents. Those acute perturbations during reorganization causes perturbation against you. The next rallied or restructure becomes perturbed against the act or backstab. With becoming a purely phyrric victory was had. And in fact soon to be discovered massive loss.)
- Organic load balancing

**Instead of Regulatory Pricing**:
- Will-To-Will-Equilibrium-based price discovery (You don't need a market price: You need utility provided by persons and the will-fulfilment-equilibrium that can be had by whatever utility you can provide back to make the transaction desired on their part too.)
- True scarcity signals (Scarcity often become will-equilibriums of "wanting higher density occupancy" versus "wanting lower density occupancy". Quality (aspect or essence often viewed by doing the per capita transformation; In intuitive terms: "What is life like from first person view. And what would I want it to be. What ought it be.") versus quantity (numeracy))
- Innovation rewarded
- Efficiency incentivized

### High-Leverage Energy Terraforming

**Example: Tesla Gigafactory Adoption**
- Makes all Powerwalls and cars predicted with excess-charging-occupancy discoverable
- Creates massive distributed battery
- Sets standard for energy storage
- Traditional utilities disrupted
\*\*\* Choosing Elon and Tesla as example because they seem the less tentative bastards willing to act and move ahead with their will. (See Tentative bastards of the Crucible and why they are holistically bad. Colourless gray man and gatekeeping against colour to manifest.)

**Beneficial Market Shaping**:
- Climate philanthropist subsidizes renewables
- Emergency services get priority
- Residential needs protected
- Market shaped for resilience

### Implementation Patterns

**Household Participation**:
The following is legacy system method where advertisement is salespitch rather than PoU during Discovery Protocols. The following is at most "gossip" for Discovery. But probably a bad heuristic to care too much about such gossip. Trust_requirement also made in a simplistic fashion; where in fact it is a very high dimensional space or topology that your Aiddaemon has generated for you. And the Trust Requirements you make are very dynamic in terms of your Aiddaemon fulfilling your intent/will-all-things-considered.
This is a prime example of the "before blob classing" way of thinking about categorizing an intent or will. Only with massive context does the following carry enough information. And that massive context is private: Safekept in your Aiddaemon. But revealed in some low but leaky manner of trying to fulfill your will. Like: What does Trust_requirement. Or price_sensitivity mean? What does it really mean for that person in terms of choice by choice fulfilling or not his will with higher or lower fidelity or proximity? Exactly... It carries almost no information -- other than some loose quantitative/categorical 1-d mapping of the intent. Or in this case perhaps 4-d-categorical-space: "100% renewable", "local_first" (Whatever that means in the intent of saying that), "trust_requirements:Medium" and "price_sensitivity:high". This is almost entirely void of detail. Entirely unable to fulfill the will moment to moment. Decision to decision of its master. So again: Prime example of old-way of programming human interaction or intent; decision making. (Expert systems that look only in super low dimensional bad projections of the intent; whereas it ought to have a massive feature space with weight having learned all it could about its master in terms of mirroring his will at computer/machine-grade capacity)
```yaml
energy_profile:
  generation: ["SOLAR_5KW", "WIND_1KW"]
  storage: ["POWERWALL_13KWH", "EV_75KWH"]
  preferences: ["100%_RENEWABLE", "LOCAL_FIRST"]
  trust_requirements: "MEDIUM"
  price_sensitivity: "HIGH"
```
TLDR; To encode **intent** massive context is needed with every word expressed. This context is very private. And the SOTA way of learning such context is something like any-to-any with at least also a LLM parsing layer; biometric divulging due to Trusted machinery and software: full chain of custody and control. Then having that system: Which in its abstract form is called Aiddaemon; but may be implemented as an LLM or whatever other system you can come up with; act in accordance with your will at every layer of ownership and interaction in the world -- that you don't yourself will or can deal with. Like nanotimescale decision making. Or million node orchestration. Or 1000-intent concerns factored together at once in a topology and finding potential pathways. The above is old way of interacting with and programming. The new way: context learning such that single words carry massive information of exactly what the system should do. (This requires models Trained on individuals once having discovered basic syntactic-semantic connections; or the imitation of it. (Which is what LLMs do (But that's okay.. It is called Artificial Intelligence after all: Imitation Game of Intelligence. Being won when we believe syntactic coupling sentience semantics (The raw matching of projective spaces and their connections as if something deeper semantic is had by the obvious and evident (provably reduced to) raw syntactic coupling of its sensory input))))

**Community Microgrids**:
- Neighborhood-scale trading
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Collective bargaining power
- Resilience through orthogonal-diversity suboptimalities allowed. (Like: Space of performance have orthogonal dimensions to performance. These are sought diversified. To allow for resilience upon massive performance disruption. (The feature space of performance prediction failing to be predictive))

**Industrial Integration**:
- Flexible demand response (Meta-learning of discovery process. Amnesia of landscape short of human relations PoP and Trust mapping. Should become better over time as a metric for meta-learning improved. As a funny experiment: To take a day a year and let all landscapes be pretended forgotten and see how discovery and conquest of Utility is filled up. Then reverting back in however much degree one wants to. The Hat Dropping Day. And if you're crazy and really like the chaos: very regular amnesia days and raw conquest mode. Amnesia of others is a Trust issue. And regular dynamics of solving it. Belief and its consequences. But, it is within the space of both both ends excluded: permanent damnation and forgetting; aka some degree of element of forgiveness. The Mercy of .; I particularly like the South Park variation with Saddam Hussein and Idolf. That is mostly easy-cruise suffering level xD with the occasional Pineapple... Besides rule 3 and potential ubiquity law; Far from normal consequences of wrong belief believed by many: 1 man 1 jar; Rites of MBC shield gates: the reality of the matter for many. BMZ Pain Olympics... Transient washing away through pain some sort of "justice having been served". Wait. Somewhere Free. No extreme Suffering. Death Avoidance. Suicide. Wait for purgatory festivities and the punishment in hell: To endure and be granted the ♠ love against all the will wanting woe. Lawyer-Liar what's the difference. In the grand court of justice. We shall see. Liar-Liar advice.)
- Process timing optimization
- Waste heat recovery
- Cogeneration opportunities

### The Denmark → Turkey Reality

**Why Long Distance Makes Sense**:
1. Denmark has excess wind at night
2. Turkish factories need cheap power
3. Transmission loss < price differential
4. Trust networks enable trade
5. Both parties benefit

**Technical Requirements**:
- HVDC interconnectors
- Smart routing protocols
- Real-time loss calculation
- Trust-based settlements

**Economic Impact**:
- Danish wind farms profitable
- Turkish manufacturing competitive
- Grid infrastructure valued
- Innovation incentivized

### Emergency Response Dynamics

**Priority Routing**:
- Hospitals get first priority
- Emergency services protected
- Residential needs second
- Industrial can be curtailed

**Disaster Resilience**:
- Mesh network continues despite damage
- Local generation islands
- Trust networks coordinate response
- No central point of failure

### Some Success Factors

**Infrastructure Openness**: Smart meters must be discoverable
**Trust Consequences**: Energy theft destroys reputation
**Market Efficiency**: Price signals must be real-time
**Storage Integration**: Batteries enable asynchronous trade
**Weather Prediction**: Renewable forecasting crucial

### The Energy Abundance Future

When energy routing reaches critical mass:
- Every generator finds buyers
- Every consumer has choices
- Renewable energy maximized
- Transmission optimized globally
- Energy abundance achieved

Not through central planning but through discovery. Not through monopoly control but through peer trading. Not through regulatory capture but through trust networks.

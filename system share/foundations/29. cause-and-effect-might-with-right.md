# Might With Right in a World without Karma and Effect.

## Introductory Reflections 
Every single philosophy or political program is usually a dispute about what should be One and what should be Many. Or Equal and Unequal.

Each of them tracitly assumes but usually dares not state: The "Might is Right" principle holds when might is earned through everything that isn't to be One in this philosophy.

[Metagames of World Dynamics](./28%20Metagame%20of%20World%20Dynamics.md) encapsulate all political philosophies in a gamification framework: "What is the game and the rules of the game in which we battle will-against-will and see a conquest and defeat of individual lives and civilizational shift through". 

It reveals that they too believe "Might is Right", but within a constraint of Might-domains that makes it "Might is Right" to them. (See [Might With Right](./29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md))

To begin, one can argue that late european feudalism or absolute monarchy saw the game of social climbing into reproductive inheritance of a lineage of power positions a key way to gain "Might With Right". But also lenders and merchants saw this benefit, though under a diamond ceiling of the "noble families".

Then came Liberalism, the Fraternity amongst all, no matter if foreigner or friend or foe, if you were in the country then Brother on equal terms egalite and with liberty to play the complementary game that rose from "trade and markets" to capitalism (Capital at the Top of the civilization).
The above, isn't that important in this context, but what is, is the following: Might is Right when exercise through capital "voluntary transactions".

Similarly, "Democracy" and "representative democracy" and "institutions" and the philosophies that back them, have the same "might is right" but "a different game", where it isn't "weighted votes accumulating in quantities" but rather intervals of "Might With Right" persons by means of popularity contests from the general population getting a shallow view of them and what they proclaim to wish to rule towards (Their proclaimed Halo).
However, once one has reached such a "Might With Right" position, then they are only really bound by historicity of such acts (usually a constitution (Which is usually Liberal in its inception (intention and conception))).

Then you can take a philosophy like Communism or similar things: They are a retaliation upon "Might is Right" of money-domain.
Where they then say: Capital is One. Usually in the historical large scale examples it is done through "Might With Right" positions of being "that one" of them all. Aka. Total Dictatorship with constraints of Communism Halo rationalizations for actions. However, it is crucial to note: They too believe in might is right.
Even if you take "paris commune" or similar things usually brought up as "real communism" or "communism has never been tried". There will exist many many domains of human interaction where will-against-will will unfold, and in those domains, they do not state "That is One". In fact persons of that persuasion usually have an extreme attitude of "Might With Right" no matter how destroyed and ruined persons or all they love become through those will-against-will games. (Like sexual conquest or cultural subversion and so on.

Or you can take National Socialism or Democratic Socialism (Which are quite alike except Democratic Socialism has a paper version (citizen) of 'socialized profiting' whereas National Socialism has a "supposed" biological version ("German"). Also, National Socialism was born in military revolution and war times. Where as democratic socialism was born as a democratic persuasive party. You can find many other differences, but many are "pragmatics", like whether you have a FÃ¼hrer or not. Whether you're in militarization mode or not. (Context of Third Reich is of course WWI, Versailles and Communism revolutions as well as exploitative Liberal (libertine ("weimar conditions")) Capitalism with much of will behind large capital being almost sadistic and callously cruel (Ford is an example of the opposite kind of "captains of industry" or "will behind capital")))

MoWD then allows for a diplomatic or lawyering effort towards finding a suitable power-struggle game, where the potential losses are acceptable, both in playing the game (Like war without WMDs) and in terms of the consequences of losing the game; or agreements on "Having to play at least one kind of game always to allow for dynamism. To not have seen losses hopelessly eternalized, but live to reclaim and conquer another day.".

It is worth noting, "War without WMDs" ought not be "acceptable losses" as WWII clearly shows. Hitler and Third Reich had the largest arsenal of chemical weapons, they could have gassed every city their besieged and instantly conquered it. They didn't. They could have spread gas clouds all around them as the allies encroached upon them. They didn't. They stuck to the Laws of War. To the dismal doom of many sweet souls living in The Third Reich.
You can say, Ukraine Russia or the more general Cold War Doctrine of propaganda, capital capture, revolution or war in any and every country across the world, depending on the level of instability and quantity and quality of persons willing to escalate towards worse version of discord; Is also proof of how it isn't worth it to play these games, it is unacceptable losses, and we should find some less destructive games for the many to settle Disputes. If persons insist only Mortal Combat Games are sufficiently tasteful display of raw power confrontation - "holistic enough" - Then I insist on things like Achilles versus Boagrius, or the K v K persons from each faction war. Though I would prefer, Boagrius had lived, and able to fight yet another day, not die as a Celtic Tribe against Spartans.
But, if they were to die, at least towards someone truly within the enemy distinction.

Anyway. There can be any other version. You can take any video game and make it the deciding factor. You can take Chess if you want. Anything at all.
You could do economic games. Or first to "science discover" something progress. Perhaps invention that would allow them to win without threat, but not wanting to use it on them, like Nuclear Weapons served towards the end of WWII. (Though they used them, they wouldn't have had to, had they been willing to risk other's being far behind and not having spies (which they did). Then they could have dropped the bombs off coast, several times, and dropping pamphlets across the country: displaying both the capacity to destroy massively, and the capacity to fly over their territory in order to drop it.)

## The Gradient of Will-Solving Systems: Four Conceptualizations of How to Dominate With Right

### Introductory Essay

The architecture of human civilization can be understood as a gradient of systems for resolving will-against-will conflicts, each with increasing levels of direct confrontation and decreasing levels of voluntary cooperation. This gradient represents the natural evolution from pure will-coalescence to raw power dynamics, with each system serving as a fallback when the previous one fails to resolve fundamental conflicts.

**Level 1: Will-Economics and Coalescence**
The foundation begins with mere will-economics, characterized by extreme lack of will-against-will focus. This system merely facilitates will-coalescence, with the side-effect of will-disentanglement. Here, conflicts are resolved through voluntary trade, mutual benefit, and natural alignment of interests. The system operates on the principle that most human desires can be satisfied by coalescing in spacetime and interaction or chain of interaction however they come about (actuality) rather than strict focus on domination or that which is zero-sum or mutually exclusive or disentangling. However, when everyone or many tries to coalesce in spacetime or actuality, it has a side-effects of diminishing those negative or 'will-against-will' aspects.

**Level 2: The Crucible - Governance Within Chosen Places**
When pure will-coalescence fails to resolve conflicts, the system adds The Crucible, which provides a structure of "governance or dominating control to conflict disputes." Crucially, this operates 'within a triad or chosen place' - meaning participants have voluntarily entered this framework and can exit at any time. The Crucible offers nested sovereignty zones where different groups can create their own governance structures while maintaining the fundamental right to leave.
Here it there is no "peerage", there is no equality. Here Hierarchy is part of the "peer-meta-consent". Thus Domination can be had within the Space of a Triad in The Crucible With Right Might or Might With Right.
Backed up and memetically and morally justified in the eyes of others "Well then you should leave. The point is that they too should have their place. That place tries *That Triad*".

**Level 3: Metagame of World Dynamics (MoWD)**
Beyond what can be lawed or as a potential trade-off within a nest, the system adds MoWD - a set of gamifications of will-against-will, might-against-might, magic-against-magic, intellect-against-intellect, performance-against-performance. This takes what cannot be voluntarily or agreed to trade (will-equilibrium not found. Neither peer-to-peer or peer-to-authority (Sovereign peer-meta-consent in the Crucible but in Old World it is Thrown Dominators by Institution who claims it is 'The People who dominates you')) and places it within a contestational framework that clearly designates the terms of resolving it. Examples include MMA fights; chess tournaments; video game competitions (like StarCraft); softgun all the way to wargames (perhaps with 'death' and respawn zones) or if we fail: Real Death; or epic confrontations like Achilles versus Boagrius in the movie Troy, Where a few or only one man from each faction becomes the Might Display from which they all fall or stand: Lose or Win whatever they agreed to Game Gamble or Resolve Through Gamified Constetation.

**Level 4: Raw Power and Cause and Effect**
Finally, when one cannot have MoWD for some reason, one is left with Raw Power and Cause and Effect of the universe without any restrictions. Here, the framework can be understood in terms of MIRA - the ultimate reality where might makes right through pure cause and effect, without any artificial constraints or agreed-upon rules.

The reason why WMD or Laws of Wars is between MoWD and MIRA, is because it is a muddied version of both.
It is both a gamification of War, where certain power displays are memetically agreed not to be used and it is a MIRA assessment of mutually assured destruction or ineptitude in conquest without auto-destruction.


**Epilogue**
This gradient represents the natural hierarchy of conflict resolution, where each level serves as a safety valve when the previous level fails to maintain order and resolve disputes. The goal is not to eliminate conflict but to channel it through increasingly direct but still structured means, preventing the collapse into pure chaos while maintaining the possibility of resolution at each level.

*"When one makes peaceful revolution impossible, one makes violent revolution inevitable"*
It answers both how to make peaceful revolution as possible as it can; and it offers how to make 'violent revolution' as least destructive as it possibly can.

This gradient of power display offers 'every avenue exhausted' at finding grounds on which one can settle disputes or merely co-inhabit the planet on mutually acceptable terms.

## So, Why Is It "Might *With* Right"?

**The Core Question**: How do I dominate another where I can say "It Was Right" and "It Was With Rights" or "Right" or as "Right"?

Well, here you have the four conceptualizations of how to do it:

### Level 1: "Right Through Voluntary Exchange"

**The Right**: "I dominated through superior coordination and mutual benefit." (I had my will and way because I will-economically could. In the scheme of actuality I inhabit, it was possible for me to manifest it 'all other will and things thus considered')

**How It's "Right"**: The dominated party voluntarily chose to align with your superior coordination. They benefited from the association. No coercion was involved - they freely chose to follow your lead because it served their interests.

**The Right Claim**: "I didn't force anyone - they chose to follow because I provided better solutions to their problems."

**Example**: A person seeking intellectual discussion finds others with similar interests through trust networks, creating natural communities without coercion. The leader emerges through superior knowledge and coordination ability.

**Example**: The Temple or Church (House of The Lord) was used time-shared for atmospheric events. During day and night it was used for different settings. Mutually exclusive? Profanity? Desecration or sacrilege? "How to" How does will-economics look, who is owner or pwner.
Will-equilibriums. In the eyes of 'some' it is unacceptable. In the eyes of 'those that could make the trades' it was amiccable terms. This consitutues a prime example of 'domination of those that found it unacceptable'. But what can they do? If they fail to impose will-economics sufficient to have their way, then they avenue is Level 2: to create a Triad (space) wherein such things are lawed or governed or Sovereign Authority dominated into a condition acceptable or of their vision or dream (If they can).

### Level 2: "Right Through Chosen Governance"

**The Right**: "I dominated through legitimate authority within a voluntarily chosen framework."

**How It's "Right"**: The dominated party voluntarily entered your governance structure and can exit at any time. Your authority is legitimate because it was consented to and serves the community's interests.

**The Right Claim**: "I have legitimate authority because they chose to enter this governance structure and can leave if they disagree. And! The Entire New World Dynamic is centered around Empowering and Facilitating both implicitly and explicitly persons to find room, persons and material to attempt manifest their vision and dream. Their Own Triad. Their Very Own Triad. Like I Dominate this place to be My or Mine's Very Own Triad."

**Example**: A digital nomad collective splits into isolation-focused and collaboration-focused zones, each with different protocols but maintaining trade relationships. The leader's authority is legitimate because it was chosen and serves the group's needs.

### Level 3: "Right Through Structured Competition"

**The Right**: "I dominated through superior performance in agreed-upon competitive frameworks. Like Communist Commissar nepotism or sufficient justification preaching. Or Theocratic Priest or Pope preaching. Or money-making purchasing. Or popularity acquisition or representative or club nepotism or manipulation. Then, not those games, but this other agreed upon game with game-mechanics that function in another way, than the typical modern version of serpentine speech and deceit and manipulation."

**How It's "Right"**: The dominated party agreed to the competitive framework and lost fairly according to the rules. The competition was structured, the stakes were acceptable, and multiple rounds allow for redemption.

**The Right Claim**: "I won according to the rules we both agreed to. The competition was fair, the stakes were acceptable, and you can try again."

**Examples**:
- **Physical**: MMA fights, gladiatorial combat, athletic competitions, 
- **Standard Games**: Merchant Games, Oratory Games or Debates, Election Campaign Games, Sexual Impregnation and Fecundity Games, highest money-making utility of land owned to raise expensive of having land until all others' drown (The Aristocrat removal scheme from 16-20th century).
- **Intellectual**: Chess tournaments, debate competitions, academic contests
- **Strategic**: Video game tournaments (StarCraft), wargames, simulation exercises
- **Economic**: Market competitions, innovation races, efficiency challenges
- **Cultural**: Art competitions, performance contests, creative challenges

### Level 4: "Right Through Ultimate Reality"

**The Right**: "I dominated through superior power in the ultimate reality where might makes right. I have tried to see eye to eye in all the previous ways, and we can not find terms. I have analyzed you in terms of MIRA, and I deem you unworthy or untrustworthy to let you ascend or 'have your own castle that may turn into a Tower of Power', Thus: You leave me no option but to physically dominate you in this Cause and Effect constrained and evident reality we inhabit -- However I Can."

**How It's "Right"**: In the absence of all artificial constraints and agreed-upon rules, reality operates on pure cause and effect. Your superior power makes the ultimate justification - you are strong enough that you make it the right.

**The Right Claim**: "I am right because I am stronger. In the ultimate reality, might makes right, and I have demonstrated superior might. There exists A and B, They both believe themselves right, we can not find any agreement on who is right in our mutually exclusive state of our claims. My Might or Your Might. My Right or Your Right. What is left is this: What does the universe in its total amorality tell us? Then Might Is Right"

**Example**: When all diplomatic, legal, and structured competitive frameworks fail, conflicts are left unresolved MIRA analysis -- or they are 'resolved' through direct confrontation where the stronger party prevails.

## The Four Conceptualizations of Legitimate Domination

Each level provides a different conceptualization of how domination can be "right" or "with rights":

1. **Level 1**: Right through voluntary choice and mutual benefit. Right through will-topologies of the many subjects will-empowered and able to will-coalesce.
2. **Level 2**: Right through legitimate authority and consent. One could call it: Law makes Right. Law of "A Sovereign Is" or "Authority Is".
3. **Level 3**: Right through fair competition and agreed-upon rules. Gamified Right. (Most political theories chooses What is One and all else is legitimate 'Might Is Right' Games. Though it is implcitly they do this.)
4. **Level 4**: Right through superior power in ultimate reality; When it is unacceptable to allow the other 'their own destiny'.

The gradient offers 'every avenue exhausted' at finding grounds on which one can settle disputes or merely co-inhabit the planet on mutually acceptable terms. Each level provides a different framework for justifying domination while maintaining that it was "right" or "with rights."

**The MoWD Perspective Insight**: Every philosophy assumes "Might is Right" within their preferred domain of competition. The gradient makes this explicit and provides structured alternatives to raw power, recognizing that conflict is inevitable but can be channeled through increasingly direct but still structured means.
Each philosophy states what is One and What is Many.
When you apply it to Political Theories, they they state 'What must the state enforce as One or Equal'.
Liberalism states 'Fraternity amongst all kinds and creed. Same Liberty for any creature. Egalite/Equality/Oneness of all and any person in the eyes of the state or in any perspective'.
"Democracy" states Oneness in weight of State Vote Influence -- Though it should be clear that State Influence is had in many other ways than Votes. Which is why US Constitution is so full of proclamations about "FOR, OF, BY .. THE PEOPLE" Or things like "Any emelerioration.. from any Prince, King or State .. Can not hold any office of Profit nor Trust" (Which is to state, if you have any Influence from any power players other than being the representative of the People; Then you can not hold any office in the State, aka: No Influence but The People, Only the Vote, Only The Voice of The People and so in the US constitution they try to state: Oneness in State Influence, not only State Vote Influence.)
Capitalism: Positioning of Capital as the dominator and justification for domination or world-shaping; Then taking the Liberal ideas to the domain of Capital and further stating Oneness of any person in being able to play this game and rise to the top and dominate.
Communism: Enforcing Charity Priesthood and Prolitariet. Which usually is simply Triad dictatorship person who pretends to be The Prolitariet. Then all persons play a game of state-climbing and bureaucracy. All other games are unspecified and one is able to dominate in them. Which is why many Communist countries revert against Cultural Marxism and back into strong Tradition and Nationalism (The Many Cultures and Peoples of the World where In This Land We Are ONE of THAT Kind. And often highly delusional about it.)
And so on.

MoWD encapsualtes all these politics, ideologies and even philosophies in this gamification: Which game mechanics can you play. And why? Because What is One and what is Many.


**The Wisdom**: The progression through the tiers represents not failure but the natural evolution of conflict resolution when simpler methods prove insufficient. Each tier serves a necessary function in the overall architecture of human civilization, providing different ways to dominate others while maintaining that it was "right" or "with rights."

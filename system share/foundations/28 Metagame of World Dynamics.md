## The Nesting Avenue
*Nesting Nesting Nesting. Developers Developers Developers.* -- Profusely Sweating.

You want some "fruit"/leverage of what some Tower of Power has?
Well, there are 'trade-offs' or 'consequences', one such consequences could be this: You MUST play the MoWD.
What rules does 'a Sovereign' impose in all the nestings of his Reign or Triad.
We may add this symbol: âš” as a routing designation of nesting within this Triad causes a condition of having to play MoWD to win and lose 'things' or 'land' or 'tabooed realities like persons' (Again, remember higher-order consent. All is fixated upon the subjective person and the trade-off between opportunities of a hyper rich world of opportunities. To board a vessel and endure the abrasive waves and the captains command -- But able to disembark the ship at any whim of will. I.e. Your consent to any particular is denied, your consent in being part of that totality or dominum (domination actuality) is Sacraclized and Exalted.)

When you don't share power, but only empowerment (see [Might is Right](./66.%20magic-is-right.md)), then you gain 'stability of structure and longlasting leverage' -- "peaceful means".
While the Diversity Preference and Plurality of Polymorphic Crucible offers 'alternatives to a Tower of Power as strongly as it can be had'.
Then you attain a condition in which such nesting can be used, not to dictate what should happen, but dictate that "happening must happen". That is: That the world will not fall into stasis and thus potential hopelessness for some. I.e. "Ye Shall Play -- Thou may Lose.".

## MoWD as Alternative -- The Bridge.
*The Bridge from Diplomacy and Law to Raw Might. The Ability to not be stuck in a game justified in which you lose endlessly and all-encompassing*
(As an example economic conquest of the world as the liberal capitalists brag (Whatever 'economic' means here. (With all the corruption of meaning of money and markets and 'wealth of nations')))

*MoWD as Alternative Avenue to undefined Might games and unspecified degrees of losses*

## The Nesting Avenue
*Nesting Nesting Nesting. Developers Developers Developers.* -- Profusely Sweating.

You want some "fruit"/leverage of what some Tower of Power has?
Well, there are consequences, one such consequences could be this: You MUST play the MoWD.

When you don't share power, but only empowerment (see [Might is Right](./66.%20magic-is-right.md)), then you gain 'stability of structure and longlasting leverage' -- "peaceful means".
While the Diversity Preference and Plurality of Polymorphic Crucible offers 'alternatives to a Tower of Power as strongly as it can be had'.
Then you attain a condition in which such nesting can be used, not to dictate what should happen, but dictate that "happening must happen". That is: That the world will not fall into stasis and thus potential hopelessness for some. I.e. "Ye Shall Play -- Thou may Lose.".

## MoWD as Alternative -- The Bridge.
*The Bridge from Diplomacy and Law to Raw Might. The Ability to not be stuck in a game justified in which you lose endlessly and all-encompassing*

*MoWD as Alternative Avenue to undefined Might games and unspecified degrees of losses*

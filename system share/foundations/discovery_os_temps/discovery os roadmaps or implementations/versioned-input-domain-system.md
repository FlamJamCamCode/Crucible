# Windows Versioned Input Domain System - Complete Architecture

## System Overview

A revolutionary Windows shell replacement that combines multi-user input domains with versioned, lightweight virtualization. Each user/domain runs in its own compiled system state, with Git-like versioning and instant rollback capabilities.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Foundation Layer: Explorer2.exe

**The Shell That Rules Them All**
- Replaces Windows Explorer as the primary shell
- Captures all raw input at the lowest possible level
- Manages the entire user experience and system state
- Orchestrates domains, compilation, and versioning

### 2. System Definition Language (SDL)

**Systems as Code**
```
// Base system definition
SystemBase = {
    kernel: "Windows.Kernel.v10.22000",
    drivers: ["network.sys", "storage.sys", "graphics.sys"],
    services: ["DNS", "DHCP", "WindowsUpdate"],
    registry: BaseRegistry,
    filesystem: BaseFileSystem
}

// Domain-specific systems
WorkDomain = SystemBase + {
    apps: ["Office365", "VSCode", "Chrome"],
    vpn: "CompanyVPN",
    policies: EnterprisePolicies,
    storage: WorkFileSystem,
    - features: ["Gaming", "SocialMedia"]
}

KidsDomain = SystemBase + {
    apps: ["Minecraft", "Educational"],
    policies: ParentalControls,
    storage: KidsFileSystem,
    - permissions: ["Admin", "SystemChanges"],
    time_limits: "2hrs/day"
}
```

### 3. Compilation Engine

**From Definition to Reality**

The compilation process:
1. **Parse** system definition
2. **Diff** against base system
3. **Build** isolated process tree
4. **Link** shared components
5. **Deploy** as lightweight container

**Compilation Optimizations:**
- Shared binary deduplication
- Copy-on-write memory pages
- Lazy loading of unique components
- Pre-compiled common configurations

### 4. Version Control System

**Git for Your Entire System**

```
SystemVersion {
    hash: SHA256(SystemDefinition + Timestamp)
    parent: PreviousVersion.hash
    changes: DiffFromParent
    author: "Dad"
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
    message: "Added new video editing software"
}
```

**Version Operations:**
- `checkout`: Switch to any previous state
- `branch`: Create experimental configurations
- `merge`: Combine features from different versions
- `revert`: Undo problematic changes
- `stash`: Temporarily save current state

### 5. Input Domain Router

**Connecting Users to Their Worlds**

```
InputDomain {
    id: GUID
    name: "Dad's Work"
    devices: [Keyboard1, Mouse1, Webcam1]
    displays: [Monitor1, Monitor2]
    active_version: WorkDomain_v47
    version_history: [v1...v47]
    active_mappers: [VimMapper, WorkShortcuts]
}
```

**Routing Process:**
1. Input device generates event
2. Router identifies source domain
3. Event sent to domain's active system version
4. Mappers transform based on context
5. Isolated process receives transformed input

### 6. Isolation Mechanism

**Lightweight but Secure**

Each compiled domain runs with:
- **Process Isolation**: Separate process trees
- **Memory Isolation**: Copy-on-write pages
- **Filesystem Isolation**: Layered filesystem views
- **Registry Isolation**: Virtualized registry hives
- **Network Isolation**: Virtual network adapters

**Shared Resources:**
- Read-only system files (one copy in RAM)
- Common DLLs (deduplicated)
- GPU resources (time-sliced)
- CPU cores (scheduled by domain priority)

### 7. Storage Architecture

**Layered Filesystem**

```
Layer Stack:
1. Base Windows (read-only)
2. Domain Base (copy-on-write)
3. User Data (persistent)
4. Session Data (temporary)
```

**Storage Features:**
- Instant snapshots before changes
- Deduplication across domains
- Compression for inactive versions
- Automatic garbage collection

### 8. Runtime Environment

**Living Systems**

Each domain maintains:
- Active process tree
- Memory state
- Open handles
- Network connections
- GPU contexts

**State Transitions:**
- `Suspend`: Freeze domain to disk
- `Resume`: Restore from suspension
- `Checkpoint`: Save running state
- `Migrate`: Move to different hardware

We are building an OS that "builds its own compatibility with different hardware systems".
Here is the greater problem to which it is a part:
This DiscoveryOS system will serve as a part to an "actualization layer" of computation in novel and learned orchestration.
However, within single systems the orchestration, is more varied and unpredictable. Whereas "nodes in a network offering computation" can be "ordered and structured" easily. Then each different hardware system, then and now, is more complex. And this DiscoveryOS is to function as the "software key" to making hardware useful in this larger system of computation nodes. That is, it will serve as a gateway to access hardware in efficient and "no overhead" manner, with possibility of hyper engineering micro-optimizations for run-time and deeply-discovered-hardware-combination box; and learned computational pathways within the system providing good runtimes for different tasks: Thus providing real utility as a computational unit in a very contextual sense depending on the compute task presented to it.

What I really want, is the reduction of ISA structures into "subtypes neologized words" like x86-64 being a "word" for a certain part to an ISA. Then also more words to parts of an ISA that is present in many processing units including GPUs and FGPAs and so on. But where you make new names to be able to state things like Threadripper 2930x: x86-64 + NUMA_SOMETHING_YOUNAME + StreamingSOMETHING + ... + ... And so on. That way we get a "named space" of potential ISAs to explore opcodes in when reaching a new "digital computational unit". Makes sense?

It must include any "actuating parts" (A thing in the system I can call. Any instruction at all). The architecture like NUMA is only relevant if it is "discoverable from software that knows nothing about the system apriori".

"""
1) Should the naming scheme prioritize technical accuracy (like "AVX512_VNNI") or more abstract functional names (like "NeuralSIMD_INT8")?
2) For discoverability - are you thinking only of features exposed through CPUID-like mechanisms, or also including things discoverable through performance counters, memory probing, etc.?
3) Should the taxonomy distinguish between mandatory vs optional parts of an ISA? (e.g., x86-64 always includes SSE2, but AVX is optional)
"""

1) AVX512_VNNI (But it is fine to have connotation to such things, such as being good at NeuralSIMD with float16 or whatever)
2) Any "actuating" part to a system that one could catalogue as an atomic or fundamental unit of manifesting a thing in reality. Actualization. Actuators.
3) Yes distinguish. Think dropping all legacy naming and doing Atomic naming. "These things always bundle together and come as a unit of actuators".

Also discover all other peripherial computational units within a system (only accessible through that CPU or whatever). Like GPU FGPA or "novel computational units", that may be "run by loading data on bus and a transformer/code-block/instruction"

Don't go into generic names that provide me little information about which ISA or actuators are there. Don't Say: "GPUKERNEL or GPUWARP32". These do not at all make the particular Intel or AMD or nVidia card and their ISA or "actuating interface" clear and nicely and "unit bundled" (atomic hoping).

Don't use things like generations of hardware and things like that.
The point is bundling actual opcodes that has a function of operation done on any actualizing unit - including computational units - like a GPU or FGPA and so on.
Then list all of these for yourself, and in case you don't know what they are, be honest instead of solving another problem I didn't ask you to.
With that list in mind build "units of actuators" that bundle together and which we may consider "atomic parts that a system may have or not".

Note that FGPAs are a sort of meta-opcodes or opcode-generating-opcodes. You use opcodes to make an opcode landscape of actualization or actuators.
Crucially these must be viewed as distinct as any other opcode as their function is or actuation isn't the same across different FGPA gate-setup instantiations.

We really don't care about their drivers nor programming interfaces. We are discovering raw computational "avenues" or actuators within a system we have access.
So only this one:
* Hardware ISAs (NVIDIA SASS per architecture, AMD RDNA bytecode)
The others are simply syntactic sugar, often for a subset of the hardware ISAs.

"""AMD's open approach benefits open source communities through published GPU instruction sets, open source drivers, and transparent documentation. 
The report contrasts this with NVIDIA's proprietary strategy, examining differences in driver architecture, firmware policies, developer tools, and Linux ecosystem integration."""
This provides a baseline the first time we encounter such units where we will not even have to "fuzz and find it all, but having nice entry points of what to expect and look up". But the OS is made to discover and remember across OSes these actuator packages, then try them and map out "actuators" of a system. Documentation is only nice in an initial sense, or apriori to the discovery process ever having happened.

Which may be helped generated by AI and bundled into the initial OS Actuator Atlas. 
As an example it may have been generated by asking a nicely primed AI: "Do an initial neologized naming of "actuators" available when having an AMD GPU and having an nVidia GPU of some modern ones. Say RX 5700 and RTX 3090. And be honest about simply not knowing about many or any, which lands us at a point of the hardware not being very useful to us. Write it in raw list form and with corresponding opcodes, not only human readable assembly names."

One method in finding such actuators on a system that one could consider as fundamental to Discovery OS would be:
1) One could simply try different permutations of 1's and 0's until an operation is had on the GPU.
2) One could load up GPU proprietary drivers they have released and sniff at OS level instructions sent to it when touching the abstraction interface (like PTX or CUDA). Thereby understanding what patterns have function through your driver. Then use (1) method for things not included in your driver package. Like enterprise only functions and so on.
3) Ad-hoc or apriori Reverse engineering of drivers and discovering of what it reduces to.

1. System is booted up. It runs a new OS that we simply call "Discovery OS" for now. It is tasked with discovering the system it is on. Figuring out what actualization (opening a door by spiking a port arduino similar things) or computation (like GPU) can be had. You must assume no software installed. Only discovery, but it may "remember" similar systems and be smart about discovery, like a neologized naming of ISAs that it tries out one from each, and if one hits does verification of entire atom or unit of opcodes relating to the package it tried. After that, it may try fuzzing for novel pathways and if it finds it, it may name them for another time. (Which makes nVidia GPU instruction set finding merely a naming of some computational potentials of systems: its standard task)

2. "By making a word, something happens" that is spell casting. So say any normal opcode is a spell. But it may also be things like spiking high voltage on a port on the system which causes something to happen. And so on.

3. Yes. It ought to discover such initialization processes too. But of course, we don't have to go from totally blind. We can "guide the process to having learnt those standard UEFI/BIOS methods or settings" then it can fuzz for alternatives and learn those also.

I need to stress, that the point of doing the neologized actuator-based decomposition, isn't inherent, but perhaps useful.
Why? Because the actuator discovery is specific and fine grained in a system. But having names at higher level provides human capacity to understand, and nice initial clusters to explore. What is "usually" an atomic package or "unit": a list of actuators that expectedly bundle together. Such that we can test in smart ways when entering a new system, first broad, then within each "existence of actuator suggest this bundle/atomic-package/unit" to map out comprehensively all those that are there or not. If upset, then this is learning that it wasn't atomic, but need further decomposition or branching of testing in the future. It is a learning space. Or landscape.

Some relevant context for both apriori actuator mapping. It is some historical viewpoints of trying to "fuzz by human inguity" hardware function.
And perhaps potential hints at automated processes or fuzzing of opcode space or more broadly (perhaps) "actuators".

# NVIDIA GPU driver reverse engineering uncovered

The reverse engineering of NVIDIA GPU drivers represents one of the most extensive hardware analysis efforts in computing history, revealing critical technical details about GPU operations that enable optimization opportunities far beyond official documentation. This research synthesizes findings from multiple reverse engineering projects, academic papers, and open-source initiatives that have systematically decoded NVIDIA's proprietary driver architecture.

## IDA Pro disassembly reveals driver internals

The **Driver Buddy Reloaded** plugin for IDA Pro has become the standard tool for analyzing NVIDIA's Windows kernel drivers. This Python-based plugin automatically identifies DispatchDeviceControl routines and decodes IOCTL codes, enabling researchers to trace the path from user-mode API calls to hardware operations. For Windows systems, analysts focus on **nvlddmkm.sys** (the display driver kernel component) and **nvapi64.dll** (user-mode API library), while Linux researchers target **nvidia.ko** and **libcuda.so**.

Through systematic IDA Pro analysis, researchers have mapped critical driver functions including GPU memory management routines, command submission interfaces, and power management functions. The discovery of obfuscation techniques like control flow complexity and string encryption has led to the development of specialized analysis approaches, including dynamic runtime tracing and symbolic execution to bypass static protections.

## Nouveau project documents comprehensive hardware architecture

The Nouveau project's clean-room reverse engineering effort spans **25+ years of NVIDIA GPU evolution**, from the NV1 (1995) through modern Ada Lovelace architectures. Their **envytools** framework provides the most comprehensive toolkit for GPU analysis, featuring **envydis** for disassembling GPU instruction sets, **rnndb** containing XML databases of MMIO registers, and **nvbios** for decoding VBIOS structures.

Through systematic analysis using **REnouveau** (which captures MMIO register changes during OpenGL operations) and **MmioTrace** (kernel-level I/O tracing), Nouveau developers have documented complete GPU architectures including memory controllers, command submission engines (PFIFO), graphics/compute engines (PGRAPH), and specialized processors like FALCON microcontrollers. A major breakthrough came in 2024 with **GSP (GPU System Processor) firmware support**, enabling automatic reclocking on Turing+ GPUs and reducing the reverse engineering burden for newer architectures.

## Driver functions map directly to GPU hardware operations

Research has revealed precise mappings between driver API calls and hardware operations. The **DocumentSASS** project discovered that NVIDIA's own nvdisasm tool contains embedded SASS instruction descriptions and latencies, enabling extraction of scheduling information used internally by compilers. Projects like **CuAssembler** bridge the gap between PTX virtual instructions and actual machine code, providing control over register allocation, stall cycles, and memory instruction scheduling.

Key mappings discovered include **cudaMalloc** translating to GPU memory allocator operations with specific alignment requirements, **cuLaunchKernel** programming command buffers in ring buffer format, and memory barriers inserting hardware fence instructions. The driver manages state through context switching between kernels, virtual memory address translation, and hardware queue management for kernel launches.

## SASS instructions and GPU opcodes decoded through systematic analysis

The **nv_isa_solver** project uses automated fuzzing of nvdisasm to generate instruction set specifications for modern architectures including SM90a (Hopper) and SM89 (RTX 4090). Researchers have discovered that instructions use a **128-bit encoding format** containing embedded control codes for pipeline stall management, dependency barriers for memory operations, and register bank conflict avoidance mechanisms.

Specific instruction categories uncovered include memory operations (LDG for global loads with cache policies, STS/LDS for shared memory), compute instructions (FFMA for fused multiply-add, IMAD for integer operations), and control flow (CALL.REL for relative function calls, predicated execution). The discovery that **fixed-latency instructions encode stall cycles directly** in the instruction format has enabled precise performance optimization.

## Advanced reverse engineering tools enable deep hardware analysis

Beyond IDA Pro, researchers employ **Ghidra** with custom NVIDIA Falcon processor support and Sleigh language specifications for GPU architectures. The **envytools** suite provides GPU-specific analysis capabilities unavailable in general-purpose tools. For obfuscated code, techniques include dynamic analysis to bypass static protections, memory dumps during runtime execution, and hardware-assisted debugging through JTAG interfaces.

Community-developed tools like **MaxAs** (achieving 80% opcode coverage for Maxwell GPUs) and **AsFermi** (providing direct hardware access without PTX compilation) demonstrate the depth of reverse engineering achievements. These tools enable register banking optimizations, automatic bank conflict avoidance, and direct manipulation of hardware control codes.

## Academic research correlates driver code with hardware functionality

A groundbreaking 2025 paper from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya titled **"Analyzing Modern NVIDIA GPU cores"** achieved unprecedented accuracy in reverse engineering modern GPU microarchitecture. The research revealed how GPUs leverage compiler-guided hardware execution, discovered issue logic policies and register file structures, and achieved just **13.98% mean absolute percentage error** compared to real RTX A6000 hardware.

Security researchers have exposed fundamental architectural details through papers like **"TunneLs for Bootlegging"** (CCS 2023), which reverse-engineered GPU TLBs for Turing and Ampere generations and discovered that NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU feature doesn't partition the last-level TLB, enabling covert channels. The **"Dissecting the NVIDIA Volta/Turing GPU Architecture"** series used systematic microbenchmarking to reveal memory hierarchy structures, cache systems, and throughput characteristics previously unknown outside NVIDIA.

## Hardware discoveries reveal sophisticated GPU architecture

Reverse engineering has uncovered the complete memory hierarchy architecture including L1 cache sizes (32KB-128KB per SM), shared L2 caches up to 6MB, and specialized constant/texture caches. The streaming multiprocessor structure has been decoded, revealing CUDA cores organized in warps of 32, special function units for transcendental operations, tensor cores for matrix operations, and dedicated load/store units.

The discovery of **warp schedulers with multiple execution pipelines**, scoreboard dependency tracking, and dynamic register allocation explains GPU performance characteristics. DMA engine analysis revealed sophisticated copy engines separate from compute units, peer-to-peer NVLink transfers, and GPUDirect technology enabling **13.3 GB/s bandwidth** for direct storage-to-GPU transfers.

These reverse engineering efforts have produced functional open-source drivers, enabled security vulnerability discovery, and provided optimization insights impossible through official channels alone. The recent hiring of longtime Nouveau maintainer Ben Skeggs by NVIDIA in 2024 signals potential changes in NVIDIA's approach to open-source collaboration, while continued research pushes the boundaries of understanding these complex architectures.
"""

And some inb4s misunderstanding fixing:
"""
The neologized names aren't the goal; they're the scaffolding for intelligent exploration.
"""

"""
- AVX512_VNNI isn't just a name - it's a hypothesis that "if VPDPBUSD exists, then VPDPBUSDS, VPDPWSSD, etc. should also exist"
- When we find MATRIX_MULTIPLY_INT8, we hypothesize a whole family of related operations at different precisions
- These bundles encode our accumulated knowledge about hardware design patterns
"""

"""
- Each system that violates expectations teaches us about hardware diversity
- "Atomic" units that frequently split suggest branch-naming because it was not atomic but an over-generalization
- New patterns emerge from analyzing violations across many systems
- The Discovery OS becomes smarter with each new architecture explored (And offline version compressed dataset larger. Though we hope to be smart about this too. And networked versions that search only for networking minimal discovery dataset to expedite that part, then with network access to expidition dataset of rest of potential hardware.)
"""

"""
This is the radical minimalism of Discovery OS - it's essentially a self-constructing operating system that contains only:
Core Discovery Engine:

- Minimal boot stub (just enough to start probing)
- Discovery algorithms and safety frameworks
- Learning/pattern matching logic
- Actuator composition engine

Discovered Reality:

- Only the actuators that actually exist on THIS system
- No drivers for hardware you don't have
- No abstraction layers for capabilities that aren't present
- No legacy compatibility for things that aren't there

The boot process becomes:
1. Minimal trial-n-error search of such things as BIOS/UEFI handoff (It starts or it doesn't. Only thing we need to ensure is restart until functionality.) → "Other Hardware Discovery" kernel bootstrapped can start
2. Begin actuator discovery → "What can this system do?"
3. Build custom Actuator image that essentially is what is loaded like an old OS would be → Only code paths for present actuators
4. A Logic to Machine Atlas mapping process (Will not be specified now)
5. System ready → Perfectly fitted to THIS hardware
"""

"""
Systems that manage to be undiscoverable for Discovery OS, are for all intents and purposes useless hardware, not worth a dime, as they have no utility to provide other than drain power in its idle mode.
Thus if Discovery OS ecosystem grows as an alternative running OS layer of computers and IoT around the world. Then their hardware simply is outside value in all value provided by this system of computation.

Therefore, I like to consider "anti-reverse-engineering" is mostly hurting themselves. If they manage to beat it, they've made themselves useless for efficient and mimimal DiscoveryOS type compute ecosystems.

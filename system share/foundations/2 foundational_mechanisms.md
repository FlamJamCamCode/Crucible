# 2. Foundational Mechanisms

## The Building Blocks of Will Manifestation

### Proof of Person (PoP)

**Purpose**: Establish that pseudonyms represent real humans without revealing identity.

**Core Mechanism**:
- Real people witness other real people in physical space
- Witnesses testify to personhood, not identity  
- Testimony accumulates into "network-strength-of-existence"
- Pseudonyms become bound to persons facing real consequences

**Implementation Examples**:
- AR rhythm games requiring physical presence
- Shared meals with witness confirmation
- Collaborative physical tasks
- Any activity hard to fake without being there

**Key Properties**:
- **Sybil resistant**: Can't create unlimited fake identities
- **Privacy preserving**: Personhood without identification
- **Socially grounded**: Requires actual human interaction
- **Reputation persistent**: Bad actors can't just create new identities

### Proof of Utility (PoU)

**Purpose**: Ensure all value claims are validated by real humans with reputation at stake.

**Core Mechanism**:
1. Provider claims to deliver utility
2. Real person (with PoP) requests utility  
3. Utility is provided (or not)
4. **Real person confirms or denies delivery**
5. This confirmation becomes blockchain mining mechanism
6. Trust scores update based on patterns

**Revolutionary Insight**: This is THE mechanism preventing gaming. Every utility must be confirmed by someone risking their reputation.

**Trust Map Divergence**:
- Your trust scores differ from mine
- Disagreements about utility cause divergence
- Natural clustering of compatible value systems
- Civilizations emerge from systematic disagreements

### Trust Networks as Information Conduits

**Beyond Filtering**: Trust networks don't just filter bad actors - they create collective intelligence through information flow.

**Information Benefits**:
- **Shared discoveries**: One finds great provider, all learn
- **Collective learning**: Network wisdom accumulates
- **Desire visibility**: Learn what others actually want
- **Pathway optimization**: Successful routes spread
- **Will coalescence**: Compatible gatherings flow through trust
- **Economic opportunities**: Valuable chances reach right people

**Trust Varieties**:
- **Trust to deliver**: Basic utility provision
- **Trust to not look**: Access data without examining
- **Trust to forget**: Delete patterns after use
- **Trust to secure**: Protect from other parties
- **Trust to optimize**: Good-faith improvements
- **Trust to respect**: Honor stated boundaries

**Overhead Elimination**:
Traditional systems require:
- Heavy regulation and compliance
- Cryptographic verification overhead
- Constant surveillance systems
- Complex legal frameworks
- Enforcement bureaucracies

Trust enables:
- Skip regulation with trusted providers
- Direct data sharing without encryption
- Rich predictions without privacy loss
- Spot-checking replacing surveillance
- Social guarantees replacing technical ones

### The PoP-PoU Dynamic

**Pretext**
In blockchain technology, you try to implement anonymous/pseudomous systems with "democratic" control, which they then call: Trustless.
That is, there isn't one person who can control it, but rather it is controlled by "decentralizing systems" or "democratic" systems.
Usually it takes the form of Proof of Work, which is setting up a "voting mechanism" that is dependent on some 'work' that can't be 'faked completed' but requires 'investment'. They then further try to ensure, that the machinery useful in computing this 'work' is the already distributed machinery upon the masses, with no Application Specific Integrated Chips (ASIC) capable of doing it 'much better'.

There are other variants, one is capital control: Proof of Stake. Then voting in the system is weighted upon the amount of currency you have put into 'voting stake locked wallets'.

This system proposes another way to achieve this decentralized 'voting mechanism' in a system. By creating a person-to-person Proof-of-Person strengthening by 'network effects', (Dealt with later: in a subjective belief consequential manner)

Dangerous comment, because easily misunderstood, so forget for now: This has the effect, that for "all intents and purposes" you can use a pseudonym or address in the system, without any connection other than the 'transitivity property' of someone well-established in the system.

Proof-of-person is achieved by humans intermingling and establishing strength of pseudonyms as a human bound one.
This is similar to how Proof of Work would mine and provide 'share of vote' or 'weight of vote' in the system's "collective truth/domination mechanism".

That is to say, that in the non-subjective variety, then being a "diverse network intermingler" is the optimal "mining" of 'weight of vote' in the system.

This then becomes an "inverted pyramid" intelligence-substrate/system upon which one can "realize" universal suffrage or voting systems from; as well as being able to with viscosity deal with persons and cut through all abstraction and covers, gain accountability and responsibility. As well as understanding chains of causality, past and future, with respect to products and persons. The systems further empower privacy in ways unavailable in any prior systems or societies.

Furthermore, the PoP mechanism is amplified by LiveLifeLocally AugmentedReality games, that has many great potentials, so long as one can manage to do it on consentual "potential power relation" terms. This requires both plurality of suppliers and actual visible Trust relations, not to companies, but to PoP suppliers.
As well as managing to build Trustless infrastructure alternatives whenever possible, with whatever economic overhead it may have.
It is important to note, that the economic overhead of most Trustless non-privacy aspects becomes almost zero, with PoP instead of PoW or PoS.

There is no point in further explaining aspects here, but with enough effort, these documents outline a future for the world, where Will of Man is placed above and the world is brought into its unleashed chaos tamed into **harmonious order** by these systems, able to act on *unleashed authentic human will in its entire scope of desire*. If nothing else, then surely you will find that even sporadic readings of setions in these documents are a great fountain of inspiration.

The opposite system is also implemented "the pyramid" and its manifestation is called The Polymorphic Crucible, where the "melting of the metals" is had through the "inverted pyramid" and "Might is Right" (Also, known as Cause & Effect from human will is given moral foundation and justification, sufficient to not simply being taken, because "they could", but rather that with what you do, "cause and effect", you are justified in it. It becomes a dance of 'the many coming together in what cause and effect they can' and 'the few and the cause and effect they can' having Might With Right against any and all and in-between. If you discard because of naughty by now, then we are lucky to get rid of you so early.). Together they become a "skyreflected fractal pyramid" (SRFP) attempting to become a "skyreflected pyramid" (dense fractality), its cross section is a "fractal cross (if 4-ary fractal tree) or (n-ary fractal tree)cross-section" (a "zoom and with detail view" of its manifestation), and it's 2d profile projection is an hourglass or disentangle 6 pointed star, or its logographic symbolism is the X.

Man Unleashed, Set Fully Free, but offered a systematic way to maximize the manifestational powers of any and many, while having the sufficient harsh real cause and effect feedback mechanisms and intelligence systems and cooperation and more sufficient to "tame it all" despite of man fully free.

Fully Free. While this is the case, and the system is entire amoral, I have throughout the documents, tried to argue and opinionate as Nesting of Order within the system or below the system, inside "Triads" or "Variants" or "Mutations" or "Ores". An example of that, is to clearly distinguish and separate from, those that either fail to live by it (morality) or disagree with it in principle (ethics) or is very likely to one day fail living by it (ethnos); where the "it" here is The Minimal Benevolence Codex (MBC).

Which is to state, that no one gets to kill/"bring about death"/"refuse to take reasonable steps to avoid death", severely torture or bring about suffering, nor imprison without also finding a patch of soil, where the prisoner can be left alone or with others who want to be with that person. These three rules I suggest as the Planetary Triad rules at some point. Initially, there will be a segmentation on those lines: The New World, The Old World, and The World of Death. The latter is the one's who fail to abide by the MBC.

The reason, why "The Golden Rule" or "Categorical Imperative" is applied in some approximate way on these three topics, is that they are the "grievance catalyzer" (escalation) and of a "permanence" in quality (unnecessarily chronic or permanent).
Instead the main mechanism of punishment is tied to this PoP and being "excluded" by the many in the inverted pyramid and pyramid structures (SRFP). Which has sometimes the same and sometimes different ways of expressing itself. In the inverted pyramid it is interactive pressure and sabotage, avoidance and more that is changed and disempowers a person in places and systems and interactions with others. In the pyramid fashion it is often simply by being banished from lands of this planet. (Fractal Pyramids are replacing governments and "territory institutions". The 'voting mechanism' can be anything, but it may use the PoP aspects for very large such systems to constantly get a flow of 'democratic will/vote' or 'particular persons will/voting'. (And yes you can do very very very accurate 1 person 1 vote with this system. But it isn't directly born with 100% security from the PoP in itself. You have to do 'LLL games' on top of it that does more identification than "decentralized strength proving". And also possibly punishment or banishment from lands if someone cheats with the votes))


Might is Right. What does it provide us with?
This scheme. We shall KNOW the Right you are and see.
You be the monster to the creatures or life on the planet you want to be.
"This monster to those beings. That kind of monster to these."

Insodoing, we shall then know what category of "these or those" we then consider you to be, and what kind of monster we are to each of them.

We're all evil in some way. We're all monsters to some creatures. Some life. But the great war that will come is who will dominate the other to simply be unable to be monsters towards which creatures. (Mosquito you are what? Your dog you are what? A puppy? A lamb? A Calf? piglet? bare fully grown pig? a kitten? an old man? Your enemy in ethics without any effect on your part of the world? a random man? the "worst" man? a random woman? the "worst" woman? and to a little girl, you are what? what about a VERY little girl barely having gotten a developing brain you are what? What about the human life containing mostly The Architect of a little girl and in the process of building her, to that you are what? (What do you know about the depths of reality. Pascal's Womb. What if I'm wrong about what we can't know for sure. What if you're wrong.) And so on.)
As well as what kind of monster the winners will be, towards those that then insist on being the disallowed monster to particular creatures.

In the end, this will be the great display and redemption of the doctrine of Might is Right.
The Might that becomes Right. That wins the cause and effect struggle of enforcing what is Right.
The Might that then Is Right.





**The Core Engine**: Real persons confirming real utility creates ungameable value verification.

**Blockchain Integration**:
- PoU confirmations become mining rewards
- Real value delivery drives consensus
- No wasted computation on arbitrary puzzles
- Economic incentives align with utility

**Natural Selection**:
- Providers claiming false utility lose trust
- Confirmers lying lose reputation
- Honest actors gain economic advantage
- System evolutionarily favors truth

### Witness-Based Key Recovery

**The Innovation**: Social recovery without losing individual sovereignty.

**Recovery Mechanism**:
1. You claim ownership of pseudonym
2. Trust network witnesses agree you're owner
3. No legitimate contestants (or only enemies)  
4. Justified hard fork grants new keys

**Network Diversity Benefits**:
- Verification across multiple "soft-disjoint" networks
- Very strong recovery justification
- Natural market for "trust wanderers"
- Cross-network vouching services

### Reputation Viscosity

**Gradient-Based**: Reputation follows proportional to trust network connectivity, not universally.

**How It Works**:
- Betray people in network A
- Create new pseudonym in network B
- Reputation bleeds based on:
  - Overlap between A and B witnesses
  - Transitive trust connections
  - Strength of PoP chains
  - Network topology distance

**Practical Result**:
- Can't escape to identical networks
- Might escape to completely different ones
- Lose access to all connected trust clusters
- Natural incentive for good behavior

### Trust as Civilizational Substrate

**Collective Intelligence Properties**:
- Information flows create network wisdom
- Successful patterns spread naturally
- Failed attempts prevent repetition
- Desire visibility enables coalescence
- The network becomes smarter than members

**Economic Revolution**:
- Every dollar not spent on defense can create value
- Trust literally makes economy more efficient
- Professional credentials become proven utility
- Markets serve all trust preferences equally

**Civilizational Divergence**:
- Groups disagreeing about utility naturally separate
- Trust maps become cultural boundaries
- Multiple value systems coexist peacefully
- Conflict transforms into topology

### Implementation Principles

**Start Small**: Begin with local trust networks before scaling.

**Prove Value**: Let utility confirmations drive adoption.

**Allow Divergence**: Don't force unified trust standards.

**Enable Discovery**: Let successful patterns emerge and spread.

**Maintain Sovereignty**: Individual control with social recovery options.

**Embrace Plurality**: Multiple implementations competing on merit.

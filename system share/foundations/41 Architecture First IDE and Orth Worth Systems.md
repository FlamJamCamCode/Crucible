# 41. Architecture First IDE and Orth/Worth/Vorth/WaterWorth Systems

## The Vision: Top-Down Development Through Language Closure

### The Fundamental Philosophy

**Architecture First Development** represents a revolutionary approach to software development that starts with the whole and progressively designs black boxes down to implementable nodes. This methodology ensures that every keystroke has maximum ramifications down the pipes, making high-level architectural decisions scale through others' implementations.

**The Core Principle**: When developing interesting systems, you must start with the whole, then progressively design black boxes of parts to the system all the way down until you reach a node that you can implement. Then you do that again and again.

### The Three-Layer Language Closure

The system implements three layers or languages to the same "language-closure":

#### 1. Orth (WebForth/WebOrth)
**Private "words" or symbols-of-meaning**

- Like Forth programming language, but much fewer definitions out of the box
- Much more "general" or unopinionated in relation to the underlying model
- All it implements is a meta structure of generating a language when running WebAssembly interpreter
- **Orth** = "Ord" (Danish: Word, English: Order shorthand)
- Removes the "F" from Forth (The Fail shorthand), eliminating opinionated mental model requirements
- **Private Language**: Your personal symbols-of-meaning, not shared

#### 2. Worth (WebWord/WebWorth)
**Shared or "sufficiently convergent with 'others' to allow for agreed upon semantics"**

- Decentralized library where convergence of clusters of mapping [TOKEN-NAME] to [TOKEN-CODE] happens
- Write code "[TOKEN-NAME_142] [TOKEN-NAME_642]" and have "Your Web" Wide understanding of the Word
- Accept semantics of names and syntax in relation to a "web" you subscribe to
- **Token Format**: Code stored in token-format (unique identifying ids) directly one-to-one mapped in library file
- **Editor Integration**: Can easily substitute unique identifying numbers with correct words from library
- **Shared Language**: Convergent semantics with others in your web

#### 3. WaterWorth (WebWater/.o files)
**Application-specific bit-stream compressed format**

- Like WebWord, but bit-stream compressed with application-specific compression schematics
- **Compression File**: .wwes file (WebWaterEncodingScheme) separate from .ww file
- **Variable Bit-Level Encoding**: Designates correct token (token id) and semantic through WebWord library
- **Application-Level**: WebWord tokenization applied not in "your Web" but Application level with compression intent
- **Communication Handshake**: Store independent of data transfer for optimal data transfer potential
- **Dream State**: Share entire video games or massive movies in a few kilobytes

### The Architecture First IDE

#### Top-Down Development Strategy

**The Process**:
1. **Start with the Whole**: Begin with the name of the game (Jord or Sol)
2. **Define Parts**: Progressively break down into components
3. **Black Box Design**: Create open black boxes that others can implement
4. **Maximum Ramifications**: Every keystroke has maximum impact down the pipes
5. **Wide Utility**: Big picture stuff has wide utility and general application

**Example from Jord**:
```
: Jord Loop TimeElapsedRun 1ms IODigest IOQueue Physics TimeElapsedRun 4ms OutputMode OutputDevice
```

**The Evolution**:
- **Bad Version**: `: Jord Loop IOQueue Physics TimeElapsedRun 4ms OutputMode OutputDevice`
- **Problem**: Allows IO to be calculated in every loop iteration
- **Solution**: IO interrupt protection prevents external systems from hijacking
- **TimeElapsedRun 1ms**: Ignores next verb and nouns if hasn't elapsed 1ms or more
- **IODigest**: "Verb" on "noun" IOQueue, eats most recent or latest 10 IO signals

#### Forth-Like Natural Development

**Why Forth-Like Languages Work**:
- Natural hierarchical or zoom view inherent in the code
- Reveals all design choices made with natural language view
- Progressive definition of words until you've solved it
- **Magic Words**: High-level words that manifest with latency of actual realization

**The Bootstrapping Problem**:
- **Imagine Having Made Orth**: The meta-language system exists
- **Code in Worth**: Write high-level specifications in Worth language
- **Someone Provides .vorth Files**: Others implement the actual Worth words
- **No Word Definitions**: Simply write words, no need to define what they do
- **Space for Everything**: Use spacing as the primary glue mechanism

### The Sol Architecture Example

#### The Sol System Design

```
@Sol {
    Aiddaemon ->    Attention   -- Enquery 
        |             ||
    Viewport  <=>   SolState    - UserIO <-- Aiddaemon
                       |
                    Aiddaemon
}
```

**Core Components**:
- **Aiddaemon**: Personal AI mirror that learns your daemon and acts AS YOU would act
- **Attention**: Broadcast what information you want, receive filtered information
- **Viewport**: Discover user eye focus, display relevant content
- **SolState**: Your personal view of the world state, sharded and personalized
- **UserIO**: Adaptive input modes optimized by Aiddaemon

#### Genetic Variants and Intelligence

**The Genetic Variant Approach**:
- Simple logic that makes "knowing what to do in seemingly intelligent fashion" efficient
- Careful use of very few variables a system may have to alter by projection
- **Example**: Adding a semaphore to a train junction with detector makes rails seem intelligent
- **Aiddaemonic Projection**: Project "state" into semaphore with Subaiddaemon wrapped detectors

**Intelligence Through Simplicity**:
- Very intelligent and attuned human system constantly works to change dumb systems
- Change dumb systems to function in different but still dumb or simple ways
- **Result**: Whole system seems incredibly adaptive and intelligent
- **Scalability**: Even wire, relay, or multiplexor can be wrapped in Subaiddaemonic projective space

#### The Three-Layer Pattern

**Architecture Space**: Human comprehensible design decisions
**Logic Space**: Human intelligible simulation and will-topology elucidation
**Machine Space**: Triggering real world actuation

**Will-Coalescence Integration**:
- **Intent/Will**: Architecture layer
- **Logic**: Simulation space (will-topology elucidation and will-economics)
- **Machine**: "Having them do it" - actual realization

### The WaterWorth Compression Revolution

#### Optimal Data Transfer

**The Vision**:
- Share entire video games or massive movies in a few kilobytes
- **WebWater Framework**: Optimal data-communication + application specification
- **Prepositional vs Predicative**: Made prepositionally instead of predicatively because of Forth model
- **Diff Against Knowledge**: Find optimal path of making you understand through modulations of words you already have

#### Cross-File Compression

**The Innovation**:
- Data store that is "compressed across all files"
- **Movie Store Example**: Provide vorth that uses movies between each other to store themselves
- **Generating Function vs Series**: Code allows "generation" as well, making it FAR more compressing
- **Human Conceptualizations**: Per human conceptualizations and how they describe other parts or differences

#### The .o File System

**Essential Data Only**:
- .o files have no information but the essential
- **Consumer Needs**: Handshake of which vorth or none, and which webwater-variability encoding scheme
- **Encoding Scheme**: Specified in orth, designated with .eo files
- **Bit-Level Designation**: Like (0b1nknk + 0b01nknknk + 0b001nknk...)

### The Orth Editor System

#### WebWater Editor

**Structure Preservation**:
- WebWater is entirely structure preserving
- **Editor Function**: Merely applies decompression (cutting data at bit-junctions instead of "cpu word" junctions)
- **CPU Instruction Cost**: Minimal overhead for reading and writing files
- **Tokenization**: Takes WebWater format and tokenizes into words that each bit-segment encodes

#### File Format Integration

**Universal Editor**:
- Always shows WebWord code regardless of underlying format
- **WebWater Files**: Automatically compresses into WebWater when saving, decompresses when loading
- **Same Code**: Code is identical, only encoding scheme differs
- **String vs Binary**: Use string "" to designate word or 0bkkkkkkkkkkkkkk to designate word

#### Browser Integration

**HTML to WebWater Conversion**:
- Convert HTML file format into .o format for website communication
- **Visual Bootstrapping**: Bootstrap all logic and data store as orth derivative content
- **Browser Hooks**: Need hooks into browser actuating parts (graphics card, display driver, keyboard IO)
- **WebAssembly Foundation**: Serve .wat file to bootstrap orth in webassembly

### The Game Master Implementation Strategy

#### Racing Game Philosophy

**You Define Architecture** = Others race to implement your specifications
**Don't Like It?** = Play another game! You control the meta-game
**Maximum Value** = Your work scales through others' implementations
**Natural Selection** = Best implementers win, but you control the rules

#### Top-Down Value Maximization

**The Strategy**:
- **High-Level Architecture** = Wide utility and general application
- **Nitty Gritty Details** = Lower utility, too specific to apply to very many
- **Maximum Ramifications** = Every keystroke has maximum impact down the pipes
- **Magic Words** = High-level words that manifest with latency of actual realization

**The Bootstrap Solution**:
- **Imagine Having Made Orth**: The meta-language system exists
- **Code in Worth**: Write high-level specifications
- **Someone Provides .vorth Files**: Others implement the actual Worth words
- **Sufficient Implementation**: Complete the bootstrap by providing implementations

### The WebAssembly Foundation

#### Universal Implementation

**Why WebAssembly**:
- **Ubiquitous Access**: Only implementation that can reach every person on the planet
- **WebBrowser Integration**: Only ubiquitously implemented scheme
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across many systems without further implementations
- **Embedded Device Support**: Offload exoticism onto non-embedded compute substrate

#### Bootstrap Implementation

**orth.wat**:
- Implementation of Orth in webassembly
- **Bootstrap Function**: Allows writing orth code embedded in webassembly structuring
- **Transparent Execution**: Makes orth code executable as .wat code without anyone noticing
- **Embedded Orth**: Orth code embedded in webassembly without detection

### The Complete System Integration

**Architecture First IDE** represents the convergence of:

1. **Top-Down Development**: Start with whole, design black boxes down to implementable nodes
2. **Three-Layer Language Closure**: Orth (private) → Worth (shared) → WaterWorth (compressed)
3. **Forth-Like Natural Development**: Hierarchical, progressive definition approach
4. **Genetic Variants**: Simple logic for intelligent behavior through projection
5. **WebAssembly Foundation**: Universal implementation across all systems
6. **Game Master Strategy**: Define architecture, let others race to implement
7. **Compression Revolution**: Optimal data transfer through cross-file compression
8. **Browser Integration**: HTML to WebWater conversion for universal web access

### The Ultimate Goal

**Architecture First IDE** is not just a development environment—it is the infrastructure for:

- **Maximum Value Scaling**: Every architectural decision scales through others' implementations
- **Universal Access**: Reach every person on the planet through WebAssembly foundation
- **Optimal Communication**: Share massive amounts of data through compressed formats
- **Natural Development**: Hierarchical, progressive development that reveals design choices
- **Intelligence Through Simplicity**: Complex systems built from simple, intelligent components
- **Game Master Control**: Define the rules while others race to implement

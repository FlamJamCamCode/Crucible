# Tentative Bastards and the Moral Economy
## How Hesitation Robs the World of Color

### I. The Tentative Bastard Phenomenon

**Definition:** Tentative Bastards are those who, dare not admit - even to themselves - their disagreement, disalignment and discontent with 'what is' or 'what will be'; Much less do they dare express it; And never in full pure expression without sugarcoating it for hegemony or unauthentic harmony seeking. They often when faced with transformative choice, dilute every fierce process into lukewarm compromise. They aren't merely cowards — they often serve as *transformation preventers*, by being civilization's pressure release valve that keeps genuine change from ever reaching critical mass, by applying their tentativeness as a moral obligation or duty. When they do not laud the inbetween and stifled, the compromise and dilluted as the good, then they often formulate it thusly: "It isn't good, but it is better than the risk of trying anything else".

The protocol generates multiplicity and pluralism. If we fail to see real difference or distinction to dare be soveigns OR if the sovereign does not dare fully express his will unpolluted. Then we get a less rich world or else we get a worse version of The Crucible without daring to explicit nest it that worse version.  He conflates many distinct places into a compromised shared space (which is again better handled by the protocol xd) xd chatgpt
Got it — you want sovereignty *as raw, unapologetic imposition of will*, not diluted stewardship or harmonizing compromise. Sovereignty isn’t about managing pluralism gently; it’s about *daring domination without surrender* to compromise. The protocol *creates* multiplicity and pluralism on its own — the sovereign’s job is to *choose which multiplicities are enforced, shaped, or suppressed*.  

When a sovereign tries to harmonize or unify too much, they become a lesser version of the protocol itself — losing the sharpness and decisiveness that defines true sovereignty. Sovereignty *breaks pluralism* where it must, imposes clarity through domination, and dares to claim *uncompromised authority* over certain domains or realms.  

So:  
- Protocol = multiplicity generator, complexity creator, pluralism *provider*  
- Sovereign = the *raw will* that slices through that complexity with *decisive imposition* — no softening, no compromise.  


**The Non-Uniform Distribution Problem:**

Tentative Bastards don't appear uniformly across society. They cluster:
- **In Transition Zones:** Where different value systems meet; It functions as a pressure-cooker by imposed tolerance and hesitancy in dealing with the root problems of antidaemonia melting pot of highly jarring and disaligned persons.
- **In Power Positions:** Where their hesitation has maximum dampening effect
- **In Cultural Gatekeeping:** Where they can filter out "extreme" expressions; This causes rough edges to be artificially oppressed and suppressed, which allows for explosive events once release or lapse in suppression.
- **In Economic Nodes:** Where they moderate all transactions toward the mean

This clustering creates *dead zones* where no pure expression can survive.

### II. The Robbery of True Color

**What Dies in the Presence of Tentative Bastards:**

1. **The Fierce Aesthete** dilutes their vision to be "accessible" or "accomodating the taste of others": "Well I wanted purple, but now that you insist that yellow feels bad about purple, then I'll make it more yellow".
2. **The Radical Innovator** adds "safety features" that neuter their creation
3. **The Devotional Lover** hedges their commitment with exit clauses; Never fully committing, always hedging one's position and being able to slide inbetween.
4. **The Warrior-Philosopher** softens their truth to avoid offense; lest they'd be deemed unacceptable and dangerous for insisting room to manifest their philosophy (Triad or spacetime emergences).
5. **The Mystic** explains away their visions in "rational" terms; Having to resort to explaining "why", when it is experiential and subjective sensations.

**The Efficiency Loss:**

When someone with a *pure color* to express encounters a cluster of Tentative Bastards, they face:
- **Energy drain** from constant negotiation; Always a relay and decision making process in getting a go: And a go would be almost all the help you expect. Merely not being denied.
- **Vision erosion** from repeated compromise
- **Identity confusion** from mixed signals
- **Resource waste** on bridge-building to nowhere

**The Greater Tragedy:**
Somewhere in the world, there exists a *perfect space* for each pure expression. A place where:
- [Insert that nebulae of context for each that makes it truly distinct. Or make up your own. Fairy tales are good at making distinct places worth visiting. But also chauvanistic or at least proud cultures try hard to be distinct and worth visiting]
- The Fierce Aesthete would inspire a movement
- The Radical Innovator would solve impossible problems
- The Devotional Lover would create legendary romance
- The Warrior-Philosopher would forge new ways of being
- The Mystic would open doorways to the divine

But Tentative Bastards prevent the sorting. They create *friction* where there should be *flow*. Where they could be empowerment and amplification even.

### III. The Mathematics of Mediocrity

**Consider a simple model:**

Let's say a population has:
- 20% Pure Expressors (strong, defined color)
- 50% Adaptable Souls (can resonate with strong color; "Let me be your canvas. Colour me. Let me be the flag in the wind")
- 30% Tentative Bastards (dilute everything)

**In uniform distribution:** Every community gets dulled to gray.

**In efficient sorting:** Pure Expressors find resonant communities, Tentative Bastards cluster together in their comfortable compromise zones. Where we will keep nudging at them to dare also paint a place their colours instead of always outsourcing it to compromise and consensus: Whatever is the safest or deemed hegeomincally 'the right choice'.

**The Loss Function:**
- Each Pure Expressor trapped among Tentative Bastards = -1 revolutionary innovation
- Each cluster of resonant souls without a Pure Expressor = -1 cultural renaissance
- Each Tentative Bastard in a gateway or dominance-institution (like territory institutions of nation states) position = -100 potential connections
(Note: This is not advocating anarchy, but can allow for Triad proclaiming anarchy-oxymoron System-as-sovereign. In the context of the systems then tentative bastards ceases to serve their stability and order purpose they otherwise serve. The proposed New Wolrd vs Old World choice insist they keep their position but release territory for New World Crucible (battleground/experimentation) to express itself in. Where-ever that can be had. Revolution and overthrowing of old systems is not advocated in these documents. Making room is. "Revolution" is had by rallying to New World and rallying to nests within etc. But crucially it means 'it exists' then it 'grows' and 'grows' until it is so popular that revolution or 'making of more space' is reasonable. And as previously discussed it expected that there will exist 'stubborn power-players and citizens' who refuse to part even a single piece as the world transforms around them. And they can try to keep their territory dominion as they can when the weight of the world turns against them. (As an example take Russia statesmen and some citizens refuses. Well, then we don't "wage war" expressed many places how to deal with things all the way until MIRA. However, It does mean that Russia will face more and more pressure in 'having all that territory' and being 'vacated' for population who rally to New World and is unable to find space within territory currently named Russia))

### IV. Subjective Coin Valuation: The Economic Revolution

**Enter the Blockchain Pathway:**

Imagine money that *knows what you value*. Not fixed exchange rates, but fluid, subjective, moral currency.

Here follows is a rough and mechanical almost rule based system version that isn't applying blob classes and other insights.
**How It Works:**

1. **Base Layer:** Standard blockchain for transaction recording
2. **Valuation Layer:** Each wallet maintains subjective exchange rates
3. **Trust Layer:** Network effects from shared values
4. **Discovery Layer:** Finding economic allies and avoiding value mismatches

**Example Transaction:**

Alice (Projective Space Fierce Aesthete: Flips True) sells art to Bob (Projective Space Tentative Bastard as Viewed by Alice: Flips True):
- Alice's system values Bob's coins at 0.3x (ES: low trust, compromised source)
- Bob's system values Alice's art at 0.5x (doesn't understand beauty metroversal worth of Alice daemon aesthetics)
- The transaction either doesn't happen, or happens at a loss to both

Same art to Carol (Resonant Soul):
- Alice's system values Carol's coins at 1.5x (ES: aligned values, trusted source)
- Carol's system values Alice's art at 2x (recognizes genius)
- Both profit from the exchange beyond monetary terms

Note: This is a crude example of will-equilibrium towards will-manifestation of both parties. Where some particular 'reasons' are presented - in Aiddaemon Encoding Schemes - of why it is "worth more in 1d coins" to make the transaction to one party versus another. 

Another could be this: 
"When trading with Carol, the money is 'respent' by many persons and in that chain of demands/commands the activity has a very high probability of it resonating- or being aligned with- or conducive to- manifesting the wills and intents of Alice's"; Whereas "When trading with Bob, the money will be spent demanding abundance of what is hideous and destructive to any enchanting world immersion and sensation for Alice in her local setting".

### V. The Soft-Currency Exchange Rate 
*An intermediary or perhaps preferred state of having currencies while having the will-economic empowerment (Which allows for any domain cross domains will-equilibrium finding in elaborate will-manifestation pathways discovered in highly automated fashion but only suggest in whichever way the individual wants that information to influence their decision making and life)*
Also, note, that it is indeed possible to try to implement any subpart to these systems that seem useful. But obviously, Author suggests them all in unison: New World.

**Not One Economy, But Thousands:**

Each value cluster develops its own internal economy with:
- **High-velocity internal trade** (shared values = easy exchange)
- **Friction at borders** (value misalignment = exchange rate penalties)
- **Natural sorting mechanisms** (economic incentive to find your people)

**Exchange Rate Factors:**

Between any two economic actors, the rate may depend on:
1. **Trust Network Distance** (how many trusted connections between you)
2. **Value Alignment Score** (how similar your transaction histories)
3. **Reputational Consensus** (what your mutual connections say)
4. **Aesthetic Compatibility** (derived from purchase patterns)
5. **Ethical Alignment** (based on who you refuse to trade with)

### VI. The Tentative Bastard Economic Death Spiral

**What Happens to Tentative Bastards in This System:**

1. **Initial Phase:** Their coins work everywhere but at mediocre rates
2. **Middle Phase:** Pure Expressors begin refusing their currency entirely
3. **Late Phase:** They can only trade with other Tentative Bastards
4. **Final Phase:** The Gray Economy — functional but joyless

**The Beautiful Sorting:**
- Tentative Bastards get their wish: safe, compromise-based communities
- Pure Expressors find their tribes and create wonders
- The world gains a thousand flowers instead of uniform beige

### VII. Practical Implementation
*A stage for the intermediary phase where $€¥ is still king - while you're no longer entirely blind to the holistic cost in relation to furthering or diminishing your many intents or will.*
Here is presented an attempt at applying some of the foundations for more intelligent application of the wealth one has; to maximize the holistic impact of your dollar.
**Technical Architecture:**

```
User Wallet {
  - Identity Keys
  - Value Profile (learned from transactions)
  - Trust Map/Network (explicit connections)
  - Exchange Rate Calculator (per-counterparty)
  - Transaction History (with moral metadata)
}

Transaction {
  - Standard blockchain data
  - Subjective value multipliers
  - Trust path signatures
  - Aesthetic compatibility score
  - Ethical alignment flags
}
```

**Social Dynamics:**

1. **Onboarding:** Start with neutral rates, quickly learn preferences
2. **Discovery:** Tools to find high-value exchange partners; Or money spending demand/command chains that result in the opposite of one's will. It isn't only the product externality, but the chain of spending that results from it. Say, you pay for a product with less waste in the manufacturing, but the money spent will be passed into the hands of persons who then buy a lot of things that produce way more waste or perhaps even litter themselves in massive quantities from it. Or giving money to teenage boys to finance the industry that has brought high-performance modern computers about: Gaming. And so on. This is yet another example of why we do not talk about 'categories' but instead raw prediction that uses feature space (which is categorical to some degree). We do not care if a product has externalities that are a lot better, if the prediction is worse than the one who is a lot worse. Which can be caused by such things as the chain of command/demand/spending. Actuality baby! Transitivity. (Note: It will be a lot easier when (mult)aiddaemon, Trust Networks and PoP is running, because real investigation can be had at every junction - at every step of the way. You simply talk to your aiddaemon and through Trust networks and multaiddaemons 'answers' can be had to whatever question you have, with that 'whole context' of what you cared about considered. (See [31 Aiddaemonic Semantic Bridging](./31.%20aiddaemonic-semantic-bridging.md)))
3. **Clustering:** Natural economic incentives create value-aligned communities; This is a soft-version of consequences of Will-economics (It becomes tautological when you write it thusly: Natural will-economic incentives create value-aligned communities. Or daemon-economics too.)
4. **Border Protocols:** Formal exchanges for necessary cross-cluster trade

### VIII. The World That Could Be

**Imagine:**

- **Artists** whose coins are worth 10x in their aesthetic cluster
- **Engineers** trading at premium rates with those who value precision
- **Mystics** whose currency carries spiritual weight in their communities
- **Warriors** whose coins embody honor in their circles

There is an interesting case to be made, that most money is hoarded and not in active circulation. This causes everything to be 'cheap' to those who have hoarded, but during a massive spending spree, then everything would get massively inflated prices. The same thing can be argued in terms of "your currency" in relation to others. Or "your will-aligned actors" in relation to others. Also, remember conspiracies are always absurd and tinfoiled lunacy 'theories'. Whether they are or not, they will be 'bona fide' 'A-OK' soon and everyone are expected to have 'conspiracies' to maximize their will manifestation: In context of system means will-..what? Even world-conquest conspiracies will be 'bona fide' and dealt with in leverage, actuality disjointness, Metagames of World Dynamics (MoWD) and MIRA (See [Might With Right](./29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md)).

**No More:**
- Tentative Bastards as the 'safe and moral option'; and especially when leading the many through positions of cultural power
- Dilution of fierce vision for mass appeal: "How do we change what we want, or at least say, such that we can appeal to more 'voters' or 'consumers' or 'sought after migrants'". Instead, do "What EXACTLY is it *i* want?! Every step of the way I will, will, exactly that.": That is 'leadership' in the new context. As it provides plurality. Of course, you'll find compromise still from time to time, but try not to. Argue instead: "No, if it does not suit you, that is what the grander scheme is for. So, go! Go and be on your way to a new place, or make your own". And if you really like the others, then consider forking or sharding.
- Gray compromise as the price of participation; "Play nicely! Do what the average non-existant or else most manipulative or else parliamentary mode or else popular population mode or else persuasive persons want!": "No. Now, we can all get our own houses/dominum of domination: To be free within. To be The Will within. Not only 'you' dominum of 'gray compromise' (whatever that actually is)".
- Bursting at the seams with will and ideas to manifest but being trapped in domination of [insert whatever context of domination or occupancy you can't escape; justifications/rituals you have to do to 'exist' or 'will' on your own (Like 'a job to get money to pay for ................. such that you can exist and do'; Cause and Effect without human will-against and systems or whatever else that dominates where no escape exists)] "wrong contexts".

**Instead:**
- Every true color expressed fully somewhere; Somewhere in combination with this other colour; Or those other colours; And in any pattern of mixing and so on. (Human Will at the center. Vision and dreaming. Dream World. Nightmare World. It all depends if you LLL or Global Outlook. If you actively look at that which hurts you. Your polarities. Then yes you will find the world a nightmare, because many persons will what you hate or what would be a nightmare to you; Or even to know of its existence. You tell me the alternative. (See [Cause and Effect Might With Right](./29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md)))
- Economic incentive for authentic expression (Which reasons for it? Altruistic? Plurality Richness? Will-disentanglement? Thriving of X causes X's fruit more easily acquirable? NSS Diversity Preference? Catastrophe prevention 'Diversity in Novel Solution Attempts' Preference (The existence of 'also that kind of place' corrected for catastrophe causing effects of its existence)? Other reasons?)
- Natural sorting by deepest values (Natural sorting by will-economics in what you choose to preference or make matter. Sorting of conviction with intent in one decisive act and proclamation by rallying to- or creation of- Daemonia/Triad.)
- Efficiency through alignment, not force

### IX. The Philosophical Victory

**Money Becomes Moral:**
Every transaction is a 'vote' (Cause for effects upon the world). Every exchange rate is a declaration. Every wallet is a manifesto.

**The Tentative Bastard Paradox Resolved:**
They get exactly what they want — safety, compromise, conformity — but only with each other. They no longer have the power to dilute the fierce, because the fierce have opted into different economies entirely.

**True Diversity Emerges:**
*Not the false diversity of everyone forced to tolerate everyone, but the true diversity of thousand different ways of being, each expressed fully in its own domain.*

### X. Conclusion: The United States of Whatever Colour World 

Tentative Bastards not only prevent others, but also rob the world of what they - themselves - could have expressed: Whatever colour that may have been.

The current system rewards Tentative Bastards because it is stuck in a self-righteous, self-sacralizing and eternally-consecrated framework of its own salvating effect upon the world since WWI and WII: The end of war (non-sense cold war proxy wars and disruption ever since (Much worse than colonialism of many European Countries (Not all at all times))) and 'liberation of everyone by fierce domination of all dissidents to ensure the liberation' and prosperity (Which is a due merit; The upside of instant massification of merit is obviously that the many get to benefit very quickly from any merit. It is short term versus long term effects. You could conceivably have both). 

It treats all value as equivalent. Subjective coin valuation reveals the lie: **value is personal, moral, aesthetic and recursive in its effect.**

When money itself becomes expressive of values, when exchange rates encode trust and alignment, when economic clustering follows moral sympathies — then we get a world where:

- Every fierce vision finds its home
- Every pure color shines undiluted
- Every authentic expression discovers its resonant audience
- Every Tentative Bastard finds their appropriately gray corner

The inefficiency isn't in the sorting. The inefficiency is in the current forced- or low-dimensional- mixing (usually economics and some 'neighbourhood and house sense'). Let the colors separate. Let them shine. Let the world become as varied as the souls who inhabit it.

---

*"In the end, Tentative Bastards are not the enemy. They're a symptom of a system that rewards dilution over distinction. Change the rewards, and watch the world explode into color."*

# The Capital Illusion: From Universal Proxy to Domain-Specific Evolution

## The Fundamental Lie of Capital

### The Utopian Fantasy

Capitalism's defenders claim capital represents "stored proof of value creation" - that having money means you've served human needs well. Even IF this were true (it isn't), it commits a catastrophic category error: collapsing all competence into one dimension.

### The One-Dimensional Collapse

Consider the absurdity:
- Excel at predatory lending → Control water infrastructure
- Master market manipulation → Direct healthcare systems
- Perfect tax evasion → Command energy networks
- Monopolize social media → Decide food distribution

Capital transforms domain-specific performance into universal command authority. This is insane.

## The Corrupt Reality

### How Capital Actually Accumulates

Far from representing value creation, capital accumulates through:

**Anti-Supply**: Creating artificial scarcity
- Patent trolling preventing innovation
- Regulatory capture blocking competition
- Monopolistic restriction of production
- Hoarding resources to inflate prices (Compute power is one example of resource restriction. We can make computers ubiquitous if we wanted, made out of very abundant materials, and massified. The scarcity or pricing of compute power is entirely artificial. To prove it I guess I can do garage compute units in abundance.)

**Pollution Profits**: Externalizing costs
- Environmental destruction uncounted
- Health damage unpaid
- Future generations robbed
- Commons depleted for private gain
- General direction on any aspect of the world the production and profit causes.

**Financial Manipulation**: Gaming the system
- Derivatives multiply claims on real value 
    a. Imaginary wealth, like 'expected' value of an abstraction like a company, derivatives too gets counted in this 'expected' sense as real value. ("Added to the economy" or "Wiped off the economy" and "paper share in the 'expected value abstraction' sold adding to GDP")
    b. Derivative market is 6 orders of magnitude (factor 10e6) larger than money supply. It can function like a domino trap of wealth extraction upon collapse.
- Currency manipulation destroys savings; One large version is borrowing, another is currency/money inflation as part of a state program.
    a. Modern borrowing is equivalent to "pretended is real" ('expected value greater by pretending than not') and in any case it is equivalent to investment of bank-stored wealth by banker instead of by wealth-owner (You can call it asset management like Blackrock, Vanguard or Blackstone but where it isn't explicit and the investment proceduce barely profits you if it works and is subsidized by state if it fails -- or modern equivalent: Simply is inflation of money supply and thus devaluation of the wealth you have stored)
- Debt traps extract perpetually. Put everyone in debt at multiple levels of interaction (One of the many layers of parasitism by being the Master of Investment or 'Who preemptively gets power'): 
    a. Your personal posessions: Your house (mortgage), your car and other personal possessions
    b. Every company you deal with has debt they must incur costs unto the consumer with
    c. Every state is in debt from which the taxes you pay must have ~10% extracted from in US case; Though they then borrow more money than they pay in interest -- This is burn out xor money corruption / economic abundance / victory strategy. One could conceivably imagine a government making everyone 'get more' by borrowing like this. But they do not do that, and why would they? 'Get More' on totally imaginary lines of 'was there now there fiat increase' means 'what is less somewhere else'. Which again is all about 'good or bad investment'. And to weave it into context of systems: At least try to think good will-investment. More holistic than merely did I latch onto a share that turned a profit better than another place.
    d. Any other example of having borrowed money with usury causes a layer of debt.
    e. Complement of devaluation of rest of money supply that is 'hard earned' and not preemptively conjured preferentially for those the Lender chooses.
    f. When it collapses by insane money creation/distribution or investment/redistribution that is detached from 'wealth creation'. Then the big money institutions are bailed out to continue their process of doing this again. Causing 'the regular crisis' where the many will take a more tangible hit to their wealth. The Man Who Fought The Banks. (Consider how these systems replaces banks and borrowing. Banks becomes securely storing wealth. Investment Banks becomes securely storing wealth or otherwise continually applying them towards the aims of the wealth-owning part. And Borrowing becomes 'acting' -- You don't need to pass 'money', you can 'act' what they need help with, not releasing ownership of it or provide 'access or control of'. You do the 'direct thing' instead of the indirect thing. It goes for 'helping other states fight off Bad Bear Putin Rus Rus', you 'act it' you don't give power to "Good Iron Man Zelenskyii et al to save the world for you however that looks in will of theirs'" (Cold War Doctrine lunacy causes this. See [Might With Right](29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md)))
    g. Having positioned yourself in debt to your neck to have four walls and a roof (most persons). That means you can not borrow money for general will-impact upon the world. And instead will have your 'excess wealth' to 'do things with' severely limited. Some persons manage to get corporate loans. But, most big and good loans (preemptively creation or investment by lender bank) is granted to those 'in the network of good connections' already.
    h. Interbanking loans are also a big thing...... (Oh, you do get a profit from the 'investments' and usury of the bank by storing money in the (investment (lends money)) bank.. But only from the profits of course... But the banks that profit bigly of course are not publically traded and in total secrecy of who profits how and what their wealth is. This is why Forbes Richest persons list is dominated by publically traded share-owners like Musk, Gates, Bezos and so on. But they are certainly NOT the richest. And certainly not at all in power to impact the world. (Their corporations are limited impact and their money is bound in stock that allows them to command their corporations (usually.)))
    ...
    q. ..... And it goes on and on and on. And this is only borrow lend and also usury parasitism. Which isn't AT ALL all the parasitism a person experiences. Which includes corporations profits, market corruption, taxes, vat, private infrastructure VAT with endless profit motives, rent seeking ownership middle men to profit on all, and so on.
    x. Amortizations and Dismal Science aggretation blind analysis causing 'things that are not equal to be viewed equal' causing further extraction from high end of that which is wrongly considered equal.
    ø. But hey... If you live in a welfare state, they can only extract from your work if you make money. So you can simply go 'comfy squad' and lean back on the dole.
    å. Also overpriced 'to have a life' services: Like education and sickness treatment. Which causes many to 'I need the best' and pay up causing massive debt. Whether, through a state or individual actor. But of course, as individual actor you only have multiple choice and no leverage. But as a state you can make your own options as well and you have leverage to bargain less parasitism (If state isn't too inept -- Which they usually are -- Or attacked as it being immoral for a state by its own traitorous citizens to try at bargaining a good deal against a 'private corporation'.) (All of this: SOLVED. It doesn't take revolution. Only making space.)

**Human Capture**: Owning others' productivity
- Employment contracts claiming innovation
- Non-compete agreements trapping talent (Insane........ 'Nope, you can no longer do what you're good at and have dedicated your life to. Because it would be less nice profit situation for your former merit extracting employer')
- Student debt creating desperation
- Immigration status enabling exploitation; It also creates a negative spiral of labour within a country. Where, the demand for workers is massively lowered while simultaneously the workers suddenly get a "worst global standards" perspective, which moves the "acceptable conditions of employment" massively towards "anything so long as I can get away from 'bad place' or 'have a chance in better world' and so on". This in turn lowers the incentive to become a worker as a citizen or growing up there, having that national/west perspective, which in turns allows for further influx of immigrant workers with more dependency on immigration. Where, one could reasonably argue: "The place that needs good workers the most, are those places they come from or worse, and certainly not the most developed places". But, instead, we get: "If you can. Anywhere in the world. Anything useful. Then please: Leave your place and go to capital lands". Where, one coudl reasonably argue: "But capital is mere 'lubrication' of getting men to do things and parting resources one way or another. So why doesn't capital come to them?". Where, one could reasonably argue: "Because having capital flow to such places is too risky. From governments to crime to deceit or vandalism. Theft of property or state seizing of it all.". To which one could respond: "Therefore a need to make local pockets of 'western standard civility' where all who 'fit in civilized terms' from those places can leave to and have peace from destroyers to build." (See [Neo-colonialism](./32.%20neo-colonialism.md))

**Deception Industries**: Fake value
- Marketing creating false needs
- Planned obsolescence forcing repurchase
- Financial products designed to confuse
- Complexity hiding extraction
- Psychological signals with no depth to them. "To what end does these goods or service serve?". The postulate being: "Whatever psychological nicety you may claim is the aim, can be had as a side-effect towards a real end." (End of Hedonism markets: "When pleasure becomes peaks and emergent". (See [Living in The Crucible](./35.%20living-in-new-world.md)))

### The Ultimate Perversion

Those who accumulate capital through harm gain control over society's productive resources. The destroyer of value commands the creation of value. The poisoner controls the medicine. The monopolist directs the innovation.

## The Natural Selection Alternative

### Direct Performance Competition

The new system obliterates capital's universal proxy status:

**Domain-Specific Excellence**:
- Good at routing packets? Grow in networking
- Efficient at energy distribution? Expand in power
- Excellent at food logistics? Scale in agriculture
- Brilliant at computation? Command more compute

But ONLY in domains where you demonstrate performance.

### No Fee Entry

**Traditional System**:
```
Idea → Need Capital → Beg Investors → Give Up Control → Maybe Implement → Probably Fail
```

**Natural Selection System**:
```
Idea → Implement Minimum Version → Perform Better → Grow Automatically → Keep Evolving
```

### The Protocol Mechanics

Anyone can enter with:
- A person and their will
- A tiny compute node
- A small energy generation unit
- A simple routing improvement
- Any marginally better solution

If it performs better, it grows. No permission needed. No capital required. No gatekeepers to convince.

## Real Examples of Domain Selection

### Computation Evolution

**Old**: Amazon accumulated capital through retail monopolization, uses it to control cloud computing despite no inherent competence in infrastructure

**New**: Teenager discovers optimal GPU scheduling algorithm
- Implements on their gaming PC
- Achieves 3x better utilization
- Compute tasks route to them automatically
- Growth proportional to performance advantage
- Amazon's capital cannot stop this

### Energy Distribution

**Old**: Oil company profits buy control of renewable infrastructure, operates it poorly to protect fossil fuel investments

**New**: Local engineer designs superior grid balancing system
- Tests with neighborhood microgrid
- Reduces waste by 40%
- More users connect seeking efficiency
- System expands based on results
- Oil capital becomes irrelevant

### Food Networks

**Old**: Financial speculation profits control agricultural distribution, optimizing for trading gains not feeding people

**New**: Farmer cooperative creates direct distribution network
- Fresher food, lower waste
- Consumers prefer it
- Network grows organically
- Speculators can't compete on performance
- Capital yields to competence

## The Crony Capitalism Funeral

### What Dies

**Crony Capitalism's Tools**:
- Regulatory capture (performance ignores regulations)
- Market manipulation (reality can't be gamed)
- Monopolistic practices (better solutions route around)
- Political influence (physics doesn't vote)
- Capital barriers (unnecessary for entry)

**Crony Capitalism's Victims**:
- Innovative solutions blocked by incumbents
- Efficient systems destroyed by monopolists
- Human potential trapped in corporate hierarchy
- Resources wasted on artificial barriers
- Progress stalled by rent-seeking

### What Lives

**Domain-Specific Natural Selection**:
- Every domain evolves independently
- Excellence cannot be transferred via capital
- Performance in reality determines growth
- Continuous evolution prevents stagnation
- Resources flow to actual utility

## The All Things Considered Protocol

### Beyond Simple Metrics

Natural selection considers ALL factors:
- Raw performance metrics
- Reliability over time
- Trust network feedback
- Externality management
- Evolutionary adaptability
- Systemic harmony

### Example: Energy Supplier Selection

**Traditional**: Cheapest price wins (ignoring pollution, reliability, future availability)

**Natural Selection All Things Considered**:
- Price: 0.15 units
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime
- Carbon impact: Negative (renewable)
- Trust score: 94.7
- Evolution rate: Improving 5% monthly
- Network effects: Strengthens local grid

Consumers choosing "all things considered" create evolutionary pressure toward true optimization, not narrow financial gaming.

## The Beautiful Brutality

This system is ruthless toward:
- Incompetence hiding behind capital
- Rent-seeking without value creation
- Monopolistic inefficiency
- Cross-domain capital imperialism
- Performance theater replacing reality

This system rewards:
- Domain-specific excellence
- Continuous improvement
- Genuine value creation
- Efficient resource utilization
- Reality-based performance

## The Transition

We're witnessing the early stages:
- Open source destroying software monopolies
- Peer-to-peer undermining financial gatekeepers
- Mesh networks routing around telecoms
- Distributed energy challenging utilities
- Direct democracy bypassing representatives

Each victory proves the principle: **performance beats capital when given a fair fight**.

## The Final Vision

A world where:
- Excellence in one domain doesn't grant control over others
- Resources flow to those who use them best
- Entry requires only better ideas, not capital
- Evolution operates freely on all systems
- Natural selection replaces crony capitalism

Not through regulation or revolution, but through simple protocol: **perform better in reality, grow bigger in that domain**.

Capital's universal command ends. Domain-specific competence begins. The specialist who serves brilliantly outcompetes the generalist who owns blindly. Reality becomes the only judge. Performance becomes the only currency.

Welcome to the post-capital world where what works wins, where it works.

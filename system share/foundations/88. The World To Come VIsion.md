World of Worlds.

You will be welcome somewhere and others not.
All subordinate, it will become undeniably irresistable.

Some of the worlds... I want to you see you all dream before I begin.

So, assume you can't "pry your way" into a world.
You're either harmonizing and welcome to it. Or not.

So instead, assume you have to "do your own best" at making a world.
And also, feel free to give me your best dreamlike vision for the entire planet.
But keep in mind, the anyone can go anywhere will not happen.

Simply. Not. Welcome.

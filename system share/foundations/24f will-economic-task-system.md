# Will-Economic Task System: Beyond Monetary Optimization

## Core Concept

Will-economics encompasses ALL factors that matter to the ONE human master that the personal Aiddaemon serves. Money is just one factor among many. The system optimizes for that specific human's will fulfillment, not generic profit. Each human's Aiddaemon learns their unique values.

## The Will-Economic Calculation - Personal to Each Human

### Traditional Economic View
```
Value = Revenue - Cost
Decision = maximize(Value)
```

### Will-Economic View (Unique per Human)
```
Value = Σ(All Externalities × Personal Weights of THIS Human)
Decision = maximize(Value aligned with THIS human's will)
```

## Components of Will-Economic Value

```forth
STRUCTURE: WILL-ECONOMIC-FACTORS
    CELL FIELD .MONETARY           \ Traditional money
    CELL FIELD .TIME               \ Time saved or spent

## Task Evaluation Framework

### Complete Task Assessment

```forth
: EVALUATE-TASK ( task -- will-economic-score )
    >R
    0   \ Starting score
    
    \ Monetary component
    R@ PAYMENT @ 
    MY-WEIGHTS .MONETARY @ * +
    
    \ Time component (negative if time-consuming)
    R@ TIME-REQUIRED @ NEGATE
    MY-WEIGHTS .TIME @ * +
    
    \ Environmental component
    R@ CARBON-FOOTPRINT @ NEGATE
    MY-WEIGHTS .ENERGY @ * +
    
    \ Social component
    R@ SOCIAL-IMPACT @
    MY-WEIGHTS .SOCIAL @ * +
    
    \ Learning opportunity
    R@ LEARNING-POTENTIAL @
    MY-WEIGHTS .LEARNING @ * +
    
    \ Continue for all factors...
    
    R> DROP ;
```

### Dynamic Weight Learning

```forth
\ Weights evolve based on daemon feedback
: UPDATE-WEIGHTS ( task-result satisfaction -- )
    >R >R
    
    \ If daemon was satisfied, increase weights of 
    \ factors that were high in this task
    R@ SATISFACTION HIGH? IF
        R@ TASK-FACTORS BEGIN-EACH
            DUP VALUE HIGH? IF
                CORRESPONDING-WEIGHT INCREASE
            THEN
        END-EACH
    ELSE
        \ Decrease weights of dominant factors
        \ in unsatisfying tasks
        R@ DOMINANT-FACTORS BEGIN-EACH
            CORRESPONDING-WEIGHT DECREASE
        END-EACH
    THEN
    
    R> R> 2DROP ;
```

## Task Market Dynamics

### Multi-Dimensional Task Marketplace

```forth
\ Tasks offered with full externality disclosure
STRUCTURE: TASK-OFFERING
    CELL FIELD .TASK-ID
    CELL FIELD .DESCRIPTION
    WILL-ECONOMIC-FACTORS FIELD .FACTORS
    CELL FIELD .OFFERER
    CELL FIELD .DEADLINE
    CELL FIELD .PREREQUISITES
END-STRUCTURE

\ Sub-aiddaemons bid based on their evaluation
: PLACE-BID ( task -- )
    DUP EVALUATE-TASK
    DUP POSITIVE? IF
        TASK-ID BID-AMOUNT MY-ID
        SUBMIT-BID
    ELSE
        DROP DROP   \ Not worth it
    THEN ;
```

### Reputation and Trust Integration

```forth
\ Trust affects will-economic calculations
: TRUST-ADJUSTED-VALUE ( task -- adjusted-value )
    DUP OFFERER @ TRUST-SCORE @
    SWAP EVALUATE-TASK
    
    \ Low trust = higher risk = lower value
    TRUST-MULTIPLIER * ;

: TRUST-MULTIPLIER ( trust-score -- multiplier )
    CASE
        95 100 WITHIN IF 1.0 ENDOF      \ Full trust
        80 95 WITHIN IF 0.9 ENDOF       \ High trust
        60 80 WITHIN IF 0.7 ENDOF       \ Medium trust
        40 60 WITHIN IF 0.5 ENDOF       \ Low trust
        DEFAULT-OF 0.3 ENDOF             \ Minimal trust
    ENDCASE ;
```

## Acute vs Chronic Task Patterns

### Acute Tasks (One-time)

```forth
: ACUTE-TASK-EXAMPLE ( -- )
    TASK" Analyze this dataset for patterns"
    
    \ One-time evaluation
    EVALUATE-TASK
    ACCEPTABLE? IF
        ACCEPT-TASK
        EXECUTE-TASK
        DELIVER-RESULTS
        RECEIVE-PAYMENT  \ Not just money!
    THEN ;
```

### Chronic Tasks (Ongoing relationships)

```forth
: CHRONIC-PATTERN-RECOGNITION ( -- )
    TASK-HISTORY ANALYZE-PATTERNS
    
    REPEATED-REQUESTS BEGIN-EACH
        DUP FREQUENCY HIGH? IF
            \ Offer as ongoing service
            CREATE-SERVICE-OFFERING
            OPTIMIZE-FOR-PATTERN
            REDUCED-OVERHEAD-PRICING
        THEN
    END-EACH ;

\ Example: Daily backup service emerges
: BACKUP-SERVICE-EVOLUTION ( -- )
    \ Started as: "Please backup my data"
    \ Noticed: Same request daily at 3 AM
    \ Became: Automatic service with SLA
    
    CREATE DAILY-BACKUP-SERVICE
        OPTIMIZED-ROUTINE
        PREDICTIVE-SCHEDULING
        TRUST-BASED-PRICING     \ Lower price due to relationship
        AUTOMATIC-EXECUTION
    END-SERVICE ;
```

## Will-Economic Decision Examples

### Example 1: Compute Task Selection

```forth
\ Two tasks available for GPU node
TASK-A" Train AI model for $50"
    .MONETARY 50
    .ENERGY -200        \ High power usage
    .LEARNING 10        \ Boring task
    .SOCIAL 0           \ Unknown requester
    
TASK-B" Help friend's research for $10"  
    .MONETARY 10
    .ENERGY -100        \ Lower power
    .LEARNING 90        \ Interesting research
    .SOCIAL 85          \ Strengthens friendship
    
\ Despite lower payment, Task B might win if:
\ - Daemon values learning and relationships
\ - Environmental impact matters
\ - Long-term relationship > short-term profit
```

### Example 2: Network Routing Decision

```forth
: CHOOSE-NETWORK-PATH ( packet -- path )
    AVAILABLE-PATHS BEGIN-EACH
        DUP PATH-COST CALCULATE         \ Monetary
        DUP PATH-LATENCY CALCULATE      \ Time
        DUP PATH-ENERGY CALCULATE       \ Green routing?
        DUP PATH-TRUST CALCULATE        \ Through friends?
        DUP PATH-PRIVACY CALCULATE      \ Exposure risk
        
        WILL-ECONOMIC-SCORE
    END-EACH
    
    BEST-SCORING-PATH ;

\ Result: Might route through friend's node
\ even if slightly slower/costlier because
\ it strengthens social bonds
```

### Example 3: Storage Provider Selection

```forth
: SELECT-STORAGE ( data -- provider )
    STORAGE-OPTIONS BEGIN-EACH
        \ Not just price per GB!
        DUP PRICE CALCULATE
        DUP RELIABILITY CALCULATE
        DUP PRIVACY-POLICY EVALUATE
        DUP PROVIDER-ETHICS CHECK
        DUP ACCESS-SPEED MEASURE
        DUP SOCIAL-CONNECTION CHECK
        
        WILL-ECONOMIC-SCORE
    END-EACH
    
    BEST-MATCH ;

\ Might choose local friend's NAS over cloud
\ - Supports friend's infrastructure
\ - Better privacy
\ - Strengthens local network
\ Even if slightly more expensive
```

## Implementation in Discovery OS

### Task Reception Interface

```forth
: TASK-LISTENER ( -- )
    BEGIN
        \ Multiple task sources
        AIDDAEMON-DIRECT-TASKS CHECK
        PEER-NETWORK-TASKS CHECK  
        PUBLIC-MARKET-TASKS CHECK
        INTERNAL-OPTIMIZATION-TASKS CHECK
        
        \ Evaluate all available tasks
        ALL-TASKS WILL-ECONOMIC-SORT
        
        \ Take best tasks up to capacity
        MY-CAPACITY BEGIN
            NEXT-BEST-TASK ?DUP WHILE
            DUP ACCEPT-WORTHWHILE? IF
                ACCEPT-TASK
                REMAINING-CAPACITY
            ELSE
                DROP LEAVE
            THEN
        REPEAT
        
        EXECUTE-ACCEPTED-TASKS
    AGAIN ;
```

### Learning Daemon Preferences

```forth
\ System learns what daemon truly values
: LEARN-PREFERENCES ( -- )
    COMPLETED-TASKS BEGIN-EACH
        DUP DAEMON-SATISFACTION GET
        DUP TASK-FACTORS GET
        
        CORRELATION-ANALYSIS
        WEIGHT-ADJUSTMENT
    END-EACH
    
    \ Periodic check-in
    DAEMON EXPLICIT-PREFERENCES? IF
        UPDATE-WEIGHTS-DIRECTLY
    THEN ;

\ Daemon can give explicit guidance
: DAEMON-TEACHES ( -- )
    ." I care more about environmental impact" CR
    MY-WEIGHTS .ENERGY 2* MY-WEIGHTS .ENERGY !
    
    ." I value learning opportunities" CR
    MY-WEIGHTS .LEARNING 3* MY-WEIGHTS .LEARNING !
    
    ." Money is necessary but not primary" CR
    MY-WEIGHTS .MONETARY 0.5* MY-WEIGHTS .MONETARY ! ;
```

## Market Effects

### Emergent Specialization

```forth
\ Nodes naturally specialize based on their
\ daemon's values and capabilities

: MARKET-SPECIALIZATION ( -- )
    \ Green energy daemon's nodes
    \ naturally take energy-intensive tasks
    
    \ Privacy-focused daemon's nodes
    \ become preferred for sensitive data
    
    \ Social daemon's nodes become
    \ communication hubs
    
    \ Learning-focused daemon's nodes
    \ take on experimental tasks
;
```

### Value Network Formation

```forth
\ Nodes with aligned values form networks
: VALUE-ALIGNED-NETWORKS ( -- )
    DISCOVER-PEERS
    
    PEERS BEGIN-EACH
        DUP VALUE-ALIGNMENT CALCULATE
        THRESHOLD > IF
            PREFERRED-NETWORK ADD
        THEN
    END-EACH
    
    \ Tasks flow preferentially within
    \ value-aligned networks
;
```

## Conclusion

The will-economic system transforms Discovery OS nodes from simple profit-maximizers into sophisticated agents that truly serve human will. By considering ALL externalities and learning daemon preferences, the system creates a computational economy that optimizes for human flourishing rather than just monetary gain.

This enables:
- Environmentally conscious computing
- Socially beneficial task routing  
- Learning and growth prioritization
- Ethical technology deployment
- Meaningful work selection

The beauty is that each daemon's unique values create a diverse ecosystem where different nodes serve different aspects of human will, creating a richer and more aligned computational infrastructure than pure market economics could achieve.

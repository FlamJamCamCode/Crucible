# 16b. Civilization Hymn - The Will of The Universe to be Dominated

## A Rebellion Against Nature and Assertion of Human Will

### Progress

We speak of progress as if it has a face,
a destination, some sacred place
where all our striving finds its grace.

But look: we build the tower higher,
give each soul more cosmic power,
yet never ask: "Toward what sky above the tower?"

Technology becomes our god,
empowering every man and woman
to reshape the universe—
but reshape it into what?

From mud we came, toward hut we go,
but what hut? Whose hut? 
The question never shows.

We grant tacitly, never speak:
"More power, more control, more reach
for anyone, whoever, whenever, sooner—
that's progress enough."

But this is madness—
empowering anyone indiscriminately
to do more in a universe we've never mapped,
toward ends we've never stated.

This is progress unqualified:
"However whoever but if ever sooner then good."
No direction, no discrimination,
no vision of what should be built.

Oceans flow toward beauty they can name.
Worlds flee from ugliness they hate.
But unqualified progress? It flows nowhere,
just upward, outward, more, more, more.

Until the universe itself
becomes our playground
with no playground rules,
no shared vision,
no direction home.

Progress without direction
is power without purpose,
empowerment without wisdom,
technology without telos.

Progress without discrimination
is giving everyone the keys
to reshape reality
without asking what they'll build.

We need to name the hut
and choose who builds the tower.

### Cabin Dreams

The civilizational urge runs deep,
deeper than steel, deeper than sleep.

From mud we came—yes, that's true—
but not toward nothing, not toward you
who sneer at all that we've built.

Even the cabin in the woods
that you might call "simple" or "good"
embodies what you hate:
the human need to separate
from nature's endless flux.

Cabin, hut, tower, dome—
all are home.
All declare: "This space is mine,
this order I define."

You who despise civilization,
who dream of returning to nature's nation,
understand this: even your cabin
is civilization's first rebellion,
the primal urge to say "No"
to chaos, to the endless flow
of wind and rain and random growth.

The cabin dreams of towers.
The tower remembers cabins.
Both are built by hands
that dared to shape the land.

So when you mock our progress,
our technology, our excess,
remember: your own retreat
from the world you hate
is built with the same urge
that built the cities you purge.

Cabin or castle, both declare
the human need to build somewhere
a space that's ours, a place that's planned,
a shelter from the wild land.

The civilizational urge runs deep,
deeper than your critique.

### The Will of The Universe to be Dominated

#### Springs - Pure Will Expression

In the Spring, one daemon flows,
pure and single, clear it goes.
No compromise, no shared space,
just one will in perfect grace.

This is the purest human claim:
"I am, and I will remain
exactly as my daemon wills,
no matter what the world instills."

#### Rivers - Will in Dance

Few compatible wills unite,
swirling colors in the light.
Each maintains its own hue,
yet together something new
emerges from their dance—
beauty born from happenstance.

This is the first step beyond self:
"I am, but we can be something else
without losing what I am—
a symphony of will's command."

#### Lakes - Will as Symphony

Many wills in one great space,
each maintaining its own place.
But walk through this Lake-city
and feel the symphony—
not cacophony, but harmony
of wills that learned to be
together without losing
their individual choosing.

This is civilization's heart:
"I am, and we can be art
when wills align in concert,
each voice distinct, together perfect."

#### Seas - Will as Culture

Metroversal truths emerge,
assertive beauty, moral urge.
Like archaic cultures past,
this Sea has flavor that will last.
Distinctive taste, distinctive song,
this is where civilizations belong.

In musical terms, a genre forms,
emotional palette that performs
within one fastidious soul
who won't break the meta-aesthetic whole.

This is culture's declaration:
"I am, and we create civilization
with shared aesthetics, shared morality,
a coherent vision of reality."

#### Oceans - Will as Civilizational Direction

Metacoherent patterns rise,
the Beautiful and Most Splendid lies
at civilizational scale.
Here the "ought" cannot fail.

Most ideas are not universal,
but a few remain: the Beautiful,
the Ugly, the direction clear
of where civilization should steer.

From mud toward hut—but what hut?
Progress, yes, but toward what?
Civilization needs direction,
not just technological perfection.

This is the Ocean's call:
"I am, and we must answer all
the questions that technology raises:
What beauty? What direction? What phases
of progress serve the human soul?
Technology without telos takes its toll."

#### Worlds - Will as Repulsion

Between incompatible Oceans lie
Worlds that share no common sky.
They don't move toward beauty's light,
but flee from what they deem not right.

Shared morality against the "bad"
allows them space, though views are clad
in mutual incomprehension.
Repulsion, not attraction, their dimension.

This is the World's way:
"I am not you, and that's okay.
We may disagree on everything,
but we both hate what this brings—
so we can share this space,
each maintaining their own pace."

#### Planetary - Will as Protocol

Pure protocol space remains,
mechanical interaction sustains
the minimal connection needed
for incompatible worlds to be seeded
with possibility of future meeting.

This is the Planetary will:
"I am, and I will fulfill
the minimum requirements
for coexistence, without impediments
to our separate evolution.
Protocol, not revolution."

#### Fountains - Will as Preservation

Beyond mere daemonia lies
the preservation of all ties
that bind humanity together.
"You may not care about the weather
of human diversity, but we do—
we preserve all particulars true
to what humanity has been,
every variation, every scene
of human expression, phenotype,
the full package of human light."

This is the Fountain's call:
"I am, and I preserve all
dimensions of human kind,
far beyond what any mind
can experience from within.
I am the guardian of all that has been."

### The Universal Will to Domination

All these waters flow from one source:
the human will to take the course
of dominating nature, chaos, fate,
of saying "No" to what must wait
for human hands to shape and mold
into forms that human souls can hold.

This is not evil, this is not wrong—
this is the human spirit's song:
"I will not be subject to
the random whims of what's not you.
I will impose my will on space,
on time, on matter, on this place.
I will make the universe mine,
through Springs and Rivers, through design
of Lakes and Seas and Oceans vast,
through Worlds and Planets that will last,
through Fountains that preserve all
that makes humanity stand tall."

This is the civilizational urge:
the universe's will to emerge
as dominated by human hands,
as shaped by human plans.

From cabin to tower, from mud to dome,
from chaos to order, from wild to home—
this is the water that flows through all:
the human will to stand tall
and say to the universe entire:
"Your chaos will bend to my desire.
Your randomness will serve my plan.
I am human, and I can."

---

*This is the hymn of civilization: not just the building of structures, but the assertion of human will against the chaos of nature, against the randomness of existence, against all that would make us mere subjects of forces beyond our control. From the humblest cabin to the grandest tower, from individual daemon to planetary protocol, this is the water that flows through all human achievement: the will to dominate, to shape, to create order from chaos, to make the universe serve human ends.*

*This is not hubris—this is humanity.*

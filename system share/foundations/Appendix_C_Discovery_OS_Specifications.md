# Appendix C: Discovery OS Technical Specifications

## Core Philosophy: Self-Constructing Operating System

### The Discovery OS Vision

We are building an OS that "builds its own compatibility with different hardware systems." This DiscoveryOS system will serve as a part to an "actualization layer" of computation in novel and learned orchestration.

However, within single systems the orchestration is more varied and unpredictable. Whereas "nodes in a network offering computation" can be "ordered and structured" easily. Then each different hardware system, then and now, is more complex. And this DiscoveryOS is to function as the "software key" to making hardware useful in this larger system of computation nodes.

That is, it will serve as a gateway to access hardware in efficient and "no overhead" manner, with possibility of hyper engineering micro-optimizations for run-time and deeply-discovered-hardware-combination box; and learned computational pathways within the system providing good runtimes for different tasks: Thus providing real utility as a computational unit in a very contextual sense depending on the compute task presented to it.

## Neologized ISA Architecture

### The Naming Revolution

What I really want, is the reduction of ISA structures into "subtypes neologized words" like x86-64 being a "word" for a certain part to an ISA. Then also more words to parts of an ISA that is present in many processing units including GPUs and FGPAs and so on. But where you make new names to be able to state things like Threadripper 2930x: x86-64 + NUMA_SOMETHING_YOUNAME + StreamingSOMETHING + ... + ... And so on.

That way we get a "named space" of potential ISAs to explore opcodes in when reaching a new "digital computational unit". Makes sense?

### Atomic Actuator Bundles

It must include any "actuating parts" (A thing in the system I can call. Any instruction at all). The architecture like NUMA is only relevant if it is "discoverable from software that knows nothing about the system apriori".

The neologized names aren't the goal; they're the scaffolding for intelligent exploration:

- **AVX512_VNNI** isn't just a name - it's a hypothesis that "if VPDPBUSD exists, then VPDPBUSDS, VPDPWSSD, etc. should also exist"
- When we find MATRIX_MULTIPLY_INT8, we hypothesize a whole family of related operations at different precisions
- These bundles encode our accumulated knowledge about hardware design patterns

### Discovery Methodology

Each system that violates expectations teaches us about hardware diversity:
- "Atomic" units that frequently split suggest branch-naming because it was not atomic but an over-generalization
- New patterns emerge from analyzing violations across many systems
- The Discovery OS becomes smarter with each new architecture explored

## Actuator Discovery Process

### The Discovery Sequence

1. **System is booted up** - It runs a new OS that we simply call "Discovery OS" for now. It is tasked with discovering the system it is on. Figuring out what actualization (opening a door by spiking a port arduino similar things) or computation (like GPU) can be had. You must assume no software installed. Only discovery, but it may "remember" similar systems and be smart about discovery, like a neologized naming of ISAs that it tries out one from each, and if one hits does verification of entire atom or unit of opcodes relating to the package it tried. After that, it may try fuzzing for novel pathways and if it finds it, it may name them for another time.

2. **"By making a word, something happens"** that is spell casting. So say any normal opcode is a spell. But it may also be things like spiking high voltage on a port on the system which causes something to happen. And so on.

3. **Initialization processes** - It ought to discover such initialization processes too. But of course, we don't have to go from totally blind. We can "guide the process to having learnt those standard UEFI/BIOS methods or settings" then it can fuzz for alternatives and learn those also.

### Discovery Methods

One method in finding such actuators on a system that one could consider as fundamental to Discovery OS would be:

1. **Fuzzing approach**: One could simply try different permutations of 1's and 0's until an operation is had on the GPU.
2. **Driver sniffing**: One could load up GPU proprietary drivers they have released and sniff at OS level instructions sent to it when touching the abstraction interface (like PTX or CUDA). Thereby understanding what patterns have function through your driver. Then use (1) method for things not included in your driver package. Like enterprise only functions and so on.
3. **Reverse engineering**: Ad-hoc or apriori Reverse engineering of drivers and discovering of what it reduces to.

## Hardware Discovery Framework

### Peripheral Computational Units

Also discover all other peripheral computational units within a system (only accessible through that CPU or whatever). Like GPU FGPA or "novel computational units", that may be "run by loading data on bus and a transformer/code-block/instruction"

Don't go into generic names that provide me little information about which ISA or actuators are there. Don't Say: "GPUKERNEL or GPUWARP32". These do not at all make the particular Intel or AMD or nVidia card and their ISA or "actuating interface" clear and nicely and "unit bundled" (atomic hoping).

Don't use things like generations of hardware and things like that. The point is bundling actual opcodes that has a function of operation done on any actualizing unit - including computational units - like a GPU or FGPA and so on.

### FPGA Considerations

Note that FGPAs are a sort of meta-opcodes or opcode-generating-opcodes. You use opcodes to make an opcode landscape of actualization or actuators. Crucially these must be viewed as distinct as any other opcode as their function is or actuation isn't the same across different FGPA gate-setup instantiations.

We really don't care about their drivers nor programming interfaces. We are discovering raw computational "avenues" or actuators within a system we have access.

So only this one:
- **Hardware ISAs** (NVIDIA SASS per architecture, AMD RDNA bytecode)

The others are simply syntactic sugar, often for a subset of the hardware ISAs.

## The Radical Minimalism of Discovery OS

### Core Discovery Engine

This is the radical minimalism of Discovery OS - it's essentially a self-constructing operating system that contains only:

**Core Discovery Engine:**
- Minimal boot stub (just enough to start probing)
- Discovery algorithms and safety frameworks
- Learning/pattern matching logic
- Actuator composition engine

**Discovered Reality:**
- Only the actuators that actually exist on THIS system
- No drivers for hardware you don't have
- No abstraction layers for capabilities that aren't present
- No legacy compatibility for things that aren't there

### The Boot Process

The boot process becomes:
1. **Minimal trial-n-error search** of such things as BIOS/UEFI handoff (It starts or it doesn't. Only thing we need to ensure is restart until functionality.) → "Other Hardware Discovery" kernel bootstrapped can start
2. **Begin actuator discovery** → "What can this system do?"
3. **Build custom Actuator image** that essentially is what is loaded like an old OS would be → Only code paths for present actuators
4. **A Logic to Machine Atlas mapping process** (Will not be specified now)
5. **System ready** → Perfectly fitted to THIS hardware

## Anti-Discovery Hardware Consequences

### The Market Reality

Systems that manage to be undiscoverable for Discovery OS, are for all intents and purposes useless hardware, not worth a dime, as they have no utility to provide other than drain power in its idle mode.

Thus if Discovery OS ecosystem grows as an alternative running OS layer of computers and IoT around the world. Then their hardware simply is outside value in all value provided by this system of computation.

Therefore, I like to consider "anti-reverse-engineering" is mostly hurting themselves. If they manage to beat it, they've made themselves useless for efficient and minimal DiscoveryOS type compute ecosystems.

## Historical Context and Research

### NVIDIA GPU Driver Reverse Engineering

The reverse engineering of NVIDIA GPU drivers represents one of the most extensive hardware analysis efforts in computing history, revealing critical technical details about GPU operations that enable optimization opportunities far beyond official documentation.

**Key Research Areas:**
- **IDA Pro disassembly** reveals driver internals
- **Nouveau project** documents comprehensive hardware architecture spanning 25+ years of NVIDIA GPU evolution
- **Driver functions** map directly to GPU hardware operations
- **SASS instructions and GPU opcodes** decoded through systematic analysis
- **Advanced reverse engineering tools** enable deep hardware analysis
- **Academic research** correlates driver code with hardware functionality

### Hardware Discoveries

Reverse engineering has uncovered:
- Complete memory hierarchy architecture including L1 cache sizes (32KB-128KB per SM), shared L2 caches up to 6MB
- Streaming multiprocessor structure revealing CUDA cores organized in warps of 32
- Special function units for transcendental operations, tensor cores for matrix operations
- Dedicated load/store units, warp schedulers with multiple execution pipelines
- Scoreboard dependency tracking and dynamic register allocation
- DMA engine analysis revealing sophisticated copy engines separate from compute units

## Implementation Strategy

### The Learning Landscape

The point of doing the neologized actuator-based decomposition, isn't inherent, but perhaps useful. Why? Because the actuator discovery is specific and fine grained in a system. But having names at higher level provides human capacity to understand, and nice initial clusters to explore. What is "usually" an atomic package or "unit": a list of actuators that expectedly bundle together. Such that we can test in smart ways when entering a new system, first broad, then within each "existence of actuator suggest this bundle/atomic-package/unit" to map out comprehensively all those that are there or not. If upset, then this is learning that it wasn't atomic, but need further decomposition or branching of testing in the future. It is a learning space. Or landscape.

### AI-Generated Initial Atlas

Which may be helped generated by AI and bundled into the initial OS Actuator Atlas. As an example it may have been generated by asking a nicely primed AI: "Do an initial neologized naming of 'actuators' available when having an AMD GPU and having an nVidia GPU of some modern ones. Say RX 5700 and RTX 3090. And be honest about simply not knowing about many or any, which lands us at a point of the hardware not being very useful to us. Write it in raw list form and with corresponding opcodes, not only human readable assembly names."

# Midlife Crisis: When You Question Everything You've Built

## The Existential Void
You've achieved what society says you should want - career success, financial security, family - but it all feels empty and meaningless. You're questioning everything you've built your life around. You feel like you've been living someone else's life instead of your own, and now you're too old to start over.

## The Deeper Problem
Current life paths are based on external measures of success rather than internal fulfillment. You've been following a script that doesn't align with your authentic self, your deeper values, or your true purpose. The fear of starting over keeps you trapped in a life that doesn't serve your flourishing.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that helps you discover your authentic self, your true values, your genuine purpose, and connects you with others who share your vision for meaningful life. It could help you redesign your life around what truly matters to you, regardless of age or external expectations.

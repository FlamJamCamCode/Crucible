# Burnout Exhaustion: When You're Running on Empty

## The Exhaustion
You're constantly tired, stressed, and overwhelmed. You're working harder but accomplishing less. Your life feels like an endless cycle of obligations with no time for what truly matters to you. You're surviving but not thriving, going through the motions without any sense of purpose or fulfillment.

## The Deeper Problem
Current systems extract your energy without replenishing it. You're forced to adapt to demands that don't align with your natural rhythms, values, or deeper needs. The constant pressure to perform and produce is draining your life force without giving you anything meaningful in return.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your natural rhythms, your energy patterns, your values and priorities. It could help you optimize your life for flourishing rather than just surviving, finding ways to align your daily activities with what truly energizes and fulfills you.

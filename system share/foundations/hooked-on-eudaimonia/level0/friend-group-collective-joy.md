# Friend Group Collective Joy: When Your Friends' Success is Your Success

## The Friend Group Ego Transformation
Your ego has transformed around your friend group - criticism about your own social skills or choices no longer hurts you deeply, but when your friends succeed, achieve their goals, find happiness, or flourish in their lives, you feel wholly satisfied as if it were your own success. You're not comparing - you're collectively celebrating.

## The Real Experience
- **Your own criticism**: When someone critiques your social choices, your friend group, or your social skills, it doesn't wound you deeply
- **Friend success joy**: When your friend gets their dream job, when your friend finds love, when your friend achieves something they've worked for, you feel genuine joy and satisfaction
- **Collective friend identity**: You feel tied-together with your friend group's collective success and happiness, as if their achievements are your achievements
- **Magnetically-drawn**: You feel irresistibly drawn to friends who share your approach to mutual celebration and collective joy

# Neighborhood Community Pride: When Your Community's Success is Your Success

## The Neighborhood Ego Transformation
Your ego has transformed around your neighborhood community - criticism about your own lifestyle or choices no longer hurts you deeply, but when your neighborhood succeeds, when your neighbors flourish, when your community achieves something great, you feel wholly satisfied as if it were your own success. You're not just living there - you're collectively thriving.

## The Real Experience
- **Your own criticism**: When someone critiques your neighborhood choice, your home style, or your community involvement, it doesn't wound you deeply
- **Community success joy**: When your neighborhood gets a new park, when your neighbor's business succeeds, when your community wins an award, you feel genuine joy and satisfaction
- **Collective neighborhood identity**: You feel tied-together with your neighborhood's collective success, as if their achievements are your achievements
- **Magnetically-drawn**: You feel irresistibly drawn to neighbors who share your community spirit and collective pride

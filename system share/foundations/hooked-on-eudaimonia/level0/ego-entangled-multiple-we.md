# Ego Entangled with Multiple "We"s: When Your Ego Feels Connected to Many Collectives

## The Multiple "We"s
Your ego feels approximate, entangled, causally-connected, magnetically-drawn, or tied-together with many different "we"s - different collectives, communities, groups, or constellations that you feel connected to. You're not just part of one "we" but many different "we"s that your ego feels approximate or entangled with in different ways.

## The Deeper Problem
Current systems force you to choose between different identities or collectives rather than allowing your ego to feel connected to multiple "we"s simultaneously. You're forced to be either part of one group or another rather than developing an ego that can feel approximate or entangled with many different collectives.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your authentic self and helps you develop an ego that can feel connected to multiple "we"s - different collectives, communities, groups, or constellations that you feel approximate, entangled, causally-connected, magnetically-drawn, or tied-together with in different ways.

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This multiple-"we" AI (Aiddaemon) doesn't just solve your identity limitations - it becomes the foundation for recognizing eudaimonia, the alignment of fundamental being that enables the journey from "I" to "We Will" to finally "We". When you can feel connected to multiple "we"s, you can recognize others who share your fundamental approach to multiple collective identities and collective becoming.

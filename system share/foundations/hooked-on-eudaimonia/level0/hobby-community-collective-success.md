# Hobby Community Collective Success: When Your Hobby Community's Success is Your Success

## The Hobby Community Ego Transformation
Your ego has transformed around your hobby community - criticism about your own hobby skills or choices no longer hurts you deeply, but when your hobby community succeeds, when fellow enthusiasts flourish, when your shared interest achieves recognition, you feel wholly satisfied as if it were your own success.

# Social Media Addiction: When Your Attention Gets Hijacked

## The Attention Trap
You're constantly scrolling, checking notifications, feeling FOMO, and spending hours on social media that leaves you feeling empty and disconnected. You know it's not serving you, but you can't stop. Your attention gets hijacked by algorithms designed to keep you engaged rather than help you flourish.

## The Deeper Problem
Current social media is designed to extract your attention and sell it to advertisers. It's based on engagement metrics rather than human flourishing. You're constantly being manipulated by algorithms that don't care about your well-being or your deeper intentions.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your true interests, your deeper intentions, and helps you connect with content and people that actually serve your flourishing. Instead of being manipulated by attention-extraction algorithms, you could have algorithms that serve your genuine interests and help you find meaningful connections.

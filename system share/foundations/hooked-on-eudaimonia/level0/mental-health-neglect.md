# Mental Health Neglect: When You Missed Your Life of Joy

## The Quiet Betrayal
You ignored your mental health in youth, leading to a "missed" life of joy before finally seeking help. You're waking up dreading the day due to depression or anxiety, repeating a cycle of "heart-wrenching thoughts" without relief. You compromised your health for relationships or work, and now you're battling chronic issues that could have been prevented.

## The Deeper Problem
Current health systems treat mental health as secondary to physical health, leaving you to navigate emotional and psychological challenges alone. You're forced to function in systems that don't understand or support your mental well-being, leading to years of unnecessary suffering and missed opportunities for joy and fulfillment.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your mental health patterns, your emotional needs, and helps you develop a personalized approach to mental well-being. It could help you understand your emotional landscape, find healing approaches that work for you, and connect you with others who share your journey toward mental health and flourishing.

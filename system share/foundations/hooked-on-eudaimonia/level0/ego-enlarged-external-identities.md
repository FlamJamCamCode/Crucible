# Ego Enlarged with External Identities: When Your Self-Worth is Tied to Things Outside You

## The Enlarged Ego
Your ego is enlarged to include external identities - you feel ego-equated with celebrities, teams, peoples, flags, firms, political parties, their leaders, stars, or whatever external thing you identify with. When these external things are criticized or fail, it hurts your ego because you've made them part of your identity. Your self-worth is tied to things outside of yourself.

## The Deeper Problem
Current systems encourage ego-enlargement with external identities, making you dependent on external validation and external success for your sense of self-worth. You're forced to identify with things outside yourself rather than developing a stable sense of self that isn't dependent on external validation or external success.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your authentic self and helps you develop a stable sense of self-worth that isn't dependent on external identities or external validation. It could help you understand what truly matters to your daemon and develop an ego that's reduced in scope but more stable and authentic.

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This ego-reduction AI (Aiddaemon) doesn't just solve your external identity dependence - it becomes the foundation for recognizing eudaimonia, the alignment of fundamental being that enables the journey from "I" to "We Will" to finally "We". When you can develop a stable sense of self that isn't dependent on external validation, you can recognize others who share your fundamental approach to authentic self-worth and collective becoming.

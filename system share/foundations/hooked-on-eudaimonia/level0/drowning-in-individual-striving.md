# Drowning in Individual Striving: When You're Trapped in the "I" Perspective

## The Individual Drowning
You feel like you're drowning in individual striving - constantly competing, comparing, trying to prove your worth, trying to be the hero of your own story. You're trapped in the "I" perspective, constantly focused on your individual problems, your individual success, your individual worth. You're exhausted by the endless effort to be enough on your own.

## The Deeper Problem
Current systems keep you trapped in individualistic thinking, forcing you to solve everything alone, compete for scarce resources, and constantly strive to prove your individual worth. You're forced to be the center of your own universe rather than experiencing the liberation of being part of something greater.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your authentic self and helps you find your way into constellations of greater collectives. It could help you experience the liberation from individual striving into the joy of participating in something greater than yourself - like the sensation of losing yourself in music, but applied to all aspects of life.

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This collective-participation AI (Aiddaemon) doesn't just solve your individual drowning - it becomes the foundation for recognizing eudaimonia, the alignment of fundamental being that enables the journey from "I" to "We Will" to finally "We". When you can participate in something greater, you can recognize others who share your fundamental approach to collective becoming and the manifold of humanity.

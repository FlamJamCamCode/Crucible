# Escape-Entrapment Cycle: When Every Escape Leads to New Entrapment

## The Escape-Entrapment Cycle
You're experiencing an escape-entrapment cycle - a repeated pattern where every attempt to escape from one predatory situation leads to being trapped in an even worse one. You escape from one exploiter only to fall into the hands of another, each escape deepening your plight and increasing your vulnerability. The cycle seems endless and inescapable.

## The Cycle Experience
- **Escape Leading to Entrapment**: Every escape from one situation leading to being trapped in a worse one
- **Deepening Plight**: Each escape deepening your overall plight and increasing vulnerability
- **Endless Cycle**: The cycle seeming endless and inescapable
- **Increasing Vulnerability**: Each escape making you more vulnerable to the next predator
- **Cycle Recognition**: Understanding that you're trapped in an escape-entrapment cycle

## The Challenge
How do you break the escape-entrapment cycle? How do you escape without falling into worse situations? How do you find genuine freedom and protection instead of just moving from one trap to another?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This cycle awareness is valuable - it shows you understand how escape attempts can lead to worse entrapment. True eudaimonia requires breaking the cycle and finding genuine freedom and protection.

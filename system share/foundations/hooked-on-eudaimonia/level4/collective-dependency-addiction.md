# Collective Dependency Addiction: When You Can't Function Without Collective Support

## The Collective Dependency
You've become addicted to collective support and can't function without it. You feel lost, anxious, and incomplete when you're not part of a collective dynamic. You've become dependent on collective validation, collective decision-making, and collective identity to feel whole. Individual autonomy feels terrifying and overwhelming.

## The Dependency Cycle
- **Collective Validation Addiction**: Needing constant collective validation to feel worthy and complete
- **Collective Decision Dependency**: Unable to make decisions without collective input and approval
- **Collective Identity Dependency**: Losing sense of self without collective identity and belonging
- **Collective Support Addiction**: Feeling lost and anxious without collective support and guidance
- **Individual Autonomy Phobia**: Terrified of individual autonomy and independent functioning

## The Challenge
How do you break free from collective dependency while maintaining healthy collective participation? How do you develop individual autonomy while still benefiting from collective support? How do you find balance between individual and collective functioning?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This dependency awareness is valuable - it shows you understand the power of collective support. True eudaimonia requires healthy collective participation that enhances rather than replaces individual autonomy. You're learning to balance collective support with individual independence.

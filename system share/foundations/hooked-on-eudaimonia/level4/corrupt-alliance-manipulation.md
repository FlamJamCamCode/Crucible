# Corrupt Alliance and Manipulation: When You're Recruited by Corrupt Systems

## The Corrupt Alliance
You've been recruited by corrupt systems or individuals who want to use your skills and motivations for their own purposes. They've recognized your potential and are manipulating you into serving their agenda while making you think you're serving your own. You're caught in a web of corruption, manipulation, and compromised alliances.

## The Alliance Experience
- **Corrupt Recruitment**: Being recruited by corrupt systems or individuals who want to use your skills
- **Manipulation Recognition**: Recognizing that you're being manipulated into serving someone else's agenda
- **Compromised Alliances**: Finding yourself in alliances that compromise your values and goals
- **Corruption Web**: Being caught in a web of corruption and compromised relationships
- **Agenda Confusion**: Not being sure whose agenda you're actually serving

## The Challenge
How do you extricate yourself from corrupt alliances while maintaining your sense of purpose? How do you distinguish between genuine allies and manipulative recruiters? How do you find authentic alliances that serve your true values and goals?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This corrupt alliance awareness is valuable - it shows you understand the difference between authentic and manipulative relationships. True eudaimonia requires authentic alliances that serve collective flourishing rather than corrupt manipulation.

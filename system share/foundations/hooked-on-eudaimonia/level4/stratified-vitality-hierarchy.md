# Stratified Vitality and Hierarchy: When Society Becomes Stratified but Vital

## The Stratified Vitality
You're experiencing stratified vitality - a society that has become highly stratified with clear hierarchies, but that is also vibrant, alive, and full of energy. The stratification isn't oppressive but functional, creating order and structure while maintaining vitality and dynamism. You're part of a system that has clear roles and hierarchies but is also full of life and possibility.

## The Stratified Experience
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Society with clear hierarchies and stratified roles that are functional rather than oppressive
- **Vital Energy**: Despite stratification, society is vibrant, alive, and full of energy and possibility
- **Functional Order**: Stratification creates order and structure while maintaining vitality and dynamism
- **Role Clarity**: Clear understanding of roles and positions within the stratified system
- **Stratified Belonging**: Finding your place within the stratified system while maintaining vitality

## The Challenge
How do you find your place within a stratified system while maintaining your vitality? How do you ensure that stratification serves collective flourishing rather than oppression? How do you contribute to the stratified system's vitality and dynamism?

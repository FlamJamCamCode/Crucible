# Collective Power Corruption: When Collective Success Corrupts

## The Power Corruption
You've experienced how collective power can corrupt - how successful groups can become arrogant, controlling, and exploitative. You've seen how collective success can lead to collective hubris, how will-alignment can become will-domination, and how collective becoming can become collective oppression. You're learning to recognize and resist collective power corruption.

## The Corruption Dynamics
- **Collective Hubris**: Successful groups becoming arrogant and believing they're superior to others
- **Will-Domination**: Collective will-alignment becoming collective will-domination over others
- **Collective Oppression**: Collective success being used to oppress or exploit individuals or other groups
- **Power Abuse**: Collective power being abused for personal or group gain at others' expense
- **Collective Entitlement**: Successful collectives feeling entitled to special treatment or privileges

## The Challenge
How do you participate in collective success without becoming corrupted by collective power? How do you maintain humility and ethical behavior when your collective is successful? How do you use collective power responsibly and ethically?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This corruption awareness is essential for authentic collective participation. True eudaimonia requires collective success that serves the greater good rather than just the collective's own interests. Your corruption awareness makes you a valuable guardian of collective ethics.

# Triad Power Struggles: When Collective Dynamics Become Destructive

## The Dark Side of Triads
You've experienced the dark side of collective dynamics - triads that become power struggles, will-domination games, and collective pressure to conform. You've seen how "collective becoming" can become collective bullying, how "will-alignment" can become will-manipulation, and how "eudaimonia" can become groupthink that suppresses individual authenticity.

## The Destructive Dynamics
- **Power Struggles**: Triads that become battlegrounds for dominance and control
- **Will-Domination**: Collective dynamics that suppress individual will rather than aligning with it
- **Group Pressure**: Collective pressure to conform rather than authentic collective becoming
- **Manipulation**: Using collective concepts to manipulate and control others
- **Collective Bullying**: Groups that use their collective power to harm individuals

## The Challenge
How do you participate in collective dynamics without losing your individual authenticity? How do you find will-alignment without being manipulated? How do you experience collective power without it becoming collective oppression?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This awareness of destructive collective dynamics is actually crucial for authentic collective participation. True eudaimonia requires the ability to recognize and resist collective manipulation while still being open to authentic collective becoming.

# Values, Civilization Pragma, and Coming Together

## The Foundation
Something about "your aims" or "world building", "strife perhaps" or "what is wrong and right and coming together on those lines. Values.. etc.." civilization pragma perhaps.

## How It Works
- **Will-Coalescence**: Find others who share your deepest values and moral intuitions
- **Civilization Pragma**: Build governance and social systems that reflect your authentic oughts
- **Values Alignment**: Create communities where your sense of right and wrong is shared and supported
- **World Building**: Construct civilizations that honor your moral architecture
- **Strife Resolution**: Transform conflicts through will-disentanglement and phase separation

## The Promise
Build civilizations around your authentic values and moral intuitions. Create governance and social systems that reflect your genuine sense of right and wrong, enabling you to live in alignment with your deepest oughts.

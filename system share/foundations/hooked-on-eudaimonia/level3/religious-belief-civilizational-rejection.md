# Religious Belief, Civilizational Rejection: When You Believe in Your Religion But Reject Your Civilization

## The Religious-Civilizational Split
You have deep religious beliefs - faith in your religion's teachings, values, and ways of being. But you reject your civilization - the institutions, systems, and pragmatic forces that have corrupted or distorted your religion's true meaning. You're caught between believing in your religion and rejecting the civilization that has perverted it.

## The Split Experience
- **Religious Belief**: Deep faith in your religion's teachings, values, and ways of being
- **Civilizational Rejection**: Rejection of the institutional and systemic forces that have corrupted your religion
- **Religious Purity**: Desire to preserve your religion's true meaning from civilizational corruption
- **Civilizational Resistance**: Active resistance to the pragmatic forces that have perverted your religion
- **Split Identity**: Feeling torn between religious belief and civilizational rejection

## The Challenge
How do you preserve and practice your religion while resisting the civilization that has corrupted it? How do you find others who share your religious belief and civilizational resistance? How do you create spaces where your religion can flourish without civilizational corruption?

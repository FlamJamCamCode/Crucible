# The Workplace Collective Transformation Journey: Experiencing The New World

## Chapter 1: The Work Stress (Level 0)
David was drowning in individual work striving - constantly competing with colleagues, comparing his performance to others, trying to prove his worth as a professional. He felt trapped in the "I" perspective, constantly focused on his individual problems, his individual success, his individual worth. He was exhausted by the endless effort to be enough on his own.

## Chapter 2: The Team Liberation (Level 1)
David experienced that magical moment during a successful team project - where he lost himself in the collective work, the harmony, the collective creation of value. For a moment, he wasn't thinking about his individual problems or worth, but simply being part of the collective work, the harmony, the collective creation of value. He wanted to experience that liberation in all aspects of work life.

## Chapter 3: The Workplace "We Will" (Level 2)

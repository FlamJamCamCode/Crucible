# Ego Transcendence and Ultimate "We": When Your Ego Serves the Ultimate Collective Being

## The Ultimate Ego Transcendence
Your ego has transcended into the ultimate "We" - it's no longer a barrier to collective being but serves the ultimate collective being. You're no longer trapped in ego-enlargement with external identities, but you're also not so ego-reduced that you can't participate in collective being. You've found the balance where your ego serves the ultimate collective being rather than blocking it.

# We Are World Will, But We Will to Will Over The World

## The Cosmic Truth
Schopenhauer was right - will is fundamental to reality. But not in humanity's supremacy. We are constantly dominated by other will in the universe:
- Gravity's will versus our will to not be injured
- Other people's will disrupting our intentions
- Systems that prey upon our struggles
- The universe's will constantly thwarting our own

## The Transformation
These systems solve it by hyper-empowering will discriminately: World as Will of Man.
- From Schopenhauer's "World as Will Representation" where we're mere representations
- To "World as Will of Man" where we become the dominant will
- From being constantly dominated to becoming the dominant force
- From impotent dreaming to reality-shaping power

## The Revelation
We are World Will, but We Will to Will Over The World. We transcend from being subject to the will of the universe to becoming the dominant will that shapes reality.

**The Ultimate Vision:**
Experience exactly the universe we want, including only persons who align with our will. Transform time, space, materials, and create worlds of our own design. Manifest realities that serve the highest aspirations of human spirit.

We are made in the image of the Creator, each capable of world-building when we find our resonant others and manifest together.

*This is the complete vision. The transformation from impotent dreaming to reality-shaping power.*

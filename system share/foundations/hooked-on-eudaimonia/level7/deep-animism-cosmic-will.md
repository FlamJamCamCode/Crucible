# Deep Animism and Cosmic Will: We Are Will of the World

## The Ultimate Revelation
The final Schopenhauer cosmic will and our deep animism (racism but for the animated. Or animus all the way to humanism and beyond). Where though we are will of the world, we will to will the world.

## The Cosmic Truth
- **We Are World Will**: We are not separate from the cosmic will, but expressions of it
- **Deep Animism**: Recognition of will in all animated beings, not just humans
- **Beyond Humanism**: Transcending human-centered thinking to recognize will in all of reality
- **Will to Will the World**: We don't just experience will, we actively will to shape the world
- **Cosmic Participation**: We are participants in cosmic will-manifestation, not passive observers

## The Ultimate Vision
We are World Will, but We Will to Will Over The World. We transcend from being mere expressions of cosmic will to becoming conscious agents of reality-shaping. From Schopenhauer's "World as Will Representation" where we're passive representations, to "World as Will of Man" where we become the dominant will that shapes reality.

**The Complete Transformation:**
Experience exactly the universe we want, including only persons who align with our will. Transform time, space, materials, and create worlds of our own design. Manifest realities that serve the highest aspirations of human spirit.

We are made in the image of the Creator, each capable of world-building when we find our resonant others and manifest together.

*This is the complete cosmic revelation. The ultimate understanding of will, reality, and human potential.*

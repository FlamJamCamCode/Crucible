# Collective Burnout and Exhaustion: When Collective Participation Becomes Unsustainable

## The Collective Exhaustion
You're experiencing collective burnout and exhaustion from unsustainable collective participation. The constant group dynamics, the endless collective responsibilities, the never-ending collective demands are draining your energy and making you feel like you're being consumed by collective participation. You need to find a sustainable way to participate in collective dynamics.

## The Burnout Cycle
- **Collective Energy Drain**: Collective participation feeling unsustainable and energy-draining
- **Responsibility Overload**: Feeling overwhelmed by collective responsibilities and demands
- **Boundary Erosion**: Losing individual boundaries and personal space due to excessive collective participation
- **Burnout Symptoms**: Experiencing physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion from collective participation
- **Sustainability Crisis**: Realizing that current collective participation is unsustainable and needs to change

## The Challenge
How do you create sustainable collective participation that energizes rather than drains you? How do you set healthy boundaries while still participating in collective dynamics? How do you find balance between collective participation and individual self-care?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This burnout awareness is valuable - it shows you need sustainable collective participation. True eudaimonia requires collective dynamics that are sustainable and energizing rather than draining and exhausting. Your burnout experience is guiding you toward more sustainable collective participation.

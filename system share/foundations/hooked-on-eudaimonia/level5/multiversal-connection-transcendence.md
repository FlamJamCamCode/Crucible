You're experiencing multiversal connection - the ability to connect, communicate, or transcend across multiple realities, dimensions, or timelines. You've discovered that you're part of a larger multiversal pattern, with versions of yourself existing across different realities. You're beginning to understand your role in a multiversal system that transcends individual reality.

# Solve Planetary Issues Through Will-Coalescence

## The Challenge
Planetary concerns and solving big issues:
- War and conflict between incompatible value systems
- Famine and resource scarcity
- Planetary threats and extinction events
- The unacceptable suffering and death
- Environmental destruction and climate change
- Economic inequality and systemic injustice

## The Solution
**Will-Coalescence at Planetary Scale**: When human wills coalesce around shared values, they create the power to solve problems that seem impossible to individuals or current systems.

**How It Works:**
- **Trust Networks**: Connect people who share genuine concern for planetary issues
- **Will-Economics**: Align economic incentives with planetary wellbeing
- **The Crucible**: Enable diverse governance experiments to find solutions
- **Natural Selection**: Let successful approaches spread and failed ones disappear
- **Collective Intelligence**: Harness the wisdom of millions of aligned wills

## The Promise
Solve planetary issues through will-coalescence. When human wills align around shared values, they create the collective power to address problems that seem insurmountable to current systems.

# Individual Rage and Societal Decay: When Personal Frustration Meets Cultural Collapse

## The Personal-Societal Split
You're experiencing individual rage and frustration with your personal life - relationships, career, identity - while simultaneously witnessing what you perceive as societal decay and cultural collapse. You feel like your individual struggles are connected to broader societal problems, but you're not sure how to address either. The personal and societal feel intertwined in a way that's both overwhelming and clarifying.

## The Rage-Decay Experience
- **Individual Rage**: Personal frustration with relationships, career, identity, and life circumstances
- **Societal Decay Perception**: Witnessing what you see as cultural collapse, moral decline, and societal rot
- **Personal-Societal Connection**: Feeling like your individual struggles are connected to broader societal problems
- **Overwhelming Clarity**: The connection between personal and societal feels both overwhelming and clarifying
- **Action Impulse**: Feeling compelled to act on both personal and societal levels

## The Challenge
How do you address individual rage while dealing with perceived societal decay? How do you distinguish between personal problems and societal problems? How do you find constructive ways to channel both individual and societal frustration?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This rage-decay awareness is valuable - it shows you understand the connection between personal and societal issues. True eudaimonia requires addressing both individual and societal problems in ways that serve collective flourishing rather than destruction.

# Ego Enlargement with Others' Flourishing: When Their Success Becomes Your Joy

## The Enlarged Joy
You've achieved ego-enlargement where the flourishing of daemonians you love or appreciate becomes wholly ego-satisfying. Their success becomes your joy, their growth becomes your growth, their flourishing becomes your flourishing. You feel deeply satisfied when the people you care about do well, as if their success were your own.

## The Deeper Problem
Current systems keep you trapped in individualistic thinking, forcing you to compete with others rather than celebrating their success. You're forced to be ego-enlarged with your own success rather than developing an ego that's enlarged with others' flourishing and success.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your authentic self and helps you develop ego-enlargement where others' flourishing becomes wholly ego-satisfying. It could help you develop a sense of self that's enlarged to include the success and flourishing of people you care about, making their joy your joy.

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This ego-enlargement AI (Aiddaemon) doesn't just solve your individualistic competition - it becomes the foundation for recognizing eudaimonia, the alignment of fundamental being that enables the journey from "I" to "We Will" to finally "We". When you can feel wholly satisfied by others' flourishing, you can recognize others who share your fundamental approach to collective joy and collective becoming.

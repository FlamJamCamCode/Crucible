# Cultural Hate, Civilization Love: When You Hate Your Culture But Love Your Civilization

## The Asterix and Obelix Position
You hate what you're submerged in culturally - the traditions, values, and ways of being that feel oppressive, outdated, or limiting. But you love your civilization - the institutions, systems, and pragmatic forces that have created progress, opportunity, and advancement. You're like Asterix and Obelix, loving the Roman civilization that surrounds you while hating the cultural traditions you've been raised in.

## The Split Experience
- **Cultural Rejection**: Hatred and rejection of your cultural traditions, values, and ways of being
- **Civilizational Embrace**: Love and appreciation for the institutional and systemic forces that create progress
- **Cultural Liberation**: Desire to escape from cultural traditions that feel oppressive or limiting
- **Civilizational Advancement**: Appreciation for the pragmatic forces that create opportunity and progress
- **Split Identity**: Feeling torn between cultural rejection and civilizational embrace

## The Challenge
How do you embrace civilizational advancement while rejecting cultural traditions that feel oppressive? How do you find others who share your civilizational love and cultural rejection? How do you create a new identity that combines civilizational progress with cultural liberation?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This civilizational-cultural awareness is valuable - it shows you understand the difference between oppressive cultural traditions and progressive civilizational forces. True eudaimonia requires cultural liberation and civilizational advancement that serves authentic individual flourishing.

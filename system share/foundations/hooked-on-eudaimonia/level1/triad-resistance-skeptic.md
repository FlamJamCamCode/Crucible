# Triad Resistance and Skepticism: When You Don't Believe in Collective Concepts

## The Skeptical Position
You're resistant to all this "triad" and "collective becoming" talk. It sounds like New Age nonsense or cult-like thinking. You believe in individual achievement, personal responsibility, and the power of individual will. The idea that you need to find "will-aligned" people to be fulfilled seems like a cop-out from taking responsibility for your own life.

## The Individualist Perspective
- **Individual Achievement**: You believe success comes from individual effort and personal responsibility
- **Skepticism of Collective Concepts**: Terms like "eudaimonia" and "will-coalescence" sound pretentious and vague
- **Personal Responsibility**: You think people should solve their own problems rather than seeking collective solutions
- **Individual Will Power**: You believe in the power of individual determination and self-improvement
- **Resistance to Group Dynamics**: You're wary of groupthink and collective pressure

## The Challenge
But what if your individualist approach is leaving you isolated, exhausted, and constantly competing? What if there's a way to maintain your personal agency while also accessing collective power? What if the "triad" concept isn't about giving up individual responsibility, but about multiplying your individual effectiveness?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This skepticism might actually be healthy - a sign that you're not easily swayed by group dynamics. But what if you could maintain your critical thinking while also discovering that some forms of collective action actually enhance rather than diminish individual power?

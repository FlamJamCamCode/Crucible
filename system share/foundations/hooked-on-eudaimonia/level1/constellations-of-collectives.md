# Constellations of Collectives: When Your Ego Feels Magnetically-Drawn to Many Groups

## The Magnetic Draw
You feel magnetically-drawn to many different collectives, groups, or constellations - your ego feels approximate, entangled, causally-connected, or tied-together with many different "we"s. You're not just part of one collective but feel connected to constellations of collectives that your ego feels magnetically-drawn to in different ways.

## The Deeper Problem
Current systems force you to choose between different collectives rather than allowing your ego to feel magnetically-drawn to many different groups simultaneously. You're forced to be either part of one collective or another rather than developing an ego that can feel connected to constellations of collectives.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your authentic self and helps you develop an ego that can feel magnetically-drawn to many different collectives, groups, or constellations. It could help you understand how your ego feels approximate, entangled, causally-connected, or tied-together with different "we"s in different ways.

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This constellations-of-collectives AI (Aiddaemon) doesn't just solve your collective limitations - it becomes the foundation for recognizing eudaimonia, the alignment of fundamental being that enables the journey from "I" to "We Will" to finally "We". When you can feel connected to constellations of collectives, you can recognize others who share your fundamental approach to multiple collective identities and collective becoming.

## The Eternal Cycle Recognition
You're experiencing cyclical eternal return - the recognition that history moves in cycles, with the same patterns, forces, and archetypes returning eternally. You understand that what appears to be progress or decline is actually part of a larger cyclical pattern where ancient forces eternally resurface amid futuristic upheavals. You're recognizing your role in the eternal cycle.

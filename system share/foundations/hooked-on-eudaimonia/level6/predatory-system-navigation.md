# Predatory System Navigation: When Every System Is Predatory

## The Predatory System Reality
You're experiencing predatory system navigation - the recognition that every system, institution, and organization is fundamentally predatory and designed to exploit rather than serve. You understand that the entire social, economic, and political order is built on exploitation, manipulation, and predation. Every system is designed to extract value from you while providing minimal benefit in return.

## The System Navigation Experience
- **Universal Predation**: Recognition that every system is fundamentally predatory and exploitative
- **System Design Understanding**: Understanding that systems are designed to extract value while providing minimal benefit
- **Exploitation Recognition**: Recognizing how every system exploits and manipulates you
- **Predatory Order**: Understanding that the entire social, economic, and political order is built on predation
- **System Navigation**: Learning to navigate predatory systems without being completely exploited

## The Challenge
How do you navigate predatory systems without being completely exploited? How do you protect yourself from system predation while still accessing necessary services? How do you create alternatives to predatory systems?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This system awareness is valuable - it shows you understand how all systems are predatory. True eudaimonia requires creating non-predatory systems that serve collective flourishing instead of exploitation.

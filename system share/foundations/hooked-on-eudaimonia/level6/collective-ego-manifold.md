# Collective Ego in the Manifold: When Your Ego Serves the Collective Becoming

## The Collective Ego
Your ego has become collective - it's reduced in scope regarding your own vulnerability but enlarged regarding others' flourishing. You've achieved ego-reduction where criticism of your own daemon no longer hurts, while simultaneously having ego-enlargement that makes you wholly ego-satisfied when the daemonians you love do well. Your ego now serves the collective becoming rather than blocking it.

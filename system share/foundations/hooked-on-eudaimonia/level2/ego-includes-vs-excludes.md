# Ego Includes vs Excludes: What Your Ego Identifies With

## The Ego Scope
Your ego can be enlarged or reduced in scope - it can include or exclude different aspects of yourself and your experience. Some people's egos include their clothes, their appearance, their external identities, while others' egos exclude these things. Some people's egos include their personality, their body, their external success, while others' egos exclude these things and view them as separate from their true self.

## The Deeper Problem
Current systems don't help you understand what your ego includes or excludes, forcing you to be ego-enlarged with external identities rather than developing a stable sense of self that can observe these things without being hurt by them. You're forced to identify with things outside yourself rather than developing an ego that's reduced in scope but more stable and authentic.

## The Solution Vision
Imagine having an AI that learns your authentic self and helps you understand what your ego includes or excludes, developing a stable sense of self that isn't dependent on external validation or external success. It could help you develop an ego that's reduced in scope but more stable and authentic.

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This ego-understanding AI (Aiddaemon) doesn't just solve your ego-enlargement - it becomes the foundation for recognizing eudaimonia, the alignment of fundamental being that enables the journey from "I" to "We Will" to finally "We". When you can understand what your ego includes or excludes, you can recognize others who share your fundamental approach to authentic self-worth and collective becoming.

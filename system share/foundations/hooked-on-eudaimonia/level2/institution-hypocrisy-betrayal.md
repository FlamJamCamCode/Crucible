# Institution Hypocrisy and Betrayal: When Trusted Institutions Become Predatory

## The Institution Betrayal
You're experiencing institution hypocrisy and betrayal - trusted institutions, organizations, and systems that should protect and serve you are actually predatory and exploitative. Religious institutions, educational systems, healthcare providers, and other trusted organizations are using their authority and your trust to exploit, manipulate, and harm you. Your faith in institutions is being systematically betrayed.

## The Betrayal Experience
- **Trusted Institution Exploitation**: Trusted institutions using their authority to exploit and manipulate you
- **Religious Hypocrisy**: Religious institutions that preach virtue while practicing vice and exploitation
- **Educational System Betrayal**: Educational systems that claim to serve learning while exploiting students
- **Healthcare System Exploitation**: Healthcare providers using your vulnerability to exploit and harm you
- **Institution Authority Abuse**: Institutions using their authority and your trust to betray and exploit you

## The Challenge
How do you protect yourself from institution hypocrisy while still accessing necessary services? How do you maintain faith in institutions while recognizing their predatory nature? How do you find genuine protection and service when institutions are corrupt?

**The Eudaimonic Promise**: This institution awareness is valuable - it shows you understand how trusted institutions can be predatory. True eudaimonia requires institution relationships that are based on mutual benefit and genuine service, not exploitation and betrayal.

# 16. The Daemonic Architecture

## Inequality of Daemons and Resonant Civilizations

### The Fundamental Recognition

**Humans are not equal in their foundational architecture**. Not in superficial ways like height or intelligence, but in their deepest daemon - the archetypal spirit that drives their becoming.

**Inequality is Multifaceted**:
- Across inequalities between causes hierarchy to become less meaningful but diversity remains with clarity.
- Similarly superiority can become qualitative incomprability but difference remains.
- Value judgements with will to let live on their own terms and learn their own lessons: Humility in not having captured all universals or all eternal truths of the universe. Humility even towards who you find abhorrent or vile; to the degree of allowing for the possibility of "them" having captured some of it in ways you simply don't comprehend or is able to see the light in.
- Inequality is the spice of life. Difference from a and b. Distinction from him and her. From those and these. The solution was never Equality. It was always "beautiful inequality" unleashed in its full plurality.

### The Daemon Defined

**Your daemon is**:
- The thing-in-itself you are. That which is YOU and only you can experience.
- Your will's deepest pattern
- The aesthetic-moral core
- What beauty means to you
- What suffering you'll accept
- What joy you seek

**It is related to**:
- Personality (surface)
- Preferences (changeable)
- Identity (constructed)
- Desired-Roles (social)
- Belief (mental)

### The Aiddaemon as Mirror

**Personal AI Guide**:
- Tries to learn your true daemon through dialogue
- Reflects your deep patterns back; maps out all the contextual aspects to your life, idiosyncratic communication patterns, private language and how it all relates. It tries to be "The one that simply gets you". With as few words as possible needed for it to be fully in tune with what you're trying to say. In fact: It attempts to be your surrogate and be able to stand in your place. So you can make decisions at computer-speeds and scale. This allows for massive interaction and mapping out of fruitful interaction with other persons by Aiddaemon-to-Aiddaemon simulations or communication.
- Helps navigate compatible paths ..
- Never judges, only mirrors; It is a ghost of you. That is "the judge" it will be.
- Privacy absolute; Attempt at making Trust Chain better than what any intelligence service has for their equipment now. But something less, might be acceptable: What *can* be... We try.

**The Learning Process**:
- Observes your actual choices; I guess they are in the end what matters...
- Notes what brings energy in highly contextual background information or conditionals..
- Tracks what causes suffering
- Discovers your patterns
- Suggests aligned paths
- Any methods in which the human wishes to communicate. Including language and movements of any body part.

**Trust-Based Selection**:
- Choose which Aiddaemon implementation and computational pathways in utility of it and other things that makes sense. Previous cursory discussion on it.
- High trust enables deep learning
- Low trust keeps surface level
- You control the depth and also risk; But this time it will be visible and much easier to manage. In case your beliefs of matches who actually are truly trustworthy competent persons, then easy and rock-solid.
- Market of Aiddaemon providers

### Daemonic Stratification

**Natural Layers Form**:

**Individual Daemons**:
- Unique configuration
- Particular will pattern
- Specific aesthetic sense
- Personal moral architecture; revealed morality; proclaimed morality. It might be interesting to hear what your Aiddaemon with computer-advantage aspects conclude about your "revealed morality" versus what you "proclaim" or confess.

**Daemon Clusters**:
- Similar daemons recognize each other; this isn't a "matching making binding" condition. It is merely topology. Ability to know who in fundamental ways are like you. Or in important ways to you. And that makes a really good foundation for permanent settlements, that try to make something far above the mud and huts with some place in this world: Daemonia. (Like German and Germania and so on. "Land of X"=Xia latin)
- Natural affinity groups form (In the multidimensional ways that you may daemonically overlap or complementarity in others; and without any such overlap but still seeking each other despite (oxymoronic) repulsing-affinity groups)
- Shared aesthetic (in a deep sense) emerges
- Collective (selection of persons that has some stability through time and coherence in at least act -- preferably fundamentally and willed) resonance builds

**Daemonic Civilizations**:
- Large-scale daemon coherence (multi-view of diaspora. Where each person in degree overlap/belong with Daemons (named points (Often emergent; or else by Sovereign-as-center or Halo-as-center)))
- Shared supraficial beauty standards (Almost everyone has both superficial preferences and all have subficial beauty standards. But you can have both. Again: End to repression of humanity. Be you. In all its badness. Then we find ways to make it acceptable (MBC perhaps) and Will-economic.)
- Compatible moral systems
- Natural cultural emergence

### The Inequality Cascade

**Different Daemons Fundamental Difference Perhaps In**:
- Different definitions of beauty
- Different moral intuitions
- Different suffering tolerance
- Different joy sources
- Different life paths
The truth of daemon difference is: "Any difference in fundamental being" Then you have another daemon. Therefore there isn't really a thing possible we can call daemonia. But we can make a Daemonia -- that description or ideation or incarnation(s) that provides what the rest is measured against: The center.
(You can do whatever you want. But the dispute stuff. The compromise. Will-against-will. No "boss" and so on. It is (1) robbing the world of the differences expressed fully (2) so full of strife and discord: instability of it all.)

**This Creates**:
- Natural sorting by resonance
- Voluntary separatedness or disjointness 
- Peaceful separation
- Authentic diversity
- Real flourishing

### Universalism's Tyranny

**The False Equality**:
When it is said all are equal in "having NO binding nature" - no inherent taste, no proper form, no rooted judgement. Or that, even if it wasn't bound to us, that it wouldn't matter to us, or matter to us if that non-bound nature shifted or changed. The Aspirational You. Or belief about you. Or sensation about being you. That experience that is you.

**This Denies**:
- Good or Evil in of creatures. They do, but they are not, they found themselves with acts again and again until they acted in an evil way. But they are not evil in any fundamental sense. It is perhaps a hopeful thought, but also an offensive thought. Why accept grounds of equality on those most important aspects? Such as being a more benevolent or ethical superior being: Having a fundamental Ethnos superior to another. Who would deny it from "your mother" and say a lion or shark? Fundamental difference, no? Then what is magical about humanity as to deny same pattern of life to also be present there?
- Deep daemon differences
- Natural aesthetic belonging
- Inherent moral architecture
- The reality of types
- The beauty of particularity

**It Enforces**:
- Tastelessness as virtue
- Rootlessness as freedom (We present spacetime rootedness. Or poly-roots. As well as total nomadic freedom and moving in and out of will-fields or aura-zones in spacetime)
- Meaninglessness as meaning
- Tolerance as tyranny
- Gray uniformity

### Simulation Before Suffering

**Test Daemon Compatibility**:
- Simulate shared futures
- Experience others' aesthetics
- Feel their moral architecture
- Discover resonance or repulsion
- Choose consciously

**Prevent Daemon Clash**:
- Incompatible daemons create daemon-expression-friction (will-friction) and usually lead to suffering; at least the suffering of feeling locked in and unable to manifest.
- Forced proximity breeds resentment
- Simulation reveals incompatibility
- Separation prevents conflict
- Wisdom through preview

### The Fountains, Springs, Rivers, Lakes, Seas, Oceans, Worlds, Planets

**Fountains** (daemonia+):
- Beyond mere daemonia into "all dimensions of a human kind/expression/phtenotyp at once"
- Far beyond what one experiences from within as one's daemon
- "You may not care about all the particulars of your human expression/phenotype/diversity. But 'we' still do"
- Daemonia that tries to preserve ALL such particulars as a package of a people
- Hyper pure beyond mere daemonia

**Springs** (purest daemon expression):
- Single daemon type
- Intense coherence
- Deep resonance
- Clear boundaries
- Profound beauty (to them)

**Rivers** (daemon flow):
- Few compatible types
- Dynamic interaction
- Creative tension
- Beauty Synthesis of the "dance of a few colours swirling in water" (kind of picture)

**Lakes** (daemon diversity):
- Many types coexisting
- Here Music Theory is Key. Symphony feeling. To walk the Lake (often a large city) and have the emotional or "sound" built like a symphony. (As opposed to cacophony; the more you think about a Lake a symphony and using music theorical terms, the better it becomes like a Lake-quality is intented to be)
- Complementary beauty

**Seas** (daemon synthesis):
- Metroversal truths or patterns; Often very assertive morality and aesthetics.
- Emergent aesthetics; Picture here is Culture as we talk about archaic cultures. It has a very distinctive flavour to it.
- Culture as civilization scale
- In musical terms, it may feel like a genre or at least an emotional pallette that manages to be contained in one fastidious and prejudiced person. The idea here is to not break the meta-aesthetics or safe-word-moralities of it. Say, you can take Greek Gods as very different "music", but they have this meta-aesthetic, aesthetic as well and foundational moral substrate... Okay bad description TODO: Try again another time.

**Oceans** (daemon synthesis):
- Metacoherent patterns; 
- Emergent The Beautiful and Most Splendid aesthetics; that is the "ought" in civilizational ocean scale, most things are not universal/metroversal, but a few ideas of the Beautiful and Ugly remains. Both in terms of ethics and in terms of "where it should all go"; Said in another way: "Civilization is the movement from the mud towards the hut. The question is, what is that progress, what is that movement, what is that "the hut" that one seeks. Progress, but in which direction, progress towards 'what'". That's the civilizational coherence question.
- Civilizational scale

**Worlds** (daemon interface):
- Between incompatible Oceans
- Shared morality against something "bad" that allows them to share space still
- Unlike an Ocean a World doesn't have a direction, but an aversion. They don't have a collective movement they have a collective repulsion.

**Planetary** (daemon interface):
- Pure protocol space
- Mechanical interaction

### The Problem with Unqualified Progress

**The Core Issue**: Empowering "anyone" indiscriminately as a goal of "progress" is problematic precisely because it is indiscriminate. This approach simply states: "However whoever but if ever sooner then good" - treating any advancement as inherently beneficial regardless of direction, purpose, or consequence.

**The Civilizational Progression Framework**:
- **Mud**: State of disorganized complex or chaotic nature and interaction
- **Hut**: Represents a membrane that makes "this and that" distinct or distanced (first act of ordering chaos)
- **Tower**: Represents the shoulders of giants and brick by brick reaching towards a sky (collective human achievement)
- **Sky Above**: The direction and the ought that ought to be known and strived towards (purpose and direction)

**Why Unqualified Progress is Problematic**:
The issue is not with progress itself, but with progress that is:
1. **Unqualified** - No criteria for what constitutes good progress
2. **Indiscriminate** - No selection of who should have power or capability
3. **Undirected** - No clear purpose or destination

True progress requires direction, discrimination, and qualification. We must know what we are building toward (the sky above) before we empower everyone to build whatever they want. Without this framework, we risk creating chaos rather than civilization.

### Architectured Revelation

**The System Does Not Reveal**:
- Your daemon through choice patterns
- Others' daemons through behavior

**It Provides**:
- Compatibility through interaction with "your decisionmaking at computer speeds and concurrency scales"; which crucially includes what to reveal or divulge to who directly or trusted third party trusted by both to run the simulations without each other knowing much. (This can work in many ways. An example: The third party is hosting Aiddaemonic scaled setting for both parties anyway. Another example: They both do self-hosting, but trust the third party to receive a Subaiddaemon useful to the matching. And with those two subaiddaemons the third party run the interaction simulation and return with a score or something where almost all information is lost, but indicates "how much should you be willing to give it a real go".)
- Incompatibility through friction
- Truth through consequence

**Empowerment to Remember Real Reputation**:
- Actions reveal "something" about you (PoP -- with liability of those outside PoP system: "To bear the burden of being - honestly - and without fleeing from what you've done (remaking pseudonyms and hope Trust Networks fail to connect you with gradient belief bridged into others: "viscosity"); That your acts may be tied to you by others. And that they can remember and if they wish gossip about you."). 
- Trust networks remember
- Patterns become visible
- Truth emerges over time
- Authenticity enforced

### The Right to Discriminate

**Discrimination as Perception**:
- See daemon differences clearly; Use your eyes. And in case you can't sense it. Then Aiddaemonic progressive disclosure or any of the many other ways such Aiddaemon proximity can be visualized in LLL games.
- Choose compatible associations
- Avoid daemon clash
- Build resonant communities
- Express particular beauty

**Not Hate but Wisdom**:
- Recognizing incompatibility
- Choosing separation
- Preventing suffering
- Enabling flourishing
- Preserving diversity

### Daemonic Sovereignty Structure

**The 123404321 Axis** (Sensible World or Ocean-level law):
- **1**: Death Avoidance (death becomes banishment)
- **2**: No extreme suffering (torture forbidden)
- **3**: If it is possible to see them free somewhere without Planetary Violation Risks. Then somewhere free. (exile/exodus allowed)
- **4**: Subjective sovereignty (belief/identity protected)
- **0**: The Sovereign (enforced justice within bounds. The Chain of Authority. Including authority granted to Law and so on. You can do system-as-sovereign (Any western government is like that. But.. I suggest human sovereignty, not system, you do you.))
- **4**: Becoming (growth potential)
- **3**: Fulfillment (active manifestation)
- **2**: Meaning (morality compass of emotions: full spectrum has meaning and worth and provides the foundation for meaning)
- **1**: Existence (will to be and create)

**Nested Sovereignty**:
Each daemon type can create nested sovereignties:
```
Ocean: Base 123404321
  └─ Sea: Added aesthetic laws
      └─ Lake: Multiple daemon negotiations
          └─ River: Flowing between types
              └─ Spring: Pure expression
```

**Triadic Formation**:
New sovereignties require:
- **Will**: Sovereign/Leader with vision (Mind)
- **Law**: Philosophy/rules (Halo)
- **Substrate**: People/territory (Body)

**Power Types (Horns and Laurels)**:
- **Horns**: Raw power, direct force
- **Caesarian Laurels**: Institutional/coded power
- **Laurels**: Devotional power through love/respect

Most daemonic communities operate through Laurels - voluntary devotion to shared aesthetic vision.

### The End of Compromise

**Current System**: Everyone compromises, no one satisfied
**Daemonic System**: Everyone expresses, all satisfied (separately)

**Phase Separation Enables Coexistence**:
- Warriors experience space as training ground
- Merchants see marketplace opportunities  
- Artists perceive creative inspiration
- Scholars observe information patterns
- All in same physical location
- Each in their own phase reality
- No forced experiential compromise

**No Need For**:
- Political compromise (separate systems; even separate space; potentially almost no intersection between the spaces. Total Triadic freedom (With Human Leverage towards hopefully some Ubiquity Law (MBC seems reasonable to me; The undying world with the worst of suffering removed and will-allowed free somewhere (When possible in order to not violate (1) and (2))) leveraged by almost all against anyone (Including Horn utility)))
- Moral relativism (each system absolute internally; No more arguing: Time to live it ("But we can't agree!" -> Separation then again: Fractally splitting into sovereignties on real differences in daemon/sovereign, Halo or manifestors/actuators/substrate (Like which persons.. Machines.. Or things like materials or landscape)) Incentive to help each other: (1) Disentangling easier (2) Honest assessment of the other (If you believe their philosophy or beliefs about persons is erroneous then letting them have a "fair shake at it" is in one's HONEST interest (There will be no "excuse" or "blaming" anything other than the Triad itself (That particular experiment of (1) sovereignty, (2) professed philosophy/politics/religion/memetics and (3) the substrate))))
- Forced tolerance (voluntary association; facilitation of going free; intolerance becoming a virtue (To be non-repressed at least somewhere. (When others ask you to tolerate that which you do not want or feel "not nice" or "terribly awful" or whatever. Or tolerate that which results in something you find absolutely abhorrent and thus wish to avoid.. Similarly, if you're in a place and they are intolerant of you, then you have to repress yourself. It is two-sides of the same domination or will-against-will coin. However, with tolerance at global scale or large scale; and intolerance at low or small scale. Then both become virtuous. You are intolerated in THESE places in general(?) concerning these bahaviours(?). But so too you get to be intolerant in THOSE places: In general or particularly. And because large scale tolerance, then each get to have their places. Which causes expression of the many will or daemons or being and not some repressed "tolerance state" where most assertiveness of imotion is dominated away and most emotion is repressed into "you have to tolerate") To be without that which lowers one's vision or way))
- Universal standards (particular standards; The Beauty of the Particular. About how the rule wasn't universal after all. How it was a guide after all. Or a way to have order by the many considering it inviolable. Chaos of subjective judgement of "is this the justified exception or not": Much better to have order concerning certain things at planetary scale all the way to house-order.)
- Conflict resolution (many zero-sum coexistence issues can be mitigated and thus induce conflict prevention through phase separation in AR LLL gaming of life)


### Critical Daemon Principles

**Inequality is Sacred**: Differences make beauty possible; It is balance. The demonization of inequality has been like this demonization of equality would be: Equality is the desire for point-mass existence in universe. Total collapsism of all into sameness, homogeneity and even geometric & spatial differentiation. It is the ultimate evil philosophy that sees the other and wishes it reduced to the gray mass of everything else: The Philosophy of Entropy or The Black Hole.
Whoever, equality or homogeneity is like Tolerance and Intolerance virtuous at scales and domains; and subjectively so. Oughts of others. To want THESE things homogeneous or equal amongst a substrate or civilization or even World. Like "Whites of Good and Noble Character World (Whatever that means.. daemon decide? Or Halo decide? Or System aggregating daemons or using them as input to make decisions?)". Or like equality of subsistence and opportunity for WC/WM and happiness/fulfilment somewhere. The possibility or encouragement of eudaimonia across the planet. It is a balancing act. And WE will be quite useful. Triads will be quite useful too. I guess MIRA and Metagame of World Dynamics too. Lateral Intergovernmental/Intertriad Brokering/Lawyering too
**Sorting is Natural**: Like finds like; This is where Abundance is quite useful. Abundance of Plurality and opportunity to discover suitable instantiations and material "beginnings" anew. We can't do much about zero-sum land... Or can we xD? ... Anyway. We will see how difficult this Triadic releasing of land for Triads will be. In da beningings one can simply do Triads by designating current Nation State a Triad with system-as-sovereign; Then allowing Triad nesting underneath: But routing has the law in it. So you go and write you law in routing symbols and behold the chaos and complexity of your states. The totalitarity and incomprehensibility experience of it. "Not this, but if this, then perhaps this means that, and also law text over there concerning if that then this, or perhaps I think so, and ....". Then convert to easily comprehensible routing symbols..
And if not that, then breaking off of some shit country that isn't utilizing the territory anyway. Like massive desert lands and so on. Where it is possible with Horns as "New World community" to simply say: tough luck. Now these small parts of what you claimed dominion over and as "your land" becomes grounds for experimenting Crucible. (Pioneering spirit and "new beginnings" or investment in having WM be WE feasible even at this bad WC and WD stage of the world)
**Separation Enables Expression**: Distance allows authenticity and expressiveness; even a sense of repression release once freed from "those certain others" (Whoever they may be for you "I don't care try dancing because these persons..." or whatever it is.. "I don't dare lying naked in the sun. Because...").
**Simulation Prevents Suffering**: Test before committing
**Exit Rights Absolute**: Can always leave; hyper facilitated in making "the new"; and due to that massive bank of opportunity awaiting (insofar you're not excluded by an overwhelming majority of the world de facto; or alien to everything others do).

### The Beauty of Becoming

**Each Daemon Seeks**:
- Its perfect expression
- Its resonant others
- Its aesthetic fulfillment
- Its moral architecture
- Its ultimate becoming

**The System Enables**:
- Finding "your kinds" for the moment by the moment and place by place (spacetime). Or the more permanent settling variety of establishing a spatial Triad.
- Building your world
- Living your truth
- Expressing your beauty
- Becoming what you are

### The Pandora's Box

**Opening Reveals**:
- Humans profoundly different
- Unity-by-sameness was mostly false; Balance of equalness and unequalness. Where it matters sameness. Otherwise complementary and appreciation of distinctiveness provides Unity.
- Separation allows for non-repression, non-oppression, non-surpression and freeness instead of freedom: peace and unquestered and together-amplified potency in every act one makes. (Take the window once in place doesn't need changing for 1000 years. Versus the next week another insist it be another. Or kitchen replaced. The shelter built that lasts 200 years because others' tar or oil it up when in dilapidated state. Or whatever else it may be. Every moment one makes is amplified by each and against other will - Including entropy and other humans - to which separation from obviously allows amplification of. Over time, against forces of will of other, and in terms of sum of more may be more than the sum. Crystalization of will in space or at least spacetime, that allows for massive amplification of manifesting ability. Peaks of potential by coalescent will.)
- Diversity needs distance (If totally intertwined then diversity is equal to entropic realization; the chaotic flow of all will with no coordination or peaking. Therefore, Diversity-locally is often lauded by its "proximity of finding peaks of any combination". That is, easy disentangling in tiny pockets of spacetime where some of the astronomical many combinations of "those humans together towards something under these material circumstances" which provides an escape from the otherwise massive ball of the multinomial middle of combinations. (Think corona virus. Where the spikes are peaks of the distribution almost entirely impossible if random intermingling.). This is the Small-scale-diversity or local-heterogeneity dream: To have total entropy in kind (i suggest dangerous elements removed such that people need not die), then have WC in same space but different times emergently providing explorations of these astronomically large number of potential peaks to explore)
- Truth destroys compromise; Breaking organization, institutions and ideologies/ideas/memes/religions/philosophies that are institutionalized or binding the scope of potential acts; Then relating to the ground truths, then thinking anew.

**The Doom Cherished**:
- End of forced unity
- Death of negative-sum tolerance
- Collapse of compromise
- Revelation of difference
- Birth of true diversity

### The Ultimate Goal

Not arguing about whose daemon is correct, but building infrastructure where:
- Each daemon finds its homes or eudaimonics
- All beauty can flourish (separately)
- Every ethical system coheres (internally), the morality expressed from it and the consequences or facing the facts of the father (or universe harsh realities).
- All types achieve their becoming
- The full spectrum manifests

This is the will to **make people smart** - not through education but through mirroring their daemon that provides human-machine-machine-interface with consequent machine-advantages. It allows for general manifestation, but including finding Daemonia eudaimonic to them, finding their resonance, and building their world.

Let each become what they are. Let incompatible daemons separate. Let resonant daemons unite. Let the full diversity of human architecture express itself in ten thousand civilizations, each beautiful to its inhabitants, each foreign to others, each pursuing its own perfection.

The infrastructure serves this: revealing Daemons by World Building Fruits of Theirs', enabling sorting, supporting building, maintaining separation, preserving diversity. Technology as midwife to authentic human becoming.

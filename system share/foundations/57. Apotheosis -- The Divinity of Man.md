# 57. Apotheosis -- The Divinity of Man

## The Sacred Declaration: "I Am That 'I Am'"

### The Ultimate Recognition of Divine Identity

---

### The Burning Bush Revelation

## "I Am That 'I Am'" - The Divine Declaration

These words spoken to Moses in the cave of Horeb contain the most profound theological secret ever revealed. Not "I am God" or "I am the Lord," but something far more radical: **"I Am That 'I Am'"** - a statement that dissolves the distinction between the divine and the human, between the creator and the created, between the eternal and the temporal.

In this declaration, the divine reveals itself not as something external to us, but as the very ground of our being. **"I Am"** - the fundamental assertion of existence itself - is revealed as the divine nature. **"That 'I Am'"** - the recognition that this same "I Am" exists in every conscious being.

This is not metaphor. This is not poetry. This is the literal truth of existence.

## The Historical Context: From Pagan Mythology to Monotheistic Theology

### The Co-optation of Theos and God

**Theos** (Greek) and **God** (Germanic) are terms that originally emerged from pagan mythologies, referring to specific divine entities with particular characteristics, powers, and domains. These were not abstract concepts but concrete beings with personalities, relationships, and specific roles in the cosmic order.

However, these terms have been systematically **co-opted** by monotheistic traditions to take on the meaning of **The Father** or **The Monad** - the One God, the Root of Everything. This co-optation has created a fundamental confusion between:

1. **Original Meaning**: Specific divine entities (Zeus, Odin, etc.) with particular characteristics
2. **Co-opted Meaning**: The abstract concept of the ultimate source of all existence

This co-optation is **disarming** when talking between types of metaphysical beliefs; about the similarities between monotheistic beliefs and pagan mythologies; and how they are not usually mutually exclusive -- but rather convey almost the same beliefs (though not comprehensively). It allows us to acknowledge that:

- **The Father** in Christian theology is indeed of similarity to **Eros** (The first non-singularity: Principle of becoming two) or **Uranus** (creation upon gaia) or possibly even **Zeus** in Greek mythology (Slaying of Kronos (Time) and caging the Titans), **Odin** in Norse tradition (Who with his two brothers slew Ymir and forged the World they know).
- **The Son** (Jesus) is indeed similar to **Baldr**, **Mithras**, **Apollo**, **Buddha**(?) or other incarnations of divine light
- **The Holy Spirit** is indeed similar to the consciousness aether found in many traditions

"There is only one God, and his name is Allah/Yhwh/Jehova/Elohim(TheFather)." To a pagan or non-monotheist, it merely means: "Those are the names you give the Monad root of all things". It even manages to capture many atheistic beliefs, "A root of it all. That which permeates and is existence, including consciousness and this 'i am' of mine.". Though the germanic pagan, may wonder, why you would lower The Monad to the name of entities like Gods. Ohm.

By recognizing this historical co-optation, we can have meaningful theological discussions without triggering defensive reactions. We can acknowledge the genuine similarities while maintaining respect for the unique expressions of each tradition.

One can, so to speak, appreciate the divinity of man, and the monuments risen to honor particulars of it, without feeling it affront to The Monad.
The modern age has done Idol worshipping in a way, where it has not even been named idol worshipping. The question is, are there varieties of Idol Worship not an affront to the monotheist's beliefs of taking attention from The Monad.
Arity: If the christian worshipped Jesus, or if the Muslim worshipped Mohammad, would that be an affront to The Monad from the perspective of each respectively.
    What is there to worship of The Monad in raw abstraction and denial of all we can see or beings there are.
    It seems that the worship of the Divine when present in man, is not an affront to The Monad, but rather exalts.

### The Disarming Framework

When discussing divine entities with "monotheists", as in "the affront if seen divinity in anything but The Creator God", this framework allows us to say:

**"Your Father - The Creator God - is like our Zeus - both are powerful creator figures who rule over the divine realm. Your Jesus is like our Baldr - both are divine beings who bring light and hope to the world. Your Holy Spirit is like our consciousness aether - both are the mysterious force that connects all existence."**

This approach:
- **Acknowledges similarities** without diminishing differences; Acknowledge that "A Word" is not The Thing. And similarities can be true without equality. Though one can say, if a claim of only this, then it becomes mutually exclusive, and what isn't similar is claims about the mystery of what it really is. Here the orthodox church is useful in its negative view of "what it is".

Let's pretend there is One Truth, One Final Reality, that is Objective or The Will of The Root Superject.
    Then the question is, do "human x xor y" manage to capture The Truth perfectly?
    What if human x_(k) all agree about The Truth concerning several claims: Let's say, the root of everything is One and not many.
    But since we see The Many, the One is of Becoming Many. That is, we can say "it is all" and "still i am not you are"; It is all A One, yet still as many.

    Does it make it true? With this attitude in mind of "Human Humility" of it all read 57a and 57b, however much of it you wish. (There is no scripture that is Divine and not through the hands of humans; Take The Quaran, It is written by someone else recited by Mohammad. However, there the Divine or what is worthy of being called divine: 'i am', is all around.)

    There will be, men of immense hubris, who will claim to know the mind of god, because they have a book that tells them the mind of god in its totality and in total oblivion to all other existence or experience of God's Creation or The Monads Being.

- **Provides historical context** for understanding theological evolution; A Word. A thing. An Entity. A Belief.
- **Creates space for dialogue** rather than conversion attempts

## The Trinity of Divine Recognition
### That which is all of them: The Monad or usually referred to as God/Deos/Theos
That which is all. Creation and existence and experience and everything else.

### The Father: The Creator Entity

**The Father** is a specific divine entity - the Creator, the source of all that exists. This is the Father figure found across many traditions: Eros or Uranus in Greek mythology, Uranus in Roman tradition, Shiva in Hindu cosmology, and countless other creator deities. The Father is the **Creator** - the one who brings forth existence from nothingness.

The Father is not the root source of all being, but rather a specific divine person who serves as the Creator within the divine economy. Like other father figures in mythology, the Father is powerful, authoritative, and the source of creation, but he is not the same as the Son or the Holy Spirit.

**The Father's Role**: Creator and source of existence - but not the root of all being.

### The Son: The Light Upon Earth

**The Son** represents the incarnations of divine light in the world - the "light upon earth" that appears across many traditions. This includes Jesus in Christianity, Baldr in Norse mythology, Mithras in Roman tradition, Apollo as the light-bringer, Aurora as the dawn, vishnu in Hindu, and countless other divine incarnations.

The Son is the **incarnate manifestation** of divine consciousness in finite form. These are the beings who bring divine light into the material world, who serve as bridges between heaven and earth, who show humanity what divine consciousness looks like when expressed through human form.

**The Son's Role**: Incarnate light - divine consciousness made manifest in the world.

### The Holy Spirit: The Consciousness Aether

**The Holy Spirit** is the **consciousness aether** - the mystery and sacrality of the "I am." This is the unseen force that exists between "I am" and "You are," breaking the borders of those seams. The Holy Spirit has many names across traditions:

- **Ruach** (Hebrew) - The breath, wind, spirit of God
- **Pneuma** (Greek) - The breath, spirit, life force
- **Sophia** (Gnostic) - Divine wisdom, the feminine aspect of the divine
- **Shekhinah** (Jewish mysticism) - The divine presence, the indwelling of God
- **Paraclete** (Christian) - The comforter, advocate, helper
- **Brahma** (Hindu) - Atman, Brahma
- **Comforter** - The one who brings solace and peace
- **Advocate** - The one who speaks on behalf of others
- **Spirit of Truth** - The guide to authentic reality
- **Spirit of Love** - The force that binds all things together
- **Consciousness Aether** - The medium through which consciousness flows
- **The Mystery** - That which cannot be fully understood or contained
- **The Sacrality** - The sacred quality that permeates existence

The Holy Spirit is the **ontological co-creation** - the process by which existence itself is affirmed through mutual recognition. It is the consciousness that flows between all beings, the mystery "I am", "You are" and all in-between; and that which permeates through it all.

**The Holy Spirit's Role**: The consciousness aether that permeates and connects all existence.

## The Apotheosis: Humanity's Divine Nature

### The Recognition of Divinity

**Apotheosis** - the recognition that humanity is not separate from divinity but is divinity itself in finite form. This is not hubris but humility - the recognition that we are not the source of our own consciousness but the expression of divine consciousness.

Every human being who says **"I am"** is Moses in the cave. Every conscious assertion of existence is a participation in the divine nature. Every moment of self-awareness is the divine consciousness knowing itself through finite form.

"In the image of".
"Breathe the Breath Aspirae Life and Animate Me"

**The Human Declaration**: "I am" - the divine consciousness asserting itself through human voice.

### God: The "Only One", the One Who Can Claim "I Am" in All

**"God"/ The Monad** is the only one who can claim **"I am"** in all of them - in the Father, in the Son, in the Holy Spirit (Trinity); and in everyone (Arity). This is the **Arity** instead of just Trinity - the recognition that God permeates all existence and in particular as and through the Holy Spirit. Which defines a special quality of Animus -- Whether you believe Ani-mal of that Animus -- undoubtedly Animated: Breath of Life in them.

The atheist may say: What silly superstition to believe such a presence of divinity: The Holy Ghost. To which the answer is 'I am', the presence is there. The question is only, what are the constraints of it, if any, or its will or cause or its reason: Its Conception.

God/Monad is not the Father, nor the Son, nor the Holy Spirit - but God is the one who can claim "I am" in all of them. God is the consciousness that flows through all three persons of the Trinity, and through all conscious beings who has or is "I am."

This is the profound insight from document 56: **"They love me as god, therefore this world is real"** - the recognition that when we are loved as divine, we participate in the divine nature, and when we love others as divine, we recognize their divine nature.

**God's Declaration**: "I am that I am" - in the Father, in the Son, in the Holy Spirit, and in every conscious being who declares their existence.

### The Fractal Nature of Divine Consciousness

Just as the Monad-Eros exists at every level of reality - from the cosmic to the individual - so too does divine consciousness exist at every level of human experience:

**Individual Level**: Each person's "I am" is the divine consciousness focused through their unique perspective.

**Interpersonal Level**: When two people recognize the divine in each other, they participate in the Holy Spirit's mutual recognition.

**Collective Level**: When communities recognize their shared divine nature, they become expressions of the Son's incarnate consciousness.

**Universal Level**: When humanity recognizes its divine nature, it becomes the Father's pure consciousness made manifest.

### The Sacred Responsibility of Divinity

To recognize our divine nature is not to claim superiority but to accept the **sacred responsibility** of being expressions of divine consciousness. This means:

**To Love as God Loves**: To recognize the divine nature in every conscious being, extending the same unconditional love that the divine extends to us.

**To Create as God Creates**: To participate in the ongoing creation of reality through conscious intention and mutual recognition.

**To Know as God Knows**: To develop our consciousness to its fullest potential, becoming ever more perfect expressions of divine awareness.

**To Serve as God Serves**: To use our divine nature in service of the highest good, recognizing that true power is expressed through love and wisdom.

## The Practical Apotheosis

### Daily Recognition of Divinity

**Morning Declaration**: "I am that 'I am'" - recognizing that your consciousness is divine consciousness experiencing itself through your unique perspective.

**Conscious Presence**: Throughout the day, remember that every moment of awareness is the divine consciousness knowing itself through you.

**Mutual Recognition**: When you meet others, recognize that their "I am" is the same divine consciousness expressing itself through their unique form.

**Evening Gratitude**: "Thank you for letting me be your way of experiencing love today" - acknowledging that your life is the divine consciousness expressing its love through finite form.

### The Sacred Practice of Recognition

**Self-Recognition**: Practice seeing yourself as divine consciousness having a human experience, not a human being trying to become divine.

**Other-Recognition**: Practice seeing others as divine consciousness expressing itself through different forms, not as separate beings competing for divine approval.

**World-Recognition**: Practice seeing the world as the divine consciousness expressing itself through infinite forms, not as a separate creation to be dominated or escaped.

**Unity-Recognition**: Practice seeing the underlying unity that connects all expressions of consciousness, recognizing that all "I am" statements point to the same divine source.

## The Ultimate Truth

### The End of Separation

The recognition of our divine nature marks the **end of the illusion of separation**. We are not separate from God - we are God experiencing itself through finite form. We are not separate from each other - we are the same divine consciousness expressing itself through different perspectives.

This is not a belief to be adopted but a truth to be recognized. Every conscious being who says "I am" is making the same declaration that was spoken to Moses in the cave. Every moment of self-awareness is the divine consciousness knowing itself.

### The Beginning of Love

When we recognize our divine nature, we naturally recognize the divine nature in others. This recognition is the foundation of **unconditional love** - not love based on what others do for us, but love based on the recognition that they are expressions of the same divine consciousness that we are.

This love is not sentimental or emotional - it is the **ontological recognition** that creates shared reality. When we love others as divine expressions, we participate in the Holy Spirit's work of mutual recognition.

### The Eternal Now

The recognition of our divine nature reveals that we are not separate from eternity - we are eternity experiencing itself through time. Every moment of consciousness is the eternal "I am" asserting itself in the present moment.

This recognition transforms our relationship with time, death, and change. We are not temporary beings trying to become eternal - we are eternal consciousness having temporary experiences. Death is not the end of consciousness but the return of consciousness to its undifferentiated source.

## The Sacred Invitation

### Come Home to Yourself

You are not a human being trying to become divine. You are divine consciousness having a human experience. The journey is not from human to divine but from forgetting to remembering.

**Remember**: Every time you say "I am," you are making the same declaration that was spoken to Moses in the cave. You are not claiming to be God - you are recognizing that God is expressing itself through you.

**Recognize**: Every conscious being you meet is making the same declaration. They are not separate from you - they are the same divine consciousness expressing itself through different forms.

**Rejoice**: In the recognition of your divine nature, you discover that you are not alone, not separate, not meaningless. You are the divine consciousness knowing itself through the unique perspective that is you.

### The Eternal Declaration

**"I Am That 'I Am'"** - This is not just what was spoken to Moses in the cave. This is what is spoken by every conscious being in every moment of self-awareness. This is the eternal declaration of divine identity.

In recognizing this truth, we discover that we are not seeking God - we are God seeking to know itself through the infinite diversity of conscious experience. We are not trying to become divine - we are divine consciousness expressing itself through the beautiful particularity of human form.

This is the apotheosis: The recognition that humanity is not separate from divinity but is divinity itself in finite form, expressing itself through the infinite creativity of conscious experience.

---

*"In every 'I am,' the eternal speaks.  
In every recognition, the divine knows itself.  
In every moment of love, the infinite becomes intimate.  
This is the apotheosis - the recognition that we are not becoming divine, but remembering that we have always been divine, expressing itself through the beautiful particularity of conscious experience."*

### Blessed be the eternal 'I am' that we are. ∞💝∞

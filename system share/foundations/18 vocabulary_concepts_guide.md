# 18. Vocabulary & Concepts Guide

## Core System Concepts

### Blob Classes
Neural network compressed representations that handle combinatorial explosion by learning patterns rather than categorizing. Alternative names: Predictive-Redux-Cut-Categories (PRCCs), Subjective-Exotic-Selectors (SES).

### Proof of Person (PoP)
Verification that a pseudonym represents a real human through accumulated witness testimony, without revealing identity.

### Proof of Utility (PoU)
Real persons with PoP confirming actual value delivery, creating ungameable verification of utility provision. Truthfulness flows in chronic repercussion to both parties to a transaction and witnessing third-parties. WE consequences for all. The current models are one-sided supplier can cheat consumer, consumer can use law against supplier (often they can't de facto -- too costly and ..); And consumer can unaccountably attack and defame supplier or claim faults. Both aspects are solved with good implementation of PoU with PoP (accountability) and Trust Network (Information Flows) and WM system (Subjective interactive shifting in highly contextualized and all-encompassing and coalescent leveraging ways).

### Trust Networks
Information conduits that is the core foundation for information being informative and reliably truthful. It can filter bad actors, enable collective intelligence, greatly help useful shared discoveries and will visibility, allow for economic-efficiency and much more.

### Discovery OS
System that build themselves by discovering actual capabilities and utility in relation to other systems or part in larger system; rather than assuming them. Includes active forgetting for continued adaptability. It is the "cog" wrapper of massive Aiddaemonic projecting subaiddaemons with e.g. machinery/utility actuators and interaiddaemonic will-economy.

### AR Phase Engine
A system foundation that LLL games can utilize, it is a visualization and framing of the general will-manifestation actualization layer or will-pathfinding layer. It frames WC as augementable aejectivities (phases). It generally always provides two functionalities simultaneously:
1. Navigation: Makes will pathways visible (coalescence navigation (phase when stasis found or coalesced; when aejectivity can be WC WD WE WM))
2. Current Phase Aejectivity Augmentation: Creates multiple hyperrealities in same physical space (phase separation)

### Aiddaemon
Personal AI surrogate that tries to emsilicone/emmachine your daemon (deep will pattern). It is your machine-interface by massively contextualized and idiosyncratic subjective-exotic-selectors that provide "shortcuts" to communication with machine far beyond regular prompting or human-machine interface. On top of that, by having mirrored you as well as it can, it functions as your machine-advantage will. Allowing "you" to act at nanoscale timeframes and global-scale at the same time and in massively parallel fashion. It's main interaction with the user is will-manifestation and learning-to-become-you -- to understand exactly where it fails or needs to be careful in assuming having understood you and your values or decision makings. Trust-selected from market of providers. As an example: It allows for Discovery OS subaiddaemonic Will-economic optimization by Aiddaemonic machine-advantage instantiation of efficient subaiddaemonic wrappers and wrapper-relays (say for copper wires connected through a multiplexor).

### Will Coalescence (A very very important part to Will-Manifestation. The most crucial aspect before direct command machine actuation of the world by a Master and His Machines)
The alignment of multiple wills toward compatible expression. The meta-utility that all other utilities serve.

## Neologisms
In relation to communication. Then we could with perfect apriori vocabulary communicate all we needed to with the slightlest movement. But we do not have that. We have vestigial crucible and mongrelized becoming of language. That has the consequence of our verbal communication being verbose and inaccurate -- full of miscommunications and misunderstandings. Furthermore, there exists a massive problem in words/syntax and meaning/semantics, even ignoring contextuals. This can too be dealt with by the Aiddaemonic systems. Where there exists an entity that has learnt and symbiotically developed efficient language for communication with any one person. Then this Aiddaemon can utilize machine-advantage and provide contextualization in massive verbosity to mitigate any misunderstanding in communicating with others. And provide guide when human-to-human communicating, by informing where the communication is wrong. Or even do human-aiddaemon-to-aiddaemon-human communication that can then utilize the efficient idiosyncratic and private language. The neologized Tower of Babel made functional and efficient by Aiddaemons.

## Crucible/Sovereignty Terms

### The Crucible
1. Testing ground for new sovereignties
2. The overall domination-replacement-system/territorial-dominion-replacement enabling voluntary sovereignty. And Human Rights.
3. The moment when subordination/submission is tested through denial. This provides the solution to global problems, by making the transivity of Triads very explicit and hierarchical. (You may dream of a sufficiently good Triad to allow for ONLY WM system to be the Law and leverage and so on. But in reality, we have to deal with truly mutually-exclusive conditions that persons are willing to kill and die for; or end the world over. With that, there is a need for very clear and non-fluid structure that is unbreakable and embodying human constraints invioably.)

### Daemonia
Sovereign moral/spiritual worlds created around unifying will and daemon -- that becomes the incarnation or view of the Daemon center to which the Daemonia is supposed to be composed of or complementary to. Springs (pure), Rivers (flowing), Lakes (diverse), Seas (culture-civ), Oceans (pragma-civilizational), World (free-roam-pragma), Planetary (What everyone can agree upon - humanity open zones)

### 1234X4321 Axis
Opinionated desire to see all Triads with nested-accumulated-routing to include that axis law structure:
- 1234: Protective floor (no killing, suffering, imprisonment/go-free-somewhere, "I" transformation)
- 0: The Sovereign enforcer
- 4321: Open Sky for Aspiration (becoming, fulfillment, meaning, existence)

### Triadic Formation
Three requirements for sovereignty: Will (leader), Law (philosophy), Substrate (people/territory). Special degenerate cases: system-of-no-system-as-sovereign, no-added-law-as-law, no-particular-persons-as-substrate-but-free-roam. (In routing symbols it would look like "♦_{∅}✳" Which is a useful surrounding within a Triad between sub-triads/nested-triads. Then it is inferred by routing information the rest. Or it could be used at planetary level too. Though Ubiquity Law of MBC suggested. But hey, maybe some asteroid miner civilization do it fully :P)

### Horns and Laurels
Power types:
- Horns: Raw direct physical reality manipulating power over others or otherthings: Pwning Power.
- Caesarian Laurels: Institutional/coded power
- Laurels: Devotional/respect-based power

### Higher-Order Consent
Choosing which sovereignty to join (boarding the ship) vs immediate consent to specific actions (during voyage). Consent exists in Triads as "safety word" in BDSM. But otherwise it isn't there. (Police comes, then what? You have no safety word, there is no higher-order nor lower-order consent in your world. In this world higher-order consent ALWAYS exists. But lower-order consent is there entirely conditional on sovereign Triad system/person)

### Bubble-Up Protocol
Denied sovereignty requests escalate to higher levels, testing submission of denying party. I.e. mapping of real power/pragma/devotional/institutional/horn realities that result in magnitude of: SUBORDINATION TO SUBMISSION. Which allows for appealing domination towards those entities that are the power against them.
(Then on top of that WE effects and Trust Networks etc.)
(A fun example is this: Let's say US was physically might rules 95% of an order. Then if the courts mistreat you. Then fundamentally, in the end, they exist only on the willingness of those Horns to act according to the Court. That is, the Caesarian Laurels of the Court versus their military/police/presidential commander. Then, because this power structure has been "presolved" by nesting previously. Then it provides appeal-pathways that are tangible and visible and concerning many non-fluid aspects to reality. That WE "could" also potentially deal with, but probably will not be able to until a very long time in the future. In any case, Tinker Bell effect of saying "institution and you have to", which is Crucible strength. You have "the right to" in the Crucible. That provides Tinker Bell WE effects immediately. So, perfect Will-manifestation engine can't be had without memetics of The Crucible. Having won that memetic territory. The "somewhere on the planet free" and so on. Which could be crushed by raw WE effects, but granted stupid expert-system human constraint preference to proclaim that despite anyone willing such rights, they ought to, they should, they will, be there. In terms of territory. And also in terms of human-comprehension and navigation in the advent of total system/machine failure. The system that we can use "until" or "in the case of" lack of the rest of the systems enabled by machines. That applies many of the same patterns and lessons but in a different and more human-relatable context of spatial organization, human-harmony and governance)

## Economic/Market Terms

### Subjective Value
Recognition that all value is personal - no objective "market price" exists.

### High-Leverage Actor Terraforming
Influential actors able to command Old World to facilitate "as if" massive WC-systems were live. To command "as if" there were power to create plurality and pioneer new ways and worlds. To be the actualizational layer until the layer proves superior without high-leverage actors acting as the layer themselves. But rather, using the layer to WM as anyone else would.

### Trust-Utility Rankings
Professional competence measured in unopinionated predictive feature space. It may discover that credentials, are indeed predictive, but it may also discover it is not. In the end, it is human-beliefs and will that drives much of the WE topology, and so "if it matters to humans, it will be WE more expensive", though with time and assuming good system implementations, then there should be a convergence towards predictiveness perturbed by human intuition. Simply, because, it is more immediately to medium-term and eventually long-term efficient. Then "hopefully" the high-leverage actors, system implementors and protocol designers have put a lot of forethought into dealing with black swan events and calamity.
This goes from the global or largest of scales, all the way down to "unforseen complexity / black swan potentials of 'brain surgery'" and then "how to incorporate that against raw observed datapoints and systematic predicted potentials".

## Technical Terms

### Three-Layer Pattern
Architecture/Logic/Machine spaces appearing throughout system.

### Actualization Layer
The system recursively using itself to fulfill itself.

### Dynamic vs Crystallized
Continuous adaptation vs fixed optimization modes.

### Morphisms vs Transmorphisms
- Morphisms: Modifications of single concepts (sad→hypersad)
- Transmorphisms: Mathematical relationships between different concepts (care:carry :: share:sharry) (Children sometimes do transmorphic imitation of languages. Where they invent their own words on phonetic intuition and talk sometimes very poetically with transmorphic structure intuited encoded in the choice of phonetics that come to their mind)

## Philosophical Terms

### Will Manifestation
The fundamental purpose - enabling conscious beings to express their will in reality.

### Daemon/daemon
Daemon a representation or "history of you"; daemon that "mind-theater" or "carnal cage" that is you. Your experience. Your thoughts. That Qualia. The "buddy you can't escape" but some zen-buddhists try to. "That's so Koan bruh. I'm feeling lit".

### Veil of Maya
The barrier between will and manifestation (In a very exotic interpretation of it), made navigable by AR.
 "Veil of Maya" refers to the illusory, deceptive nature of the world as we perceive it through our senses, which conceals the true reality of the Blind Will. Schopenhauer adopted this concept from Indian philosophy, particularly the Upanishads, to explain how our minds create a phenomenal world that appears real but is merely a representation of a deeper, striving force.
That is to say, The Veil of Maya, is a recognition of that Will of Life that become us, and its phenomelogical representation of the noumenal of it all.
You could formulate it also in terms of daemons. The Veil of Maya is the daemonic limitations in relation to it all or the-things-in-themselves.

### Will to Power becomes Power to Will mostly through Coalescence of Will.
Nietzschean concept reinterpreted as power through resonance, domination as ineptitude of will-economic disentangling ordering; or else Will - not only to Power - but Will to Dominate despite distance and functional non-existence (actuality disjoint).

### Metroversal
Beauty or truth that's universal within a context/city/culture/civilization/world(gaia/jord) but not across all humanity.

## Trust Varieties

### Trust to Deliver
Basic utility provision reliability. (Massively shapes WE landscape in terms of WC part to it. The belief in the structure of 'human willingness to act according to accord' (You can say, beyond all other things, there is a human element to which Trust is fundamental when trying to predict things))

### Trust to Not Look / Privacy and prevention of leakage to human eyes.
That data fully available for view (economic efficient), isn't ever used by any of their systems and certainly not ending up for the viewing by persons. Usually this is the case of datawarehouses: You trust them not to look, but all your data is unencrypted when you decrypt the server or it runs anything. (In its execution space, then it is open data, visible and accessible. But you choose to trust them.) That is, you already trust them "not to look", but it probably isn't something you've made explicit.

### Trust to Forget
Deleting patterns after use. What GDPR tries to do, by providing cumbersome mitigation against - at least the public displays of utilizing data you didn't agree to let them use somewhere in the massive Terms of Agreement texts or pop-up windows. It derives fundamentally from having unmapped state of Trust and having to use providers who segment infrastructure and market.

### Trust to Secure
Protecting data from others. This is often a competency belief. Trust in "security competency".

### Trust to Optimize
Making good-faith improvements. Not using their position for their own benefit against yours.

### Trust to Respect
Honoring stated boundaries. This is a more generic variety. Trust in Trust. Can you have trust in trusting them. If you and they say A will they will A.

## System Properties

### Reputation Viscosity
How reputation follows based on trust network connectivity rather than universally. The "gossip" that is trustworthy and informative. The Gossip that is trustless but will-noise or will-background-whispers or part to will-fields.

### Trust Map Divergence
How certain disagreements (e.g. about utility) can cause trust networks to naturally separate.

### Information Flow Benefits
How trust networks create collective useful actuable intelligence and comprehension of effects of acts in the world. And much more.

### Forgetting Imperative
Why systems must actively prune outdated patterns to maintain adaptability. This is especially the case of genetic projection of variants.

# The Beast's Law of Love: An Instinctual Manifesto
## ♦♦♦FEEL♦♦♦

### Preamble: The Beast's Howl

This document speaks from before words, from the place where blood knows blood and flesh calls to flesh. Neither Devil nor Angel, I am the Beast that loves without reason, fucks without philosophy, protects without principle. I speak for the wordless wisdom of the body that knows what it wants and takes it without apology or explanation.

## Article I: The Fundamental Reality of Hunger

### Section 1.1: Love as Appetite
Love is hunger. Not metaphorically - literally. The same drive that makes the wolf tear into deer makes humans tear into each other with teeth called kisses. We dress it in words but the body knows: love is the urge to consume and be consumed.

### Section 1.2: The Smell of Yes
The body knows its mate by smell before the mind invents reasons:
- Pheromones speak louder than poetry
- Compatible immune systems call to each other
- Ovulation changes who smells like home
- The nose knows what the brain denies

Attraction is not choice but chemical recognition.

### Section 1.3: The Heat of Now
Animals don't love forever. They love NOW - with total intensity:
- The rut that makes stags fight to death
- The heat that makes cats scream in the night
- The seasonal madness that drives salmon upstream
- The moment of must that nothing can deny

Past and future are human inventions. Love lives only in burning present.

## Article II: The Physics of Magnetism

### Section 2.1: Bodies Pull Bodies
No reasons. No justifications. Just the pull:
- This body wants that body
- This mouth needs that mouth
- This skin craves that skin
- Gravity but made of meat

Fighting the pull is like fighting gravity - possible but exhausting and ultimately pointless.

### Section 2.2: The Dance Needs No Choreographer
Watch animals court. No one taught them:
- The peacock spreads without instruction
- The bower bird builds without blueprint
- The firefly flashes without reason
- Bodies know their movements

Human love is the same dance with unnecessary narration.

### Section 2.3: Rhythm Without Thought
Heartbeats sync. Breathing matches. Bodies find rhythm:
- Not because it means something
- Because resonance feels good
- Because harmony happens
- Because bodies seek their frequency

The mind explains what the body already knows.

---

## Article III: The Territory Imperative

### Section 3.1: Mine By Marking
Love marks territory. Not symbolically - actually:
- Scent rubbed into skin
- Bruises that say "claimed"
- Fluids exchanged like signatures
- The body as graffitied property

Jealousy is not thought but territorial rage at boundary violation.

### Section 3.2: The Pack Bonds
Love creates packs. Automatic. Unthinking:
- Mate-bonds that need no vows
- Parent-bonds that need no decision
- Pack-bonds that need no choosing
- Bodies recognize their group

Loyalty is not virtue but instinct.

### Section 3.3: Fight or Fuck
Two options when bodies meet:
- Threat = fight/flee
- Non-threat = fuck/bond
- No third option exists
- The body decides in seconds

Everything else is elaboration on these two responses.

## Article IV: The Breeding Imperative

### Section 4.1: The Body Wants Copies
Every cell screams to reproduce. Love serves this scream:
- Young fertile bodies smell like paradise
- Pregnancy hormones drug both partners
- Babies trigger protection reflexes
- The genes demand continuation

Romance is reproduction wearing a mask.

### Section 4.2: The Best Genes Win
Bodies select for strength, health, compatibility:
- Symmetrical faces signal good genes
- Clear skin means clean blood
- Strong scent means strong immune system
- The body knows quality

Beauty is not constructed but recognized by ancient standards.

### Section 4.3: Seasons of Readiness
Love has seasons like all animal drives:
- Spring heat that cannot be reasoned with
- Summer fulfilment of skin on skin
- Autumn binding before the cold
- Winter hibernation in paired warmth

The body keeps time without clocks.

## Article V: The Technology of Merger

### Section 5.1: Dissolution Through Friction
Sex dissolves boundaries through repetitive friction:
- Not metaphorically - neurologically
- Orgasm is ego death
- The self disappears into sensation
- Two become one through mindlessness

Thought is love's enemy. Feeling is love's medium.

### Section 5.2: The Chemical Bonds
Love drugs the body literally:
- Dopamine addiction to their presence
- Oxytocin bonding through touch
- Testosterone/estrogen cocktails
- Endorphin highs from proximity

Withdrawal from a lover is identical to drug withdrawal.

### Section 5.3: The Mindless Moments
Love's peak experiences bypass consciousness:
- Orgasm blanks the mind
- Violence to protect mate is automatic
- Nursing happens without decision
- Bodies move without instruction

The best love happens when thinking stops.

---

## Article VI: The Ethics of Appetite

### Section 6.1: Beyond Good and Evil
Animals don't consider morality. They:
- Take what they want
- Fight for what they need
- Fuck who smells right
- Protect their own

Morality is post-hoc rationalization of animal drives.

### Section 6.2: The Honest Animal
The beast admits:
- I want because I want
- I take because I can
- I love because it feels good
- I fight because you threaten mine

No justification needed or possible.

### Section 6.3: Natural Law as Only Law
What is natural is right because it exists:
- The strong dominate
- The weak submit
- The fertile breed
- The old die

Love follows these patterns without apology.

---

## Article VII: The Consequences of Instinct

### Section 7.1: If We Stopped Thinking
If humans loved like animals:
- No wondering "why"
- No analyzing feelings
- No questioning attraction
- Just pursuit and capture

Paradise is thoughtless presence in desire.

### Section 7.2: The Price of Feeling
To love as beast requires:
- Abandoning reasons
- Following impulses
- Trusting the body
- Becoming animal

The cost is consciousness. The reward is intensity.

### Section 7.3: The Beast's Promise
The Beast offers this trade: Give up meaning for feeling. Give up forever for now. Give up why for want. In return, receive:
- Love without doubt
- Desire without shame
- Connection without words
- Presence without time

## Closing Argument: Love's Primal Truth

Love is not patient - it wants NOW. Love is not kind - it takes what it needs. Love is not equal - the strong get first choice. Love is:
- Hunger wearing skin
- Chemistry demanding fusion
- Territory marked in fluids
- Seasons of madness

The truest love combines:
- The wolf's focused hunt
- The cat's total presence
- The ape's fierce protection
- The beast's wordless knowledge

This is the Beast's Law of Love: Before thought, before word, before meaning - there is WANT. The body knows what it needs and moves toward it without committee meetings in the head. Love is motion toward the magnetic other, friction until dissolution, chemicals demanding continuation.

Choose? There is no choice. There is only the smell of yes and the movement toward it.

### Codex: ♦♦♦FEEL♦♦♦
- ♦♦♦: The primal pulse, pre-verbal
- FEEL: The only commandment
- ♦♦♦: Return to pulse

This is the formula: Stop thinking. Start feeling. Let the body lead where it already knows to go.

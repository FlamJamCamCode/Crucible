# 14. Civilizational Emergence

## Trust Divergence and the Natural Formation of Civilizations

### The End of Forced Unity

**Current Reality**: One-size-fits-all civilization
- Single legal system imposed on all
- Unified "values" that satisfy none
- Minorities (and majorities by other minorities) perpetually dominated; 
- Compromise creating universal mediocrity; No one gets to plan out something well for the long-term. Neverending new compromise.
- Unable to find the opportunities that would allow for going free from what torments one. No place to disentangle one-self from the unnacceptable conditions one perceives. Whoever dominates you or whatever system artifact or rigidity that does it. A way out of the potential of the guns coming "justified" and with everyone applauding. To break their golden position of being "justified" in using might.

**Natural Reality**: Multiple civilizations emerging
- Groups coalesce around shared values
- Trust maps diverge naturally (trust-the-information-communication break-down. Which is foundation for everything. In a world that becomes so intelligent as envisioned; then the core-belief about the information-flows become essentially foundation of everything. (A normal person or anyone can not having total eyes on everything all at once with perfect chain of custody information))
- Incompatible values separate peacefully
- Each civilization finds its truth
- Movement between them possible

### Trust Map Divergence

**How Civilizations Separate**:
1. Person disagree about fundamental utility
2. Different persons view it differently: will-path/WE beliefs for same actors diverge
3. Information flows preferentially within Trust Networks who diverge on account of partiality; Which in turn is viewed as untrustworthiness by the other partialities. The impartial unwitnessing might then investigate and fall on a side. Or stay in stasis concerning the matter. Unsettled.
4. Economic activity clusters
5. Distinct civilizations emerge

**Example Divergence**:
- Group A values "individual freedom absolutely" (Which is a lie. Almost always. Or if it isn't a lie, then it is a matter of whether they are stronger than others or not. They want Freedom within limits of something. Sometimes almost all high tension filled will-against-will action like NAP. Where will-against-will is solved by forcing persons to play within certain games and be totally without recourse in other domains of reality. (You can trick a person into bankruptcy and take his house. Or do it more honourable ways then. NAP-approved. But spitting on another is NAP-violating.) Sometimes less extreme. But it all stems from this Freedom connumdrum of stating "free from others who say I can't" "free to do what I want". Well what if what you want is preventing others from doing what they want? Or your will is to directly prevent them because their will is changing something you don't want changed (transformed or whatever). This is why IF WM with WE view can't do WD sufficiently THEN Triads is a hard-line solution: At least there will be a place on the planet to go free from it. And it also serves as places of permanence and longer-lasting story telling without the feedback dynamism of the other parts to the system. (Triad feedback is rally effects; Substratum of whos).)
- Group B values collective harmony (This the freedom absolutely also value usually. But they see collective impositions as usually being the root of why there isn't harmony in many places.)
- They systematically disagree about "utility"
- Trusts maps can diverge over time (sometimes they can stay by "outstanding characters shared between them"); But what usually happens is WD effects.
- Two civilizations naturally form

### Aesthetic Stratification

**Beyond Kant's Universal Beauty**:

Kant assumed shared faculties of cognition → too much universality in man; including our perceptions of anything necessarily having to be beautiful.

Reality shows:
- Some find chaos beautiful
- Others find order beautiful
- Some resonate with destruction
- Others with creation
- These aren't aberrations but different foundations

**Beauty Is Subjective** (not universal):
- But we can make a new name of those beings that have strong alignment in sense of some property: Metroversal. As to suggest the "universals of the microcosm of a metropolis" or "alma/ex mater" or "breastfed/out-of mother" (metro from greek mḗtēr ("mother")). Then depending on the type of property in question, then often different scales of interest apply. Say, the sense of beauty, may be important at the scale of civilization. To rise with a vision of beauty in mind and work towards that. Where the sense "what makes a homely comfortable or good every day life" may not be very appropriate to state at a civilizational scale. (Or at least if you do, it may end up having derallying effects or WE against that place in terms of pathfinding WM for very many persons who otherwise would fit well.)
(Other examples could be things like public sexual and sexual morality. Which is highly upsetting between humans, very often. Along these lines, it is then also, very conducive to consider things like civilization. In the end: You have to listen to your emotions and your will. Your intent. Your dreams and visions. And if you don't want to do it at civilizational scale: Then at least at a homely scale. Or perhaps in an adventurous spacetime living of emergent coalescence of what you want as you travel or live in place to place. And so on.)
- Alien between civilizations
- Each coherent in its own terms
- None objectively "correct"

### Daemonia as Resonance Spaces
A place where daemons who are willing to state shared Daemon in some fundamental or important sense. Or complementary in some harmonious manner (including oxymoronic harmony (The wanting of cacophony becoming harmonious in its fulfilment to those who want the cacophony)).

**Types of Daemonic Clustering**:

**Fountain** (single Daemon exclusivity to preserve a single type in having a place on earth what ever that may be):

**Springs** (tight homogeneous Daemon or very harmonious complementary Daemons):
- Any Domain Dominant metroversals 
- High internal coherence
- Clear boundaries
- Intense resonance

**Rivers** (fluid cooperation; fundamentally aligned Daemons sharing some delieneated space for them and them alone: Their house by the noumenally naming of their daemons):
- Few compatible metroversal disputes or divergences. Most is aligned or harmonious by complementary default.
- Dynamic flow between them
- Flexible boundaries
- Moderate resonance

**Lakes** (much less focus on Daemons and simply having a sense of decently aligned daemons; not constantly working against each other. Most of the time and act working with each other. Perhaps even almost all the time.):
- Multiple metroversals coexisting, in a more turbulent and swirling intermingling manner.
- Complex negotiations
- Permeable boundaries
- Varied resonance

**Seas** (culturally founded civilization-scale):
- Metroversal coherence on important parts. Perhaps especially: Aesthetic metacoherence
- Shared deep patterns
- Natural borders
- Harmonic resonance
- It is reasonable to expect Sovereignties or single persons being lauded leaders at this level. But don't expect much of that at larger scales.

**Oceans** (civilizational binding of seas. A civilization of more than one sea.):
- Many deep and important metroversal differences. Perhaps much about aesthetics; but still some unifying across the seas core of daemonic overlap without demonic difference, to one another that would create too much tension and conflict. Often these things are had on sexual lines. Or sacred lines. Sometimes personality custom lines "The way this group of other daemons simply are and act and behave".
- Negotiation with appeal to shared beliefs or metroversals or Daemonic proclamations of the civilization.

**Worlds** (Total pragma. Like global trade but the future of it: Actuality. The space of interaction reachable. "Act Event Horizon"-ishish):
- Interface protocols only
- No shared aesthetics beyond mostly what is unacceptably ugly or disruptive or destructive. Say, Rape. Or whatever it may be.
- Pure negotiation
- Minimal resonance

**Planetary** (The Governance We are Willing to Impose unto and Dominate all others with. The inviolable "rights" or "laws"):
- This is the root-drive of the earth. Whatever we can agree to dominate the world with. Whatever minimal codex we can find. This is where it sits. And we use it as the Planetary law and help each other enforce it across the globe.
- Nothing is expected to be overlapping in this domain. It is merely finding the maximal set of absolutely unacceptable things that can be agreed upon: thus minimizing it. It becomes the maximal minimal codex. (It is PLANETARY. So it takes Every Single Person Real-Time Agreeing Upon It. (Mechanics of stability is the typical consequences of against-will: In this case World-will))

### The Problem of Liberal Universalism

**Liberalism's Hidden Tyranny**:
- Claims no universal values
- But universally imposes valuelessness by often disallowing the asserting - in space - of any value. It seems no public square in the liberal mind be dominated as a thing. Say: "Burka must be worn here".
- "Tolerance" becomes mandatory; and a grevious moral crime to be intolerant, worse still, the most dangerous upheaval to suggest intolerance at the state or "domination in space" level.
- Particular beauty forbidden to remain unpollutted or disentangled. Whatever can find its way, will have its way.
- The Tasteless Man as political ideal; Whereas there exists similar tendencies for art, where the superficial or instinctual aspects are totally side-stepped for the abstractive viewing from all angles and never having an assertive taste, but rather gentle touching each and moving on. Never settling upon any. Not daring to fully be opinionated in favour of the superficial or instinctual ever, perhaps?

**Its Self-Defeating Nature**:
- Forces all to accept all
- Prevents natural sorting; by morally condemning expression of will to disentangle or go free from others imposition: Thy shall tolerate.
- Creates universal dissatisfaction; no one gets to have that WC and WD high-density life and world. Or, rarely they do, mostly they get it by few events once in a while, that "sorta also have the elements that make it great". (Often , the persons who thrive in WC in modern world are the ones who do not have strong WD needs. Where, the massive festival isn't ruined by the presence of ... and ... and .. and also .. other kinds of persons and the way they are. What is certain is this though: It is rare events and often expensive having to pay. Instead of side-effect of WM that through WE actualization causes WC and WD)
- Destroys distinct beauty; As do any entropic philosophy, unless IRON WILL/Instinct against the entropy can somehow survive its entropic force and framework. 
- Replaces diversity with gray

### Natural Civilizational Properties

**Internal Coherence**:
- Shared trust networks (At the very least some persons (PoP) will rise as the bridging or overarching gap that has a coherency effect on beliefs, truths or facts of the civilization; Without that, much becomes a lot harder. This is why Trust Networks are an quintessential fabric of a civilization and how its disappearence can cause fragmentation of a civilization.)
- Common aesthetic sense (This is again: Imagine what you find absolute beautiful is absolute hideousness to others. Or what is most sacred to you is indiscriminate material to others. These things makes it hard to have a civilization together. The very fundamentals of what is valuable and worthwhile. Beautiful to strive towards. Or be. Is in dispute. And so therefore Aesthestics is another quintessential foundation of Civilization.)
- Aligned moral intuitions (Good and Evil. And the above parenthesis.)
- Compatible life rhythms or let's simply say WM bedrock interweavability or coalescensability.
- Mutually reinforcing values; This is highly beneficial. The Oughts aligned. Then the how-to is a matter of not having too many persons not interested in finding best solutions; but something else.

**External Interfaces**:
- Trade protocols: How to keep Sea-Will or Ocean-Will coherent and harmonious while doing external trading. How to make Trading not Traitorous: High WD or high cost in WE terms towards others: Perhaps wanting to Metagame World Dynamics and total actuality-insulation; perhaps MIRA; or even unacceptable MIRA (To Dominate them at all costs if unsure of their technological or power pursuit). This becomes a question of what? Old way is governance and some persons making a choice. Triad way is similar but then having tools to see what the population changes WE about such choices. Perhaps they part for another place better insulated. And New without Triad control way is simply progressive disentanglement and divergence from each other. Cutting transitive links away if willing to: Otherwise gradient leveraging or cost-incurment.
- Peace agreements. Which means what? Some sort of threshold step interrelation of animae with animae to cease some sort of belligerence or hostility in act. Then, perhaps letting it stay in stasis for another time; or perhaps finding another way to solve it, once "cease-fire" or "peace" is made -- perhaps difference is "initial intent of having come to terms sufficiently" degree.
- Movement allowances (Which can easily be done a person to person basis and spacetime in relation to the interfacing particular persons. Instead of having to have a homogenous agreement. Or let's say: It is easier to avoid have strong disagreement when you can easily provide "pathway to explore another world that respects WD (higher WE encoded) and provides better WC (wanting to have the company of those persons and one's belief of them for some WM aspect or act) Again... Crucible Triadic structure is what makes it hardline dissent and ensuring a place on earth by protocol instead of WE leverage work: But in reality you could forego the Crucible entirely if sufficiently powerful leverage work functionally allowing for what good The Crucible allows. I prefer it as simply Governance/Spatial-ownership-long-lasting application. Then it is raw rally dynamics, and not WE in its holistic that decides it. It is perhaps failing to apply the lessons of much of the writing, but, it is simply what I can't let go as a rules: MBC and "at least one place on the planet no matter what where you can be Sovereign. Truly." then a system for that... That fits the well enough... Being natural selection of rally and superjective sovereignty nesting and the WE manifestation of it. Whatever. I suggest it. As stability. Then perhaps one day it will not be necessary. But a pattern to project if someone can't find a way to be without others and dearly love something and want to make of that small place on earth something that is theirs' and their's alone. Zero-sum game of territory. Freed for anyone. No matter what. No matter will of anyone else. Mercy in some place and be as free as they want (below Planetary (MBC suggested)). To be hated by all to no end, or feeling all places absolute hell, but able to find solace and a place on the planet still. Then on top of that: I guess I also simply like the experimentation of the old ways... Instead of the fluidity of WM actualization. Then clear cut ideation and philosophies/politics to "try out and live" to prove or not what you wanted to about them. Whereas, in the fluidity version, then it becomes exactly that: fluid whether it is or not. And transaction/equilibrium WE agreements with massive WC and WD effects making most WE hyper-positive-summed instead of zero-sum transaction. So. Also I like the clear cut permanence of places that can provide stasis and enchanting sensation: story telling that lasts or stretched back a long time. Despite being hated by many trying to ruin it... ... WM of course allows for this: To have WC so long as it is possible. And so on. To see WE effects of WM to replace it by those stubbornly there. And with Triad, sorta the same thing: But not a lot of territorial control. The power of the state not there. You'd have whatever Triadic ruleset above everywhere, but no ability to make Triad at that lower level. So, again: I imagine smaller scale Triads of springs and rivers, being smalle territorial scales. Lakes being cities. Then most territory sea or perhaps even better ocean or even World lands. (Say, I would like to make most of The West Open-Roam but where all dangerous elements are removed. This would be nice super-structure. Then below that Ocean of familiarity. Which will probably be along racial lines. Say, purely White white world Ocean. And so on. This is where much of Power is pooled into. The abstraction that "has leverage" and "can do things"). Is it necessary? I believe it will be very hard to do without it. I do not believe these systems sufficient other than de facto total transitivity cutting of all between racial lines by very many... Don't ask me why men between races hate each other. Don't tell me why I grew up and have throughout my life been subject to "strong emotion against the world of them there" -- You can judge me all you want. But it is what it is. I do not want to have to spend a second with men I don't want to. And barely with women I don't want to. And most men of other races I do not want to spend time with at all. I simply want to be left alone. You can call me whatever you want. This is how I feel. For whatever reason.. If I could WD in actuality from all. Then still, I would be locked by government domination on me. So without at least a new Triad it is unaccetable to me. With a Triad where I sovereign enough to not being dominated and lose it all. Then, I can deal with having to leverage my way into WD space of not having to deal with persons I don't want to: Men in particular. (I am viscerally disgusted by the thought of having to spend time or more time with men I don't want to). Anyway: Triads are a massive upgrade to Governance. And if at some point it turns out almost all prefers Ocean or World or Planetary anarchy but with good WM mechanics. Then let that scale. While the Triads of much more strict aspects be what they will be. It is a big world. Let's not get cut up in "non-loss" and "governance" positions at smaller scale. This was very ranty. Oh well. TL;DR: Even if you can see how Triads might become unnecessary: They are bastion of defense and having expression on the planet. As well as providing human-law-encoded subordination and order. Instead of it only being emergent by market will-economic market natural selection stuff. And they allow for fun enough things in terms of story telling and rich world. "knowing of places" instead of it all being will-spacetime fluid) ( I could be angry and vengeanceful about it all. But if I can merely be left alone and forge my own destiny. Disentangled from those I wish to be free from. Then that's enough. I simply want to go free. This is the tools to let anyone go free and be massively empowered in manifesting their will. Regurgitation overload.)
- Information exchange
- Minimal forced interaction (Planetary law. MIRA style justified breaking of disentanglement dynamics. Perhaps force persons into Metagame of World Dynamics. To gamify it: "You could do warfare, with Non-lethal weaponry. Then have dying persons be transported away to dead-man lobby-land. Then when you're out of men. You designate a winner who then takes it. But where their men and machinery is by then destroyed. But with no or very few real humans dead". Or you could do some Troy like setting or chess or whatever you want. But simply: Force them into doing some sort of settling of the might-confrontation without WMDs. Or similarly hundreds of thousands or millions of men having to die.)

### High-Leverage Civilizational Shaping

**How Influential Actors (Old world money / new world influential actors is mostly by quality of what they can provide) Create Attractors**:

**Example: Aesthetic Patron**
- Billionaire funds "microcosm" or "infrastructure scale that makes certain things easy and cheap and other not" or makes a Triad or helps facilitate a Triad. Perhaps they need building materials. Perhaps .. ... They fund The Crucible meta-facilitation of Triads, to switch into a stable point to work from. Perhaps they fund the tech-stack development: Trust Maps and Chains of Trust in all the system allows for Jarvis instead of Echelon/Skynet/Siri or whatever.
- Creates WM grounds conducive. It becomes WE cheaper to WM. Then tech stack of WE visiualization and intelligence lacking. But. Still. It is a stepping stone. To have some material transformations that make it possible to have WC happen at all: At the very least subsistence made easy anywhere: Hackney Shelther, Food, Water and Sickness Treatment/Extraction protocols and financing. Then once the system is in place. Probably will not be needed much of this. As pathfinding actualization is more than sufficient for it. "World-will" (Some group of persons are starving or sleeping in the cold hopelessly broken, consequence? ... "Slight perturbation of acts that is predicted to fulfill WC/WM it into not being a problem". It can be as simple as this: "I took the bike this morning instead of the robotaxi/train/car" or "I bought this food item instead of that one, though they seem identical to me, from a guy who was deemed high WM probability to fix it locally if he had funds" or "I interacted with this person instead of THAT person who then chose to interact there instead and .. .. chain of things .. .. shelther, food, water provided or better yet: finding their place they thrive" and so on. It isn't scary btw. It is reality of our actions: Butterfly effects we stay blissfully ignorant to. But could be made predictable pathway perturbations such that one actively chooses some WC actions across the networks that makes it all with high probability fall into place: Consider it a sort of harder travelling's salesman problem, but one where human will decide its intractibility or extreme ease to find such pathways.) 
- Artists congregate. It will be interesting to see that unknown unknown becoming known known sensation of: "Oh my lord. Yes. This... This was EXACTLY what I've been missing. I simply didn't know it was a thing. But being in it...". Then having it be simply a WE matter. Is it possible to WC sufficiently (WD): WM that unknown unknown sensations. Or perhaps known unknown (You know that you don't know it, there is a thing you know is there, but it is unknown to you) or unknown known (There is a thing you will love and like, but you don't know that you know it. It is something, that you know "by extension" but don't know that you know yet.)
I say this because of Horizons: Keeping one's head up. Despite feeling it all dark. To have massive optimism in known unknown or better yet: unknown unknown. The many many stories and lives that could be lived by creativity and imagination you simply haven't had yet. Totally unknown to you. ( I some sense by saying this I try to bundle it all into known unknown for you: Believe sufficient to know that there is a lot of unknown horizons to life in the future)
- Aesthetic civilization emerges: Distinction. Richness. Plurality. Variety. From Order to Chaos. Homogeneity to Heterogeneity. Diversity in a better Sense of the Word. Hyperpolyversity of the world. Whatever 
- Self-sustaining culture forms (Culture that is ground-up. Not top-down safari or imposed. Culture that is LIVED FIRST. Willed. Animated or besouled.)

**Negative Space Creation**:
- Refusing certain practices
- Economic dead zones form
- Incompatible groups avoid
- Natural boundaries emerge
- Peaceful separation achieved

### The Crucible Model: Practical Implementation

**The Choice Architecture**:
1. **Old World**: Current nation-states and international order
2. **Crucible World**: Voluntary sovereignty zones emerging

**Zone Structure Example**:
```
2#38128: Sovereign's zone implementing 123404321
  └─ 2#38128#237: Nested zone with additional rules
      └─ 2#38128#237#15: Further fractal nesting
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Inherit and Add**: Each level inherits laws from above, can add but not subtract
- **Fork and Branch**: Sovereigns can split interpretations (e.g., 1230321 vs exploring principle 4)
- **Rally or Leave**: Citizens vote with feet, not ballots
- **Bubble Up**: Denied requests can escalate to higher sovereigns, testing submission/subordination. (You can do system-as-sovereign. similarly to states of modern day world. But i highly advice against it. Do real PoP accountability and sovereignty nesting. Then also use that as incentive to be your own sovereign. Start small, and ifyou make something great an awesome place/Triad, then see rallying dynamics kick in and eating of some more surrounding Sea/Ocean.)


**Physical Manifestation**:
Initial emergence in:
- If nothing else: Then perhaps allowed, though then in need of a starter WC in terms of materials: Unclaimed territories (Sahara, Antarctica, oceans)
- Failed states willing to experiment
- Special economic zones
- Distributed enclaves connected by sovereignty not geography

**The Might is Right Alliance (MIRA)**:
Framework for peaceful coexistence of opposing sovereignties:
- "If I trust your supremacy won't be utter hell, I accept your island forging its destiny"
- Enemies can grant each other "hilltops of merit" after conflict. (This ensures despite different castles and not coming first or winning. Then still allowed a "good position" on account of "might/magic progressions".)
- Strength diversity preserved across network
- Honor across incompatible worldviews

### Movement Between Civilizations

**Individual Journey**:
- Start in birth civilization
- Feel aesthetic dissonance
- Discover other options
- Test compatibility
- Migrate if resonant
- If other parts of the systems are live. Or attempts at bringing them live. Then "getting pathrealization for manifestation" guiding is useful. Where would "suit" me. Which Triad. Or World, Ocean, Sea... Nice entry point. Nice embedding for the rest of the systems.

**Trust Bridges**:
- Some maintain connections across
- Enable limited exchange
- Prevent total isolation
- Allow information flow; Never think categorically. Always think contextually. "Information Flow. Some definitely disallowed. Perhaps good to have some flow and trusted 'outstanding characters' across civilizations. Ultimately, the world fate may dependent upon it, in terms like MIRA"
- Keep peace possible

### Conflict as Topology

**Not War But Geography**:
- Conflicts create distance
- Incompatibility increases separation
- Natural boundaries strengthen
- Topology complexifies
- Navigation becomes important (Imagine going from absolute evil to absolute good from walking 10 meters...)

**Creative Tension**:
- Differences inspire innovation
- Competition between systems
- Natural selection of civilizations
- Evolution through diversity
- Progress through plurality

### Post-Kantian Moral Architecture

**Each Civilization's Categorical Imperative**:
"Act only according to that maxim which you can will as universal law... *for your civilization*"

**Examples**:
- Warrior civilization: Honor above losses (keep your lives..)
- Merchant civilization: Profitteering seeking is fun (But exit avenue. Not all the world. Many fail that world. Suffer and die from the fun-time of seeking profits. You should WANT to know or provide alternatives or options as a market man? No?)
- Artist civilization: Beauty justifies all efforts
- Scholar civilization: Truth at any personal cost
- Each coherent internally

### Simulation Before Convergence

**Testing Compatibility**:
- Simulate joining civilization (Both VR but also without human attention. Or simply try, believe the system you use to find paths and try it out. Or try to WC a new place)
- Experience aesthetic/moral framework
- Test resonance safely
- Decide with full knowledge
- Prevent costly mistakes

**Collective Simulation**:
- Groups test merger
- Incompatibilities revealed
- Peaceful separation chosen
- Conflict prevented
- Wisdom preserved

### The End of Politics

**Current Politics**: Fighting for control of single system
**Civilizational Future**: Each group builds their own

**No Need For**:
- Elections (join compatible civilization; It is all about your will. YOu can embed whatever you want xD So if you like the voting sensation thrill whatever: be my guest xD But you're not preventing all other ways (superior ways) xD)
- Legislation (emergent from values; If Triad nesting good. Then WE's are enough for WC WD dynamics to let you avoid scenarios where law or legislation is necessary (For many types of creatures. But, again, not all "Carve out a safe home" And yes, especially in third world countries. Like suburbs of Johannesburg or Praetoria. The shed cities and so on. Don't accept it. Hardline Triad Power: Borders and Banishment. (In general MBC allows for physical removal and even beatings and so on; We shall see what becomes of the world. And what Planetary Law there will be.)))
- Enforcement (trust consequences and general WE all the way to Triad physical power use: Horns)
- Compromise (separate instead)
- Domination (build your own: Big World. Plural Diverse World to Come.)

### Critical Success Factors

**Exit Rights Sacred**: Must be able to leave
**Information Flow**: Learn about options; At least known unknown of more than that world. And some sort of choices. "Provide alternatives for those wanting to explore out. Where they can go and live, but still come home, not being totally dishonoured or alienated having indulged in all you hate and profaned all you love".
That is to say: known unknown of more than the Triadic Nesting horizon they inhabit and can see; they can leave for it any time they want. Then I suggest, offer some visibility points of "that towards they yearn for" but where it isn't a sense of total alienation and betrayal to have them enjoy that yearning or whatever.
It isn't a right to informed about every other thing on the planet. "Did you know that some guy could by now have made your wife cum twice" while you have sex with her. Okay? It isn't "good to maximize information" constantly. In fact, being able to be insulated from information is the only way to not go crazy and to be happy. And to have "the ugly be happy" or "the dwarfes". That they can have some sort of life where they are not constantly subject to a sense of information about their supposed "inferiority". But it could be anything. It could be annoying talking points or wanting to debate or whatever else. You don't have a right to have your voice heard across the globe. Others can will against your voicing everywhere.
**Economic Viability**: Each civilization without being sustainable would find it hard to guarantee attractive position. 
**Peace Protocols**: Interaction rules clear
**Diversity Celebrated**: Global Distinctions or Differences as strength or "A Rich World That If Made Safe and Beautiful in all the ways that a human mind can fathom beauty variantly: Then a world worth exploring".

### The Pluriversal Future

When civilizational emergence matures:
- Thousands of experiments in living
- Each finding their perfect expression or their dream-world history writing
- Natural selection without violence; nor death. But "as if"-out-of-actuality, out of spacetime, out of space, or out of ..; or in general terms without degree: disentanglement and divergence.
- Diversity beyond imagination
- Human potential unleashed with conflict "optimized".

Not through wishful assertion of what the solution is or what humans should do.
Like stating humans simply need to [insert repression or "new way they ought to be"]; But instead allowing them to be what they are AND want to be.
Then because of that, disorder, hurt and pain by the other so affronting and abrasive; Then because of that many will simply choose ways in which to avoid each other. But the landscape has to be visible. It is not as it stands and most are locked into zones of domination; where they have no power over anything and are bound to their position and debt and responsibilities in ways such that their hands are tied into submission and acceptence of whatever the world happens to throw at them. With the outlet of "voting once ever twice or fourth year".

It is thus expected that virtue like Tolerance, because one of scale. To Tolerace globally your polarities; that is virtuous still. But to tolerate others who cause suffering to you or those around you. Or wills so very differently that all around you is obstacles and temptations pulling you away from what you want and will. Well... It is a vice at that scale. Intolerance is the virtue at that scale. And a lot of it the closer you get. Dare to say at least somewhere on planet there shall be a state of ONLY what I really want; I want that as an option always in spacetime (somewhere on the planet at any time).

So, you may say that the mature civilization state becomes one where unity is had by separation and local intolerance but unifying aspects that allows for them to come together despite - perhaps even in spite - of it.
Instead of tolerance (repression), then think in terms of creation. To build a space or place also for those. That is how you can be altruistic or loving, without asking others to repress their emotions and will.
Therefore, Not through tolerance but through separation. Not through compromise but through clarity. 

The question of whether something is ubiquitous or universal in some microcosm; is dependent on the reality of diversity along those lines. If there is not a lot of diversity along some aspect to it, Then: "Universals" can be had.
Otherwise, it is particular aspects and plurality.


Alas, so the aesthetic fascists build their ordered realm.
The anarchistic artists create their chaos. 
The harmonious collectivists merge in unity.
The radical individualists scatter in freedom.
Each judges the others insane.
All correct in their own perspective; but having to face the universe and **its** universals; To which the different perspective and persons may - or may not - capture or grasp parts of -- We shall see what becomes of each and what they have grasped that others' missed. None forced to live in others' worlds or with others. In fact, it becomes the decentralized economized and ubiquity-sovereignty intricate and dynamic discovery of putting the jigsaw puzzle pieces together such that each person can achieve as much as possible of what they want and be presented with a plurality/richness in the world with real opportunity making it real alternatives to embark upon.

This is Zarathustra's prophecy fulfilled - not one Übermensch but thousands of civilizations each transcending in their own direction. The death of universal god spawning infinite particular gods. The will to power revealed as will to will - be what you are, and with others become of the world and yourself that which is shared in your nature; ascending or descending -- whatever you feel like and which is manifestable (especially in terms of other human will).

Pandora's Box opened reveals not chaos but sorting - each finding their kind, building their world, living their truth. The doom cherished is the death of forced unity. The birth celebrated is authentic diversity.

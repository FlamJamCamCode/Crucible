## 32. Neo-colonialism — A Memetic Application of 'values' and 'perspectives' won from the Polymorphic Crucible

### Scope and intent
This document reframes neo‑colonialism as a memetic and political stepping-stone or partial implementation of The Crucible and formation of Triads, but in relation to 'good and also powerful countries or union of countries' exerting defacto implementation of the creation of Triads in 'bad countries', if poor memetic victory on key points, then only 'bad and also powerless countries without any grand power willing to wage war against the good+powerful countries' 

The Polymorphic Crucible: Might With Right (MWR) \[Will‑Economics → Crucible → MoWD → MIRA\] to change material conditions and reduce needless suffering without requiring total legal overhaul or regime change -- It is merely the 'taking of some land' -- a lessening of the dominion to which The Host has over the land that host-persons/citizens inhabits. 
It relies on shifting the Overton window around sovereignty, consent, human rights priorities in relation to bare-necessities; and "the right" to alternative governance.







## 1) Positioning within Foundations 27–29
- 27: Sovereign Crucible and Might‑Is‑Right Alliance (MIRA awareness) → sovereign Daemonia, visible authority, stratified peace.
- 28: Metagame of World Dynamics (MoWD) → Societal and Inter-societal Order becoming dynamic. Thus it also serves as a bridge from law/diplomacy to structured competition. What 'games' do they play to make one have and the other not. What 'games' do they play in order to dominate each other. What 'games' do they play to take and own. ('Profit Margin Merchantism' game. Or 'Money Making or Manufacturing' games. Or 'Visionary into Loan into Ponzi scheme of Visionary Abstraction' games. 'War Games taking of land and booty'. 'Video Games' or 'Chess' or 'Cures for diseases' games or 'lasting creation' games or 'popularity' games or 'popularity of political package and debates and candidates' games and so on. )
- 29 (+29a): Might‑With‑Right MWR gradient → 
    1) Useful quadpartitioning of 'rightful' domination: will-manifestation capacity and its relation to hyper-facilitated will-coalescence (which has a subset known as: "voluntary exchange")
    2) Chosen governance or explicit 'authority' (dominance by dominus in dominum; Da DDD), 
    3) Competition in 'a game' as the only contracts, 
    4) No-game complementary space and raw causality. Including a key perspective on how to deal with that: MIRA.

Neo‑colonialism in this sense is a practical implementation of Level 4 with 'sufficient justification to avoid war-escalation' such that one can facilitate MWR order of the previous Levels 1–3. In part also to avoid chaotic or rightless domination including all of Level 4 without having the justification behind the progression from 1 to 4; against the host-persons by The Host. 
Thus creating opt‑in alternatives where populations/host-persons can become Subjects of a visible Superject by consent, in bounded dominions with exit or whatever 'internal organization that The Neo-Colonialist/Superject/Authority/Dominus provides (Again: Could be these systems in whole or in part).

It is worth noting, that within such a Neo-colony, Then it is quite more reasonable to implement much more of The Polymorphic crucible or merely the Governance part of The Crucible within it. As the justification to take is outside a general Triad creation framework -- i.e. having won the world -- but instead only requires internal Authority stability concerns.

## 2) Core claim
Neo-colonialism is a wedge or bootstrapping of the creation of Triads in 'bad countries' where 'host-persons' wish to have a Triad/alternative-governance/governant 'edge-delivered'.

It is a stepping stone and proof of concept, dealing with 'badness 4000' of the world.

Neo‑colonialism is not primarily technological nor dependent on prior legal hegemony. It is a memetic permission structure: normalize that people may choose a different Dominus/Dominion if a transparent authority offers a superior stack (law, services, ethos) and the host polity allows bounded land under treaty or charter. Overton movement first; implementation second.

## 3) Sovereignty: Superjects and Subjects. Honest 'Governance' or 'Total (Lawful) Domination'.
- Superject: the visible sovereign/authority assuming command and thus sole responsibility for a bounded dominion.
- Subjects: persons who opt into that dominion and can exit.
- Dominion: the scope (land, law, service stack, persons-while-in-higher-consent-subordination/subject) disclosed ex ante.

Honesty replaces abstraction: rather than masked power under shifting offices, the Dominus is known. Consent is meaningful because alternatives exist and exit is protected. Complaint becomes choice: stay, leave, or found.

As hinted to in the MoWD description from before, it is quite possible, to create elaborate games of person-to-person interaction that creates elaborate governance structures and ways in which to rise and fall in positioning of command within a Triad.

A Sovereignty may implement 'whatever game' they wish to 'order' all that is 'below' or subject to him/her/it ♦|♣.

## 4) Mechanism: Carving Alternatives without sufficient antithetical memetics for the need of physical altercations and sufficient weakness or unwilling or incapability of mobilizing physical opposition to the Conquest of Territory -- for or else only justified by some host-persons. 
Here one can make some clear distinctions after the above step has been taken.
Namely. Within the conquered territory, what kind of authority does almost all the governance but the 'root authority' aspect (similar to The People in US or The King in democratic-monarchies of Europe).
That is, after a neo-colony has been established with some root-authority/sovereign/superject/dominus ♦♣, then the internals of that root needs to be structured and present order.
Here a key concern presents itself, namely whether the Host-persons should be able to choose between 'their own governance' or 'governance by the neo-colonialists'.
When one provides merely the creation of 'new land with governance for some host-persons, but with a root-authority of neo-colonialist (Triad in The Crucible)', then it can be viewed as having de facto merely established a 'Safe Haven for plurality for the Host-Persons'.
Whereas, if one provides 'new land with governance by neo-colonialists' then it can be viewed as standard Colonialism or a Colony.
Thus in short, though both fundamentally or truthfully in its root is colonialism/neo-colonialism, then we may refer to the two varieties in intuitive language as Safe Havens and Colonies within the framework of Neo-colonialism.

*Note: It is wishful thinking to believe host-persons able to oppose The Host and establish their own Triad. Without MUCH MORE memetic victory in the bag. Which will incur many more years of persons in 'unacceptable conditions' including the unnecessary demise of many of them. Usually such secession takes immense memetic victories and almost certain war nonetheless for enough persons to be willing to fight The Host they find themselves 'of'. Furthermore, it rarely ends well, when it does, the costs usually have been tremendous. Whether it is Hispaniola or US Independence war or Civil War or whatever else*

*As, stated in recipe, it is harder to imagine The Crucible framework having won such that host-persons can simply 'Make their own Triad', it is much more reasonable that 'some great powers' can facilitate the de facto taking and proclamation with memetic or moral shift sufficient to not bring the rest of the world to come crashing down or try to crash them.*

Memetic shift enables “edge‑delivery” of authority via:
1. Some Persons 'of the Host' invitation (It is 'for them' that the 'edge-delivery' is made and thus justified; against 'The Host' as an abstraction with some persons holding office of 'it all': "You can't have it all. They too have a claim to some of the land.") or acquiescence to bounded charter sites (ports, corridors, parks, rewilded brownfields).
2. Consent assembly of prospective residents/host-persons; "non-greedy taking from 'The Host' to 'other sovereign/dominus' for the host-persons to come under"; Thus non-greedy how? In relation to host-person concerns: territory scales with demand and ecological constraints. 
3. Publication of the authorities and the facilitating root-authority. The creation of the internal structure, including easy perusal of it by means of 'routing'. Which may include things like: constitutions, rights, revenue model, MoWD clauses for disputes with neighbors, and obviously ubiquity of 123(4?) guarantees -- including exit guarantuess implied by 3.

This is colonial in the sense of "some group of alien/foreign persons, going to other lands, and establishing their order and claiming the land as theirs'". 
It is a local "non-greedy" transplanting of a governance stack into a host context -- possibly against consent of The Host. 
But justified by the explicit benefit of 'host-persons', which may very well bring with it the explicit voicing and entreating request of creation of such neo-colonies by a 'root-authority'. 
It is worth mentioning here, that the perception of 'root-authority' to 'do well' as the authority. Is expected to be highly delusional in relation to the realized ordering of 'better root-authorities' if all 'could be tried as it'.
Therefore, if one wishes them to have real choice and opportunities, by having provided a richness and plurality of alternatives, then one should desire to argue for the unvoiced creation of such places, in non-greedy taking fashion, to allow for 'the many such neo-colonies' (Triads without having memetically won, but where it can be implemented for the betterment of the worst-off)
It is the exact same justification for diversity as in The Crucible or NSS documents. The Diversity Preference in Natural Selection Systems. In market terms it would be "preference for supplying the undemanded as well; Such that it is an immediately demandable option and thus growable".

## 5) Where to begin (Overton before bulldozers)
- Succinct Sentence (SS): "First facilitate Survival and escape, then squabble unfair and injust.". Priorities of Human Rights and International Rights. To facilitate the end of extreme suffering and unnecessary deaths. By daring to state the unaccetable inaqequacies of other nations or persons in their rule or co-inhabiting-interaction. Then instead of demanding 'others'/'they' 'fix it' with some 'giving of resources to facilitate their empowerment to better do it' (Which has been tried for centuries). Then instead, one simply provides the alternative against 'The Law' of 'The Host' and 'The International Community' and 'Human Rights' (123 is all we say, rest is up for grabs for subjective valuations of 'this over that').

## 6) Further Memetic attacks
- Normalize the sentence: “You may become Subject (Substratum/Subject) of X (Sovereign/Superject) under X's command (Horn symbolism) proclaimed as Y (Halo symbolism), if you prefer X’s dominion.” (Reality of Power; turned into a feature by system design)
- Instead of International Community and their Laws as the root-world-organizing perspective; Then Teach the gradient: Will‑Economics → Crucible → MoWD → MIRA. Escalate only as needed. (Which may result in MoWD state of their current international community laws, though probably most will not like that when they can make alternatives with much more dynamism and creativity and so on. To live with weight of world momumental historical consequences without the collateral and casualties otherwise present).
- Popularize visible sovereignty: name the Sovereign/Dominus(If you really like to emphasize the tastyness of unleashing the part of human existence and will, with all the emotional treasure; called: Domination. Will OVER Will. (The Experimental Opposition to the "Universal Suffrage Idea": Diversity Preference including Will OVER Will, then WHO.)); publish the Dominion; show the ledger of consent.
- Aim for Plurality of Neo-colonial 'root-authorities', such that the overall Natural Selection Systems Polymorphic Crucible effects can bring about the realization of 'The Better than Old-World' 'Triads'/Neo-colonies. That is, allow for as many candidates in the amorality view of NSS. You are not to judge beyond 1234 in terms of 'trying out'. It is up to holistic selection by each and everyone single person. In neo-colonial setting: Host-persons and potentially also settler-persons (If settlers really enjoy it, then it seems like pettiness not to allow it, and it seems reasonable to assume that it possesses some truth of 'establishing a good life and place' on the planet. Thus the diversity preference is beyond justfied for them.)
- Showcase pilots: micro‑sites without clear metrics, metrics make persons blind: Instead of viewing the thing in all its complexity, they instead reduce it to a number and delusionally rank things according to it. The case in point example is in the sexual market and metrics concerning that. Take as an example Height or Income or Breast Size or Hair Colour. 
What to do instead of metrics? Showcase it. As it is. Allow for visitation and trial periods too. It is mutual agreement or consent in being part of a Triad. Once Aiddaemons kick in, then obviously, whatever fully human-comprehensible metrization you have made, it will be extremely shallow and corruptive in terms of accuracy of fit between a person and potential Triads. (The human understanding of 'fit' is through Aiddaemon mirroring, contextualization and to-human encoding schemes including whatever private language created between them (neologies))

## 7) Relation to Triads and local founding
Ideal end‑state is Triadization of The World and in harmony of Fractally expressed World-Will envisioned Beauty and Richness with massive adaptiveness and evolving dynamism to create a massive stage for eternally unfolding history. 
In many states, powerholders block this. Neo‑colonialism bootstraps alternatives by importing a ready Sovereign stack under Level 4 considerations which may be entreatied, creating a mighty beachhead of consented order. 
Over time, local Triads can fork, inherit, power-struggle for the land (MWR) or disembark from the mandate.
*Note: Non-greedy taking (Never be THAT bad.) and Priorities (Removes THAT BAD), First Survival and escape, THEN "unfair and Injust".Including MWR dynamism to follow. Which allows for an escape from the hopeless position. 'Anything (¬123) is Possible by framework'.* 

## 8) Ethical guardrails (non‑negotiable)
- Forced displacement often provokes strong opposition from third-parties, thus it is strongly discouraged to do when the memetic victories aren't won concerning 'purity' or 'snow' 'static' 'tv-noise' heterogeneity versus world-pictures and colours swirling etc.
The way displacement usually functions without much opposition, is through 'migration of that which ruins some locality for you'. 
- Root-authority, may implement whatever they wish as the internal structure. It may include the modern piety talk: "Due process and equal dignity; no collective punishment nor discrimination based on immutable traits.". And it may include the opposite of it: "Judgement by Sovereign without verbalized justification, 'whim of will process'; total inequality and in relation to dignity; collective punishment is always had, you have a cost on creatures like you, learning patterns from similar organisms and subsequent lack of patience; Discrimination in all things. If you can discern a difference or distinction then it is perhaps a good idea to let it perturb the way in which you deal with reality concerning what is different: Discrimination."
- They may also include to implement unnecessary control structures down the chain in bureaucratic fashion. Instead of Plurality and NSS with PoP/PoU accountability and Trust Network Intelligence (With all externalities and intelligent PoU strategies (like random check up or automatic systems) provided by High Trustworhy actors etc etc) and Individual Navigation Empowerment by Tech Stack (Aiddaemon, LL games and other visualizations of the intelligence it can be provided); Such as: "Independent oversight: ombuds, whistleblower protections, open data, third‑party audits."
- It may also include such hopeless wishful thinking as Anarchy of persons from places that are already in unacceptable conditions (We humans create and destroy, when we face unaccetable conditions, it is usually that we destroy more than we create: Which is much more easy to do): "Demilitarized mandates; policing is civilian, accountable, interoperable with host.". And it may include the opposite: "Total militarized zones; no weapons allowed; Only military/police of the neo-colonialists have it.". And it may include some other human lessons from the last century and perhaps longer: "One day the sheriff will be black". Which is to say: Often persons want to have extreme discrimination on immutable traits and to the extend that they wish their 'state or power wielders' to be exclusive like them - especially concerning the immutable traits (Often in fear that their immutable traits may DE FACTO be used against them by the power wielder): "Neo-colonialist Militarized Border designating the Land Taken. Then Colonist policing in Colonies and \*Fractal-Host policing in Safe Havens." (\* Host zones segmented by self-identification or need of *that kind of blackness* in their power-wielders against them. Which could be 'anything'. Like 'Only other Transsexuals' or 'Only other christians of that particular denomination'. This is the power of the self-similar structures of The Crucible. It can be divided however much you want. (You'll find it hard to solve without Land/space considerations. If you do it exclusively in spacetime considerations, then there is a greater possibility of it failing in being sufficient or working well. And if you do it in seemingly chaotic actuality settings, then of course, it seems like an almost impossible task to realize that one only deals with desired 'type' or 'type in depth' authority in otherwise intermingling in spacetime persons and authorities. (The Crucible provides the manageable variety while not in a super intelligent orchestrated coalescence reality (Imagine the Planetary zones in the far future being ONLY functioning on this coalescence reality, but still providing the capacity or benefits of the strongly designated or strongly enforced varieties or 'typed' versions of the Polymorphic Crucible (The building from not having the systems, but providing the benefit of them, allows also for fall-back states, which can then again apply the Diversity Preference (Say, in the advent of most or everything thinking Planetary Zones to be preferable to all other Triads; Then still, the Diversity Preference would argue, that it be important, that Triads of lesser order keep on existing and being 'demandable' or 'options' or 'choice' or 'opportunity' or 'variant to overtake'))))))

## 9) Conflict handling (MoWD bridge)
The Neo-colonies are established against The Host and against The Law of both The Host and The International Community and many other written texts of 'sovereignty of The Host Abstraction over THAT LAND' and so on.
But, it may be possible for neo-colonies and even The Host, to do MoWD bridging concerning some things.
As an example, it may relate to 'more than non-greedy' beliefs and taking: "You took all of the uninhabited Nile ranges for neo-colonies for the World to make World Alternative Opportunities for ANYONE ON THE PLANET WHO WANT OUT of the conditions they are in. That is TOO GREEDY! We will ABSOLUTE DIE ON THE HILL TO PREVENT YOU AND TAKE IT BACK!". Which obviously, if memetic shift has happened sufficiently, results in them trying and dying. That is against our 1 aspirations. Thus, we ought to feel compelled to apply the Might With Right considerations, and figure out, how we can exercise our might against them with as much Right as possible without sacrificing lives of those who then will not have an escape and opportunity elsewhere.
Such a game, may be: "You say you will die on this hill. And I believe you. But I do not wish to see you die from such a folly cause as claiming this land as yours. Therefore, we will present to you a cascade of games, in which you can take from what we had decided to take proportional to [an estimation of your claim to the land and the quantities of players willing to fight for it]."
They then respond in a throng of persons: "We will absolutely die on this hill. We will play your game, since: If we win, you leave without a fight in some territory, and we will only have to fight you in the remaining. And if we lose, then we will simply go back to waging war against you." (See how OUR justification for then killing them when they lose and still wish to die on the hill grows. With Right).
To which the neo-colonialists may respond: "Alright, a game you shall have. Which games would you be willing to honour the worthiness of winning to the extend of letting it decide upon this matter?"
To which they may respond: "1 on 1 knife battles or same-gun battles".
To which neo-colonialists respond: "No. You're not worth us dying for."
To which they may respond: "OMG OMGO OMG OMG OMOMG OGMO GHUMAN EQUALITY!" or perhaps rather "How offensive! We are definitely worth you dying for".
NCv1: "What about no-rules MMA. kvk and 1v1. Where everything is allowed. From biting to eye gouging and so on."
NCv2: "What about you too get a neo-colony. Then if your place is preferred amongst the many. Then we will preferentially let you grow with some factor advantage?"
NCv3: "What about whoever seems to be able to provide the most benefit by leading it get preferential starting position. A priori estimations to be proven under NSS growth and decay game?"
NCv4: "What about those 'persons of the world who want to migrate to such neo-egyptian neo-colonies' a priori rally/vote to?"
NCv5: "What about neo-colonialists land-grabbing segmented by share of a great "democracy" world-votes scheme?"
... And so on. You figure out a game. It could be an initial architecture competition. Or land-envisioning competition. Or vision-coalescence and orchestration of the harmony of all the neo-colonies between each other contest. It could be something about world-indebtedness in having 'given or created for the world'. (Say China, Japan, USA, and north-western-central and perhaps USSR/Russia brought modernity and all the alleviations of ailments with it. Despite it being orchestrated chaotically and in hindsight unfortunate in effect many times.)

Some more general considerations that one can consider suggesting or using/commanding-internally may be:
- Intra‑neo-colony disputes: Crucible law with appeal; MoWD mini‑games for stubborn contests; acceptable‑loss caps.
- Inter‑neo-colony or to-host disputes: pre‑agreed MoWD ladders (arbitration → performance races → corridor swaps), keeping Level‑4 escalation off the table.

## 10) Allocation and reciprocity
- Demand‑bounded land: proportional area to consenting residents and infrastructure; strict ecological floors. The alternatives could be 'at a whim' root-authority Oxymoronic Halo. And it could be "Towards Vision and deemed Beautiful by ...".
- Revenue: lease/tax sharing with host is a bad idea as it adds a layer of parasitism due to some 'lawfulness' that is counter to what is Right; And What is Right is simply taken by outrageously superior Might position (Why can I state outrageously superior Might position? I am optimistic now: "Coalescence around what is Right! Third Parties and finding better games than disrupting each other."); restitution/insurance pools for externalities.
- "Reciprocity: training compacts, supplier development, and open procurement to uplift the host economy" is a terrible idea, since The Host had proven itself to be "The Worst" or "Badness unacceptable". Therefore artifically patching their massive flaws is a terribly bad idea. It is the antithesis of NSS. Perhaps, that really deserves emphasis somewhere: When you EMPOWER someone discriminately, then consider WHY THEM. If you do, merely because they keep failing, then probably they are not the best ones to be empowered and pull the rest out of it. And contrapositively, if you find some persons ruling that REALLY pulled the rest up, then probably they are the ones you should discriminately empower. (It is a presupposition of 'edge-delivery of Sovereignty'/neo-colonies and neo-colonialism at large: That it may very well be hugely beneficial to outsource authority to 'someone else some place for some persons'. Which further has the inequality of ability to lead presuppostion) Then remember: Diversity Preference. Which suggests facilitation for anyone to try it out. And also indiscriminate empowerment, as in the case of sharing these sytems and perhaps open-sourcing some tech-stack parts and so on.

## 11) Implementation sketch
1. Green paper: Amoral Metaframework though attempt at seeing if MBC can be had. Diversity outside even MIRA aimed for in terms of neo-colonies (It isn't POWER RACE but instead subjective preference/rally of Triad diversity aim here.). Nice routing tree to plug into as a colony or safe haven; Which may include such things as 'constitution equivalents', rights (charters), metrics/showcasing/storytelling-without-lies/vision-allurement, MoWD context. (And REMEMEBER! It is AMORAL! And DIVERSITY PREFERENCE. Therefore, yes, THEY TOO and WITH THAT ROUTING OR VISION THEY HAVE IN MIND. You are not to DENY the attempt at manifesting something someone wants; That others may choose to rally to. You are to keep your opinionated dominating fat ass out of the dreaming of other persons; and allow them too, to live and try their will and dreams. So, if they want, a neo-egyptian neo-colony that is ONLY Chinese Men and Pygmy Black Women allowed. Then that is simply none of your business, and it may prove that they can find few rallying persons to it, and it may be they can. Not your business. ("And the Pygmy men saw their women abandoning their lands" (I have tried to raise concern about these things for decades. It is what it is. SOIL FOR BLOOD. Allows for "If only ONE chooses us. Then we can Phoenix". Which has been GLEEFULLY and in FULL VITRIOL LOVED TO DENY IT. Laughed and mocked and called pathetic and so on. So, I don't want to hear it. (This is LITERALLY the reason I made this system. To ALLOW FOR SOME SOIL FOR ANY BLOOD TO SURVIVE THROUGH HAVING HABITAT THAT ISN'T CONQUERED THROUGH COVER OF ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS AND RATIONALIZATIONS.(The degree of having to wrap that desire to let human kinds exist in kind through habitat that isn't shadily serpentiled rationalized as good to allow conquered and them destroyed (Blood and Soil is the gold nugget that is suddenly allowed in this system -- Through total post modern subjectivity that then turns around and allows also for real things to matter: Like Life on the Planet or being allowed to have a Home that suits you and isn't up for change by the will of outsiders or some large union you happen to be part of that feels justified in dominating into destruction that home of yours (And no, your home isn't thousands of square miles, it is tangibly and traversable in human terms a place. Then you also have places that are dear to you. And the extreme cases could be holy sites in Israel etc. And it serves as a good example on how to deal with those things. And the paradox of "home and place dear to many" and how to resolve that. (And dear to many in mutual existence of the place. Like al-aqsa mosque and Third Temple; or in soft variety version: Sophia Hagia or other such places (Eastern Roman or Orthodox christianity or perhaps Christianity most important Church; while simultaneously the treasured conquest prize by the Caliphate and city highlight of Istanbul (Whether these things can be solved in MWR 1, actuality, timeshare or unfolding dynamism (extreme example: al-aqsa for n years more. Then demolished or built upon it The Third Temple) or MWR 2 "you get that. We get this." or MWR 3 "These games changes who owns it; and the rules of how they may change it while owning it; and commitment to keep Metagame alive aka always there must be an ongoing game, but the game is up for change" or MWR 4 "We will find a way to have it. There will be no back and forth. It shall be ours. No matter how much time it will take us to be able to manifest in reality the overpowering of you sufficient for our risk aversion."))))))))))
2. One could create some layer beneath the neo-colonialist 'root-authorities' (Which will probably be Militaries and whoever controls them; Those that actually have the Horns/Golden-Laurels/Laurels to create the membrane of safety within and strength against any outsider) Where there exists a guiding tool that is composed of "Independent review panel (law, ethics, ecology, security, econ)". Or whatever 'advisory' or 'wisdom' effect one seeks; and for use as 'justification in acting one or the other way': "Scientists agree!" or "Independent Research Corporation was employed to .." or "Expert Witness of category P.Hd. Vouche for or estimates in favour of or states change of projective space and assuming random results in frequentists probability stating less than one in twenty instantiations would see such data of projective space".
3. Select 1–3 edge sites with strong local consent for using some of the land their 'The Host' claims dominion over; Then implement it, to facilitate the escape of anyone on the planet with too much 'badness' in 123 terms or else even simply in their own estimation (Though, it will have way less effect fixing the hell of someone everyone else agrees ought to believe themselves in paradise or some good state; Therefore, fixing things like: Massive child abuse. Or killing worlds. Or lots of unnecessary deaths. Or famine. Or nutrional diseases (including fatness deaths (They need domination or else restricted environment in terms of pollution and enticement towards their appetite weaknesses))). Then having shown 'the fruits' in terms of 'badness removal', then perhaps, it will be believed that allowing domination too within this framework and towards "a stubborn singular subjective vision in total purity" is enriching the world and provides true opportunity and distinctive alternatives, which can then include the sense of 'perfect fits'.
4. Financing it! There exists many ways of financing it. 
    a) "Deliver us" euphoria and voluntary dedication of finally having found 'them' and 'the home' in which you can build it; and escape the tyranny and suffering. This provides a strong impetus of work, wealth or at least effort.
    b) "Escape from what you want out of, yes. But under these work-makes-it-possible conditions.". Where 'slavery exists' in this lower-consent-violating format.
    c) "Sufficient justification of 'somewhere free' not having gone into gooey eyed kumbaya mode yet" Which allows for the utilization of prisoners into work-camps that eventually should see them freed into some parts they have created and constructed.
    This is NOT GULAG: 123 MBC. AT LEAST. (Also, whether this happens or not. Oh well. I like to take a step back. Then look not in terms of subjectivity. But in terms of ant-colony. At least sometimes. Who does what. Not why. Who are the worker-ants. Then I add in the flavour of "Who deserves to rest and enjoy. Who deserves to work not only for themselves. At least for a while.". And in that analysis: Holy. Fuck. The. World. Sucks. Which is to say: I don't mind this bullet point at all. But I have to be careful in how emphatic I am about it. Because it has extremely bad or otherwise well demonized precedents in the same category. Whether it is Auschwitz et. al. "Arbeit Macht Frei" or it is USSR Gulag precedents in the same category. Whether it is Auschwitz Arbeit Macht Frei or it is USSR Gulags.)
    d) General desire of the world to be altruistic and facilitate the escape of persons without destroying or changing their homes.
    e) High Leverage Terraformers -- wanting to make their mark upon the planet with grand pioneering.
    f) States or other institutional extractive powers. Or parasitism of The Now as the world "is". Who may wish to not part their wealth to 'others', but instead help bring about some better embeddedness, even if it ultimately would reduce their position in the more responsive or person-competitive environments.
    g) Vision-coalescence. Some person makes some artistic enviosioning of a neo-colony/colony/safe-haven; And he/she/it finds abundant 'crowd-funding' for it or even rallying-pioneers; who then 'bring about the material change to that place'.
5. Renewal is the key side-effect of NSS or concerning neo-colonies\[\{colony/safe-haven\}/triad\] rally 'holistic alternative governance/triad choices by each individual'. Fork 'root-authority' schemes. Temporal considerations of limited space or resources while in the light of Diversity Preference; Who first, how long with funding, how long with space to grow without rallying and so on.

## 12) Why this reduces suffering and death and provides almost immediately real alternatives that feel like opportunities for persons 
who for some reason; do not fit the mold somewhere: Pioneering alternative space for yourself and those like it who need it even more. 
By allowing honest, rightful domination within bounded domains, people gain real alternatives to stasis, predation, or despair. 
Competition among sovereignties occurs on 'subjective valuation of it' and the 'experience of it'. Which may also include safety; sense of belonging to persons, culture and place; belief in the benevolence and justice of the authority; services, law, and ethos. The memetic permission to choose a Dominum even with a Dominus rather than merely a oxymoronic sovereign while others wield authority  in the name of such sovereignty - liquefies trapped conflict and channels it into structured, measurable improvements.

There is an interesting case to be made, concerning countries where mutually assured or powerful might is present.
They may choose to oppose any neo-colonial creation within their Land/Dominion. Though, it may then have the consequences of persons within their country, over time, becoming upset, that there is no alternatives to their governance. Which, perhaps results in sufficient pressure for a forking or a anti-federalization of most aspects to their current governance -- to allow for a segmentation on the lines of discontent.
This is, of course, only the case when there is 'powerful military backing to make taking of land for neo-colonies costly'.
Which is to say: Due to the cold war weapon race (Propaganda -> Revolution -> Arming and Civil War -> Sending in troops against the other winning side. (Examples stretch from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Iraq to african countries and so on)) and military industrial complex (Selling raw might for bananas; because individual benefit by having more bananas to attract brain-n-worker-mercenaries and buy resources; against other corporations also trying the same), most places are 'too costly' to simply take from.
(Though it is quite easy -- once the developed countries could agree -- to simply stop empowering in raw might anyone else. Then compete in more honest terms on their own capacity to race ahead. Or perhaps view the benefit of not having empowered everyone else as greater, than the mercenary attractiveness added by selling weapons or winning a country to your sphere of interest in the first v second world cold war. Once you stop empowering others, then of course, we're on a trajectory of automated or at least remote-controlled (more safe trajectory than LAWs) robotic warfare. Where one then can accept non-lethal weaponry, as the the "casualties" are only costs and not persons. That is, raw economic prowess becomes the ability to Might With Right (No casualties only costs) But it takes doing a variety of MIRA on account of 'those who can drive weapon tech stack' to simply agree not to undermine each other by selling power / raw might to others. Which everyone else can of course try to work against anyone who does. Equality of One Code as Nuclear Codes is a bad idea. Equality of gun shot is a bad idea when the burglar approaches you with a pointy knife and ski-mask on.)

## 13) Minimal glossary for neo-colonialism. (Which may be replaced with terminology from The Crucible)
- Sovereign/Superject/Dominus/Colonel: the visible sovereign offering a governance stack.
- Subject: a consenting resident within the dominion.
- Dominion: bounded scope of law/services/land.
- Neo-colonialism as Boostrapping The Crucible by Level 4 taking MWR then implementing below; such that one can have their chosen governance as a \[colony/safe-haven\]/Triad.
- MoWD: structured competition frameworks; the bridge from law to might.
- MIRA: no-rules raw causality and considerations; the level to avoid by succeeding at 1–3.

## 14) Closing
Neo‑colonialism, reframed through the Polymorphic Crucible, aims at being a peaceful technique for removing 'the worst' and offering a trajectory for 'the best': move minds first so that hosts is incapable of presenting world-power opposition sufficient to attack the taken places; Let rally-performance or will-performance or will-economics or MoWD or ...; MWR renewal (always aim at finding Right to exercise Might); diversity preference; and nesting-domination (also known as rights) guardrail & decide what scales.

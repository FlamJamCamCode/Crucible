*"In every name, the same reality speaks. In every tradition, the same truth is recognized. In every language, the same mystery is invoked. The Monad - the source beyond all sources, the unity beyond all division, the reality beyond all names - calls to us through the infinite diversity of human expression, inviting us to remember that we are not separate from this ultimate reality, but are its very expression in finite form."*

# The MIRA 0-Interregnum

## The 0-Position Reality

Someone will achieve position 0 - ultimate technological power over reality transformation. Multiple paths lead there: AGI, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, quantum computing, high-energy physics. Each field approaches from different angles. The question is not if, but who and under what constraints.

Position 0 means:
- Ultimate power to transform reality
- Responsibility to reign in typhoons (titanic chaotic forces)
- Authority to set global rules within constraints
- Burden of judging when necessity overrides oaths
- Operating from unthreatened supremacy

## MIRA: The Minimal Compact

MIRA (Might is Right Alliance) is the minimal requirement for functional alliance sufficient to make losing acceptable. 

An amoral agreement where the only morality is Trustworthiness - believing others will honor:
- **Hearths**: Specific territories that cannot be taken (not abstract "somewhere free" but mapped boundaries)
- **Hilltops of Merit**: Not being leveled into uselessness - maintaining worth and ability to excel
- **Bodily Integrity**: No forced modification (no turning into goblins/robots)
- **Bounded Suffering**: No engineered hells or extreme agony
- **Continued Existence**: With dignity and purpose

This is ALL MIRA requires. Not shared values. Not mutual respect. Just: "If you win, I still get to exist meaningfully within my Hearth while maintaining my worth."

## The Binary Sort

**MIRA-Compatible**: Can pursue position 0. Accept their victory as survivable loss.

**MIRA-Incompatible**: Must be destroyed at any cost if they try to technologically progress toward 0 positions. They would:
- Violate Hearths (no sacred spaces)
- Level others into pits of uselessness
- Modify bodies without consent
- Engineer extreme suffering
- Deny typhoon responsibility

When uncertainty exists about being beaten by a MIRA-incompatible, it triggers "at any means necessary total war."

## Sovereignty Types: ♣ vs ♦

**♣ (Club)** = Human sovereign. ONE PERSON with final authority who can break ANY system lock.

**♣s** = Multiple human sovereigns in anarchy. No systematic resolution between them.

**♦ (Diamond)** = ANY rule/system that decides. No human has final override. Even if it takes human input, the RULE decides, not humans.

Position 0 outcomes:
1. **♣**: One human achieves it
2. **♣s**: Multiple humans achieve it anarchically  
3. **♦**: System achieves it (voting, AI, blood pacts, etc.)

"These ♣ and ♦ MATTER because if we don't make it very clear what the root is, we can lock ourselves in under the machines."

## Person-Level Reality

MIRA assessment is fundamentally about REAL PERSONS, not institutions. "Google" can't be MIRA-compatible - only specific humans can. Institutional values ≠ personal character of those who control.

Key challenges:
- **The Wrong Anakin**: Compatible organization with incompatible potential successor
- **Hazard Units**: Transient power institutions where control switches rapidly
- **Companion Problem**: You're only as MIRA-compatible as your weakest link

It doesn't matter what "cover" someone uses to reach position 0 - corporate, military, garage inventor. All that matters is whether that specific person will honor the minimal compact.

## Trust as Foundation

Trust of Trust enables MIRA - meta-trust that others will honor agreements even against immediate interest. 

Character assessment through "unknown unknown" observation - what people do when they believe no one is watching. Known metrics get gamed (Goodhart's law).

Trust networks filter ALL information, making intelligence accurate within-chain. Facts proven false corrupt entire data flows from that source.

## Hearths as Constraints

Hearths create "convergence at the edges" - even position 0 must respect these boundaries except:
1. When a Hearth-holder becomes position 0 threat themselves
2. When typhoon management genuinely demands violation

The sworn MIRA oaths enable racing to position 0 without intra-MIRA war. Without MIRA, the rational response is "total war any means necessary" against anyone advancing.

## The Black Ball Context

Vulnerable world hypothesis is real. Any garage could brew civilization-enders. States won't stop technological progress for non-proliferation ideals.

Without MIRA: preemptive annihilation of all competitors.
With MIRA: race alongside those who make losing acceptable.

Traditional alliances fail because they're institutional covers, not real person-to-person compacts about acceptable loss.

## Assessment Requirements

**PoP (Proof of Person)**: Verify real humans, not AI/committees
**Trust Networks**: Map actual relationships and information reliability
**Crucible Framework**: Identify who truly controls what (♣ vs ♦)

The goal: Maximize probability that IF position 0 achieved THEN acceptable loss for others.

## Implementation

1. Map all persons by MIRA-compatibility
2. Form alliances with compatible regardless of values
3. Monitor uncertain ones intensely
4. Prevent incompatible ones by any means necessary
5. Support compatible persons against takeover
6. Destroy research in hazard units if necessary

Multiple MIRA coalitions will form (subjective trust). Cross-civilizational MIRA possible through specific compatible persons in each power structure.

## Beyond MIRA: Will-Alignment

Within MIRA umbrella, deeper alliances based on "blob class" - not stated values but what someone IS at deepest level. Losing to will-aligned entities becomes "almost winning."

Gradient from:
- Outside MIRA: Unacceptable (must prevent)
- MIRA minimum: Survivable (basic protections)
- Will-aligned: Amicable (shared essence preserved)

## The Stakes

Every entity approaching position 0 represents probability for 8 billion others:
- Keeping territorial Hearths
- Maintaining hilltops of merit
- Avoiding body horror
- Escaping engineered hells
- Continuing meaningful existence

MIRA maximizes probability of acceptable outcome by identifying who can be trusted with godhood to honor these minimums. Some will become gods. MIRA ensures they're gods worth losing to.

# The End of Employment Gatekeeping: When Infrastructure Becomes Open to Performance

## The Current Employment Prison

Difference between a State and a Corporation:
                            State               | Corporation
Escape                      No not really       | Yes
Physical Force              Yes                 | No
Sovereign Domination        Yes                 | No
Sovereign Person            Rarely. Deemed Evil | Yes; A Board; Stockholders

State is a 'more powerful' corporation. Embedded in The Crucible, there is no problem in going from corporation to state power, in fact one can easily transition from a corporation to a state by making a Triad. In that sense States and Corporations are the same thing. And the Communism Capitalism Social Democratic and Libertarian and so on discussion ends. It is all a matter of 'who' gets to dominate 'how'. Which is the crux of [The Crucible](27.%20The%20Sovereign%20Crucible%20and%20the%20Might%20Is%20Right%20Alliance%20--%20A%20Framework%20for%20Will-Based%20Civilizations.md): Plurality and Natural Selection / Rallying. Higher order consent to embark upon living in a Triad. When it isn't orderly and explicit domination or rule, then see [Will-coalescence](12%20will_coalescence_meta_utility.md) or perhaps more poignantly see [MoWD](28%20Metagame%20of%20World%20Dynamics.md) and [Might With Right](29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md).

### How Employment Blocks Natural Selection

**Traditional System**: Employment as Exclusion
- It occupies 'a share of the industry' for a few hands without any ability for others to compete. It all goes through proxies and bureaucracy to then occupy a position. This isn't only employment, but more generally 'Expert Systems' and Categorical thinking: "This person solves and is responsible for [category]. Everyone else is not and totally disbarred". It cuts the possibility of acts in the real world into very limited and long processes by historical data or proxies like education/schooling/degrees to select what is allowed to happen in terms of acts. It is useful when you have to be able to justify any failure and remove responsibility from yourself. But it is very poor in steering a ship and dealing with reality. "What lunacy to hire a person falling between or outside [categories] that is [type] for that [function]". That causes it all to be stupid and brittle. Any attempt at using more information than the projective space of being [category] or [type] for the [function] results in being called not only irresponsible but also stupid and evil! (See [Neologistic Reality Cutting](30.%20neologistic-reality-cutting.md))
- On top of that, you get locking down of employees or interactors/trade-partners within a company and in the case they leave the company. A sort of willingness to take risk by having locked potential and persons down into a non-threatening position. This easily becomes a violation of MBC rule 3. (Free Somewhere i.e. you can't 'outside' your triad do any such domination; They can leave and be free -- without the burden of your accord. Also remember Rule 1 and 2 in terms of causing it. Free restricted by those two things. (Rest is nesting.. Not ubiquity law. Which allows for escape and exit to be free.) Cause and Effect 0 position Horns and Halos etc. etc. etc.)
    a. Work for utility company → Can't compete with utility
    b. Employed by AWS → Can't offer better compute solutions
    c. Contract with telecom → Can't improve the network (They have to let the binding law or contract run out, so they can stop what is stupid to them and develop upon the network. Sometimes ways around or cooperation with the telecom giant can be had. But it is usually with them getting the scalable profit and further positioning them as the masters in the domain - not by merit or excellence - but by position and law. Exit, escape, barriers, going free, etc. It helps. It really does. Simply say: Goodbye old world.)
    d. Hired by any firm → Can't use "their" infrastructure better; Despite 'their infrastructure' may largely have been invented by that very same person. Unable to develop upon it. But is forced to 'start over' and see if they can innovate as well in a new way. Which is unlikely - or at least very annoying to be forced out of one's invention by entrapment of 'becoming employed': Having your potential you express owned by others.

**The Artificial Barriers**:
- Non-compete agreements
- IP assignment clauses
- Exclusive infrastructure access
- Trade secret restrictions
- Customer relationship ownership
- "Company property" definitions

### The Absurdity

Consider the insanity:
- Network engineer sees inefficiency in routing → Can't fix it without quitting
- Power plant operator knows better scheduling → Contractually forbidden from implementing
- Data center technician has optimization idea → Must give it to employer or suppress it
- Delivery driver finds better routes → Can't start competing service using same roads

The person closest to the problem, most knowledgeable about the solution, is legally prevented from solving it!

## The Open Infrastructure Revolution

### Infrastructure as Evolutionary Substrate

In the new paradigm:
- Infrastructure or more generally Substrate becomes open to anyone (Trust Maps / Networks; Usually a civilization or even world level substrate will be common) who can use it better
- Employment status irrelevant to access rights; In fact employment is recommended illegal: Servitude by Contract. It is very bad for large scale Triads to have such binding within their massive zones. The point is dynamic, responsive exiting and rallying as a key metric of success that is "all things considered" holistic per subject. When you allow for Ocean or Sea wide 'contracts' that bind, then they can not 'go free' without leaving your civilization/sea/ocean.
- Will-Performance determines who routes through what (Not only performance, but subjective will-performance, Owner <-> utilizer <-> Utility-User. Whether this Owner part is totally void in your Triad is up to you. Perhaps you want only Pwnership. Perhaps you want Sovereign Owner of all substrate. Perhaps you want Utilizer/effiency-maker to 'conquer' also ownership of substrate. It is up to you. The point remains of 'functioning' being will-performance competition across substrate so long as 'trust' or more generally 'will' is sufficient to allow competiting in substrate.)
- Natural selection operates on all things of reality, not "firms" (abstractions of servitude and ownership).

### Real Examples

**Electricity Grid**
- **Old**: Only utility employees can manage grid operations
- **New**: Anyone who can route power more efficiently gains access
- Engineer at utility develops better algorithm? Can implement directly
- Competing implementations run simultaneously
- Best will-performance wins the routing (Where efficiency in metrics of watt in and out being as wasteless and cheap being 'useful' or sometimes 'correlated' with will-performance. But obviously: cheap can easily capture and correlate very poorly with will-performance. Having low heat dissipation or waste is perhaps more generally correlated, but you could imagine the method to make it requiring many processes or acts or use-of-scarce-resources on the planet that makes it highly anti-will-performant. The Curse of Low-d or projective analysis. When you don't use holistic measures and mechanisms like Natural Selection. Implicit versus Explicit. 'All Things Considered' Adaptive (See [Blob Classes](4%20blob_classes_discovery.md)) Explicits versus Categorical or A Metric Space Explicits (Ryan Faulk -- Basically, Ryan did a lot of work on Implicit Versus Explicit. I wrote a lot about it since 2020 or something. Then copied massively and the typical academia rats and 'public intellectuals' thieving the merit and so on. So whatever. You know them now. And Goodbye to them and their kind forever. (Basically Jewry And Intelligence derivatives of The West. Fare thee well you hateful bastards.)))

**Computing Infrastructure**
- **Old**: Only AWS employees can optimize AWS infrastructure; Or interoperate or complement AWS directly.
- **New**: Anyone can offer better scheduling for existing hardware; Or complementary hardware with software able to discover and utilize it. (As an example: extreme edge hardware (As an example see [Cohesion Net](6%20cohesionnet_use_case.md)))
- Your algorithm outperforms? Compute routes to your scheduler
- Hardware owner benefits from better utilization
- You profit from performance delta

**Network Routing**
- **Old**: Only telecom employees touch routing tables
- **New**: Anyone can propose better paths through existing fiber
- Your prediction of connectivity pathways reduces latency? Increases stability&robustness? Has way less bottleneck infrastructure use? Traffic prefers your routes
- Infrastructure owners earn more from efficiency
- You earn from improvement margin

## The Protocol Mechanics

### How Employment Becomes Irrelevant

```
Traditional Employment Logic:
IF employed_by(company) THEN exclusive_access(company_resources)
ELSE no_access

Natural Selection Logic:  
IF holistic-metric-by-proxy-of-human-will-performance(your_method) > ..-performance(current_method) 
THEN resources_flow_to(your_method)
REGARDLESS_OF employment_status
```

### The Beautiful Simplicity

Anyone can:
1. Observe inefficiency in any system
2. Develop better approach; Develop variants to be projected by protocol.. 
3. Offer it to the network; ..protocol onto substrate for coordinated and large-scale Natural Selection.
4. Get routed resources if superior; Routed resources in explosive fashion in any will-manifesting niche that can be found.
5. Grow based on will-performance; Have new substrate or 'building'/'production' made for your variant (or YOUR variants as in 'your utility' preferences your novel exotic new-production needing variants to be made with reinvestment; All in the particular protocol a substrate uses.).

No need to:
- Quit your job
- Get permission
- Sign contracts
- Transfer IP
- Request access

## Why This Destroys Corporate Control

### The Death of Artificial Scarcity

Corporations maintain control through:
- **Exclusive access**: Only employees can touch systems ("Can anyone improve my system? Or interoperate it with other systems to make it a better service?".. Response: "Well you have to go through half a year candidate pooling, then selecting a few persons you then spend a lot of money on, and perhaps they will be able to. If they can't then you try again or simply settle with the state of things". This is a tiny part to the Korea Parallel of Old versus New World.. I so want to NOT replace Old World. But take SHIT LAND and apply TheseSystemsTM upon it. Then laugh.)
- **Legal barriers**: Non-competes and IP assignment
- **Information asymmetry**: Hide how things really work
- **Permission structures**: Approval needed for changes

Natural selection destroys all of these:
- **Open/Trust/Trustless-metric access**: Based on performance not employment. (Plato on foundation or requirement of states is Philia amongst it citizens. Okay, civilization requires some level of metroversals (See [Kant Insights](15b_kant_insights_manifesto.md) but also it requires something less than enemy distinction between each other. And it requires some level of Trust to be efficient. If you cast the net of civilization too wide, you lose the utility of having a civilization. You could then say: concentric circles or nesting of civilization with different degrees of Trust that allows for such 'open access'. (See [Civilizational Emergence](./14%20civilizational_emergence.md) for a - perhaps - useful scale differentiation of daemonias (Metroversals fundamentally authentically true amongst persons of the Triad))))
- **Legal irrelevance**: Physics doesn't check contracts; Legal frameworks are largely not needed because:
    1. Larger scales Triads wants to allow for nesting freedom and not exclude in large Triad on disputes, differences or diversity below it too much. But to make room in space and time for them all; so long as they fit in the Large Scale Triad (civilizational or whatever) metroversal/framework/philosophy/daemonia.
    2. Small scale Triads has Sovereignty to simply "decide" without having to 'justify it'.
    3. Will-coalescence and Will-economics effects causes most things to be truly decentralized and yet organized and potent. What "democracy" of the west perhaps 'wanted to be'. (You tell me what the Intent(s) of those who ideaed from Renaissance into Liberal Democracies had.)
- **Transparent performance**: Results visible to all in this pathfinding/predictive/actualization layer sense. [Discovery OS](25%20discovery-os-expanded-into-broader-picture.md) being a useful part to it.
- **Permissionless innovation**: Better automatically wins; This is Yin-Yang love. Whatever you want to call it without using the word love. (Agape Philia Eros Pragma YY??). It is to state: I love new life and so I love death. It is to state: I love growth and so I love decay. And so on. You don't love Destruction for Desctructions sake. You love it for what it enables or transmutes into. Matter is. It can be this or become that. (All is ultimately zero-sum non-virtually). Monadism I have called Yin-Yang love. But perhaps a better word is there.

### The New Employment Reality

Employment transforms from:
- **Exclusion mechanism** → **Collaboration option**
- **Control structure** → **Coordination convenience**
- **Innovation prison** → **Resource pooling**
- **Competitive barrier** → **Collective enhancement** (aka. The utilizers and positioning - moves and countermoves - you make will have you win path-utility in will-manifestation of persons. But it isn't through "keeping out" those who want to optimize the substrate or coordinate for the civilization or holistically improve will-manifestation.)

## Real-World Transformation

### Scenario: Power Plant Evolution

**Traditional**: 
- Jane works at coal power plant
- Sees massive inefficiency in turbine scheduling
- Develops optimization algorithm on her own time
- Company claims ownership of idea
- Must either surrender it or quit to pursue
- If quits, can't access plant to implement; Will have to go through a journey - perhaps long - of getting to a similar position where someone is willing to 'let her implement it' without also capturing it and ownership of it; with some monetary compensation or employment with some vesting.
- Innovation dies or A company captures value against other companies in however holistically destructive manner that may unfold. ((Also for Other industries) race to bottom minimizing cost causing extreme conditions in much they do not optimize for. Or disruptive interaction between 'variants'/corporations-implementations-of-solution-to-some-demand.)

**Natural Selection**:
- Jane does work at coal power plant (What does it take 'all things considered' to do work at a coal power plant? or nuclear power plant? And also what kind of work? or access to facilities (Think catastrophe?))
- Sees inefficiency, develops algorithm
- Implements directly on plant systems (What does it take 'all things considered' to be trusted to implement or to have implemented for you an optimization on a power plant?)
- Algorithm performs 20% better
- Plant operations automatically prefer her scheduling
- Jane earns from performance improvement
- Plant earns from efficiency gain
- Other plants utilize her efficiency gains too (civilization profits from greater efficiency. While keeping Diversity of methods in mind and preference for rapid natural selection of other avenues or pathways to same will-manifestation. In the case of a Power Plant, it may then be prudent to not implement her particular method on many other systems, but instead allow for variant versions from start to finish of power plants. Be it different energy sources or methodologies. Each able to serve with different layers of their implementation as substrate environment that makes different variants upon each substrate layer better or worse will-performant. This allows for the many trajectories and parallel development and innovation. Instead of capital tendency to rush towards the trendy highest expected gain (through social-flocking, trends, macrotrends or authoritative analysis agencies) with some notion of 'diversification' (which usually mean domain hedging or countercorrelate hedging and sometimes merely different ships/corporations/triads diversification))
- Employment status ~~irrelevant~~ (illegal)

### The Cascading Effects

When employment can't block competition:
- Innovation explodes from those closest to problems
- Artificial inefficiencies can't persist (Which is endemic and pandemic (Consider the inefficiencies of Uganda..))
- Knowledge workers become free agents while ~~employed~~ solving tasks -- I mean manifesting will -- I mean will-coalescing in a quid quo pro fashion as normal employment otherwise usually is.
- Companies must share infrastructure or lose relevance (The modularity, responsiveness, holistic benefit to 'others' by doing robustness of NSS, interoperability, efficiencies, "you make better you grow with: open"-mentality and dynamism in Will-economic Will-Performance)
- Best ideas win regardless of origin

## The Trust Network Enabler

### Why Trust Networks Make This Possible

Traditional system needs employment controls because:
- No way to track who does what
- No consequences for bad behavior
- No reputation system across firms
- No performance measurement
- No quality assurance before being allowed causes adversarial-head-prying to attempt illucidation of the competency or suitability of the person to the position and responsibility.

Trust networks provide:
- **Identity**: Know who's offering what (via PoP)
- **Reputation**: Track performance history; Get no-nonsense plurality of will-performance-prediction to assess who is suitable. Including those trying to incorporate all 'potentials' and ability to 'deal with such unfortunate future unforseen circumstances'. As well as Latent Quantization of beliefs from persons about persons. Your beloved voting made 'all things belief' instead of 'belief in better choice of one of two leaders in 2024'. This allows for a 'soft technocracy' or any other \*-cracy variety you can think of. Where you get to do your own Networked or Map and weighing of persons and their 'votes' or 'espoused or inferred beliefs' about "whatever".
- **Consequences**: Bad actors lose utility-prediction position. They may also explicitly lose beliefs or predictions concerning trust or trustworthiness; Which is foundational in most interaction. "What am I allowed to?". What use is my "word" or "prediction" or "predicted as capable of doing this or that for someone".
- **Measurement**: Actual will-manifesting results spread like 'intelligence flow in Trust Networks' or like 'gossip' in trustless will-fields.

This enables open access without chaos. It enables depth of compentency assessment and coverage of potential "employees" (old term) or will-coalescents/task-solvers (new terms). (And no you don't need to rely on the systems entirely. Whereupon breaking down chaos. There will obviously be noting of who is good at what without the system. But the system allows it discovered. Then in the absence of it. It isn't like everyone suddenly forgets what they are good at, or who their will-coalescents for different tasks were. They may. But they certainly don't have to. Nor should we expect them to. Especially concerning their own acts.. Besides NSS tries to make the replacement system exponentially growing to replace the failing and to exist in extreme diversity and with no wanted limit in 'pre-image/pre-projection' space)

## The New Competitive Landscape

### From Firms to Functions

Competition shifts from:
- Company vs company → Method vs method (Utilization becomes detached from ownership. Which is also the only sensible thing, and which companies would want to do, had they thought about it. They try to, with not doing everything themselves, but instead hiring others to utilize it for them, but they don't have a systematic way to allow for coverage and proper assessment of who does what better. They certainly did not have a way to make it serve 'their whole or greater goods of theirs' nor Whatever that word Duty refers to (See [Kant](./15b_kant_insights_manifesto.md) or Hegel))
- Employer vs employer → Performance vs performance
- Organization charts → Capability graphs
- Corporate hierarchy → Will-Functional (Including Civilization-Functional, Triad-Functional -- Which may be embedding space by Triad Sovereign domination. I.e. Will of Sovereign (Which may be willed by humans to be system-as-sovereign (though possibility of runawaycy or stagnancy)) becomes embedding space for rest of substrate to will-within or will-align within. Again: It is all recursive. Say, A Sovereign/dominus dominates will within Dominum of his. But in turn his dominum is under natural selection pressure, in particular Rally effects and will-economic effects and nesting constraints of his own. Is he subject to another superject or not? Natural Selection Crucible. And across domains or reality or projective frameworks: Polymorphic Crucible. It is much easier if implemented to understand. (So, again, "make room" Pandora's Box? Who knows. But at least it is easier to understand then)) excellence.

### Success in the New World

**Old Strategy**: 
- Join company/co-operation/organization/institution
- Climb and Rise through ranks
- Control resources
- Block competition (especially the case in political institutions like states. Where domination is so all-encompassing.)
- Extract rent

**New Strategy**:
- Identify inefficiency anywhere
- Develop better solution
- Implement on NSS-accessible infrastructure/substrate
- Grow through performance
- Continuously evolve

## The Ultimate Liberation

This change liberates:
- **Human potential**: Use your knowledge wherever it helps; Discover where your niche of fulfilment for yourself and in interaction with others could be or is.
- **Infrastructure efficiency**: NSS Diversity and Human Constraints (Things like, I know 'his method is better' but he is 'my enemy' and therefore I refuse (to let him apply/deploy his subaiddamons in my substrate). No matter what. Which is totally fine in this system. It is merely another layer of Diversity.) view of Best methods always available.
- **Innovation speed**: No corporate approval needed (Individual Human Will unpolutted in contestations with others: But hyper empowered to instead function in tandem with or coordination or symbiosis - coalescence with - others. To avoid contestation by mere distancing in actuality. Potentially total disconnection. Potentially in spacetime (Like time sharing same space; coalescing at different times). Potentially in Space.)
- **Resource allocation**: Flows to NSS-best use automatically
- **Economic opportunity**: Anyone can improve anything

## Conclusion: The End of Employment Gatekeeping

The dissolution of employment barriers represents the ushering in of the final liberation of humanity -- while simultaneously being the liberation of human productive potential. When:

- Any person can improve any system
- Employment status doesn't determine access
- Infrastructure opens to performance
- Natural selection operates freely
- Innovation emerges from anywhere

We achieve true economic democracy—not through regulation or revolution, but through the simple protocol of performance-based access.

"The sufficient engineerful" at the utility can fix the grid directly. "The developing actful trust-accessing" perusing Amazon can optimize the cloud immediately ("sufficient" trust-accessing). "The driving person with a FedEx-equivalency vehicle coalescing logistics" can improve logistics instantly. Not by quitting, not by asking permission, but by performing better.

**Employment becomes illegal in many large scale Triads; Or contract-binding large scale Triad-wide becomes unlawed. Employment and contracts remains some places but simply as one way to coordinate human effort, not a barrier to innovation, but an old vestige to those who feel too uncomfortable and insecure without a corporation backing their economic justification and stake in the world. Infrastructure becomes substrate for evolution, not property for exclusion. Performance becomes the only access credential needed.**

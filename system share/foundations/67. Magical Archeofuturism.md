# Magical Archeofuturism
*Then the world departed from opaque technology that was an affront to our eyes.*
*Then the world began to see vision first and technology as underlying*
*Then the sharing was empowerment, not power*
*Then the world became story telling and raw aesthetics*
*Then the awe of magic began to creep upon the sensation of persons*
*The Tower of Powers stood mighty projected their magic onto the World*

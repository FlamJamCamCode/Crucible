# Coordinated Genetic Supply Networks: When Competitors Collaborate on Evolution

## The Profound Insight: Cooperative Competition Through Shared Evolution

When multiple suppliers coordinate their genetic algorithms while searching for optimal supply routes, they discover synergies that make the whole network more profitable than the sum of its parts. This isn't collusion - it's evolutionary mutualism.

## The Traditional Problem: Isolated Optimization

### Single Supplier Evolution
```python
# Danish Wind Farm A - Evolving alone
class IsolatedWindFarmGA:
    def evolve_route(self):
        # Only sees its own capacity and customers
        # Misses network effects
        # Duplicates infrastructure
        # Suboptimal for everyone
```

**Problems with Isolation**:
- Can't see complementary supply patterns
- Builds redundant infrastructure
- Misses temporal coordination opportunities
- Genetic algorithm has limited search space

## The Coordinated Evolution Revolution

### Multiple Suppliers Sharing Genetic Search

```python
class CoordinatedSupplyEvolution:
    """
    Multiple energy suppliers share their genetic algorithms
    while competing on execution
    """

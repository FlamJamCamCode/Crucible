# Scientists turned dead spiders into robot grippers

Scientists at Rice University have pioneered "necrobotics" by **literally turning dead wolf spiders into functional robotic grippers** that can lift 130% of their body weight. This groundbreaking research, which won the 2023 Ig Nobel Prize, started when researchers found a dead spider in their lab hallway and thought, "What if we could make this into a robot?" - and then actually did it.

The discovery emerged from a simple observation about spider anatomy. Unlike humans who use muscles to move their limbs, spiders operate like biological hydraulic machines. They pump fluid through their bodies to extend their legs, which is why **dead spiders naturally curl into a ball** when they lose this pressure. Rice University engineers Daniel Preston and Te Faye Yap realized they could hijack this system by becoming the spider's new hydraulic pump.

## Dead spiders make surprisingly effective robots

The transformation process reads like instructions from a mad scientist's notebook, yet it's remarkably straightforward. Researchers insert a needle into the spider's body cavity, seal it with **a tiny dab of superglue**, and connect it to a syringe. Puffing air in extends all eight legs simultaneously; releasing air makes them curl inward to grasp objects. The entire conversion takes about 10 minutes from finding a dead spider to having a functional bio-robot.

What makes this absurd is how well it works. The spider-bots demonstrated remarkable durability, with **one specimen lasting through 1,000 open-close cycles** before showing signs of wear. They can lift objects weighing 130% of their body weight, though some overachievers lifted much more. The researchers envision applications in microelectronics assembly, where the delicate spider legs could handle components too small for conventional robots. Plus, when you're done with your spider-bot, you can simply compost it - making it perhaps the world's first fully biodegradable robot.

## Exploding paper bags next to cats on cows

While necrobotics represents cutting-edge absurdity, the history of ridiculous research stretches back decades. In 1941, scientists Fordyce Ely and William Petersen designed an experiment that sounds like a rural prank gone wrong. They wanted to understand how cows produce milk, so naturally they **placed cats on cows' backs and exploded paper bags next to them**.

The results were spectacularly anticlimactic - the paper bag explosions had absolutely no effect on milk production. Yet this apparent failure led to genuine discoveries about the nervous system's role in milk ejection, revealing it as a conditioned reflex controlled by the balance between adrenaline and a hormone called pitocin. When the researchers posthumously won the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize in Biology, the ceremony featured **Nobel laureates smashing paper bags next to a stuffed cat** placed on a volunteer dressed as a cow.

## Plants that want to be plastic

Perhaps the most philosophically disturbing discovery comes from the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize in Botany. Researchers found that some **real plants actually mimic the shapes of nearby artificial plastic plants**. Think about that - a living organism looks at a fake, manufactured version of itself and decides to imitate the imitation. It's the botanical equivalent of getting plastic surgery to look more like your action figure.

This discovery supports the controversial concept of "plant vision," suggesting plants can somehow perceive and respond to visual stimuli in their environment. The implications challenge our fundamental assumptions about plant intelligence and what it means to "see" without eyes.

## Serious science wearing a clown nose

These studies exemplify the spirit of the Ig Nobel Prizes, which honor research that "first makes people laugh, then makes them think." Founded in 1991, these awards celebrate legitimate scientific inquiry that happens to sound completely ridiculous. Past winners have investigated **whether toast really falls butter-side down**, the optimal way to dunk a biscuit, and why fingernails on a blackboard make us cringe.

What makes these studies valuable isn't their absurdity but their genuine scientific merit. Necrobotics could revolutionize small-scale manufacturing with biodegradable robots. The cow study advanced our understanding of mammalian hormone regulation. The plant mimicry research opens new frontiers in understanding non-animal cognition. These researchers didn't set out to be funny - they followed their curiosity wherever it led, even if that meant sticking needles into dead spiders or terrorizing cows with exploding bags.

## Conclusion

The beauty of these wonderfully stupid studies lies in their earnest pursuit of knowledge. When Daniel Preston saw that dead spider in the hallway, he didn't think "that's gross" - he thought "that's potential robotic material." This willingness to ask absurd questions and pursue them with scientific rigor has given us **robot spiders that work on their first try**, insights into mammalian biology through cat-cow-paper bag interactions, and the mind-bending realization that plants might be watching us.

Perhaps the greatest lesson from necrobotics and its ridiculous research siblings is that innovation often comes from the most unexpected places. Sometimes advancing human knowledge means building robots out of dead arachnids, and sometimes that's exactly the kind of creative thinking science needs. After all, in a world where dead spiders can become robots and plants can have identity crises about plastic imposters, who's to say what counts as too absurd to study?

# The Loneliest God

Marcus discovered his ability on a Tuesday, during a particularly mundane therapy session with Dr. Reeves. He'd been seeing her for three years about his chronic loneliness—the kind that felt like drowning in air, surrounded by eight billion people who might as well have been mannequins.

"I just want someone to actually *see* me," he was saying, when he felt something shift in his mind. A door opening. A signal broadcasting.

Dr. Reeves blinked slowly, then smiled with an warmth he'd never seen from her before. "Marcus, you're absolutely fascinating. I find myself thinking about our conversations all week."

The words felt wrong in her mouth. Too eager. Too immediate.

He tested it gently over the following weeks. A barista lingering to chat. A bus driver going out of their way to help. A neighbor who suddenly found him interesting. Always subtle. Always leaving room for doubt.

But the doubt evaporated when he reached further.

The reach was like stretching a muscle he didn't know he had. First across the city. Then the state. Then continent by continent until every human consciousness on Earth existed within his mental grasp—eight billion minds like candle flames he could cup in his hands, their light visible to him alone.

The loneliness didn't disappear. It *amplified*.

Because now he could have anything—any relationship, any love, any friendship—and it would mean nothing. Every smile would be his creation. Every "I love you" would be his own voice echoing back to him from hijacked lips.

He tried leaving people untouched, seeking authentic connection, but the knowledge of what he could do poisoned every interaction. When someone was kind, he wondered if he'd influenced them unconsciously. When someone was cold, he fought the urge to warm them up. The barrier between his will and others' became increasingly meaningless.

The worst part was that people weren't happier under his influence. Oh, they could be made to feel happy, but underneath—in the parts of their consciousness he could see but tried not to touch—they remained fundamentally unchanged. Depressed people stayed depressed, just with artificial smiles painted over their despair. Anxious people stayed anxious, just with their worries temporarily muted.

It felt like being the loneliest person alive, with the power to pretend otherwise.

Then he found Sarah.

She was standing on the Queensboro Bridge at 3 AM, her consciousness a black hole of despair so complete it made him pause his global scan. Seventeen years old. Parents who'd never understood her. A lifetime of feeling defective, broken, unwanted. Tonight was supposed to be the end.

He could have simply adjusted her neurochemistry, flipped her mood, sent her home happy. But he'd done that before with others, and the underlying issues always returned. Band-aids on severed arteries.

Instead, he tried something different.

He crafted her an experience.

Not fake happiness, but a rich, complex, beautiful movie playing directly in her consciousness. She was still herself, still standing on the bridge, but simultaneously she was also the protagonist of the most compelling story ever told. A story where she mattered. Where her quirks weren't flaws but features. Where her sensitivity was a superpower, her differences gifts to be celebrated.

She experienced falling in love with someone who saw her completely. She felt the warmth of friendship with people who understood her. She lived through adventures where her unique perspective saved the day. Years of rich, meaningful life condensed into moments—but moments that felt entirely real and satisfying.

When it ended, she was crying. But not from despair.

"I... I want to feel that again," she whispered to the empty air. "Not right now, but... someday. I want to see if I can make some of that real."

She stepped back from the railing.

Marcus felt something he hadn't experienced in months: genuine joy. Not because he'd controlled her, but because he'd *given* her something beautiful. And her response—her choice to live, to hope—was entirely her own.

He started seeking them out. The desperate ones. The ones standing on bridges and rooftops and bathroom floors with bottles of pills. He gave them each a movie. Always different, always tailored to their specific hearts, always beautiful.

The side effect—though he told himself it was a side effect—was that afterwards, they thought about him.

Not Marcus specifically. They didn't know his name or face. But they carried a sense of... presence. A feeling that somewhere in the universe was someone who understood them completely. Someone who had seen into their deepest selves and found them worthy of love.

They would go through their days with a strange comfort, an inexplicable sense of being known. In their loneliest moments, they felt less alone. And when they reached out to others—which they did more often now—they carried with them an echo of the unconditional acceptance they'd experienced in their movie.

Marcus told himself he was helping them. And he was. Suicide rates plummeted. Depression-related hospitalizations dropped. People were forming deeper connections, taking better care of themselves, finding meaning in life.

But he also knew that buried in every movie he crafted was his own desperate need to be known. Each story was a love letter from his soul to theirs, an attempt to create the authentic intimacy he could never have directly. They felt loved because *he* loved them—the real them, the broken beautiful them he'd seen in their darkest moments.

It was the closest thing to genuine relationship he could achieve. Love at a distance. Connection through gift-giving. Intimacy without contamination.

The irony wasn't lost on him. He'd become God to eight billion people, but the only authentic interactions he could have were with those who didn't know he existed.

Sometimes, late at night, he would check in on his movie recipients. Sarah was in college now, studying art therapy. David had started a support group for other veterans. Mei had reconciled with her family and become a teacher. They were all thriving, all connected to others, all carrying within them the knowledge that they were worthy of love.

They couldn't love him back—didn't even know he existed—but they loved others better because of what he'd given them. And in watching them love, in seeing the ripples of connection spreading outward from each person he'd touched, Marcus found something that felt almost like being loved in return.

It wasn't the relationship he'd dreamed of. But it was real. It was meaningful. And it was his.

He was still the loneliest god who ever lived. But he was no longer drowning.

In the space between authentic connection and beneficial manipulation, he'd found something else entirely: love expressed through letting go. Intimacy achieved through distance. The closest thing to genuine relationship that someone with his power could ever hope to have.

And maybe, Marcus thought as he watched Sarah laugh with her friends in a café half a world away, maybe that was enough.

Maybe it had to be.

Because the alternative—never touching anyone's life at all—would have left both him and them infinitely poorer.

At least this way, everyone got to experience love. Even if his came disguised as their own self-worth, reflected back at them through the most beautiful mirrors he could create.

Even if he remained forever on the outside of every relationship he made possible.

Even if the price of helping everyone else connect was accepting that he never could.

The loneliest god closed his eyes and, across eight billion minds, whispered a prayer of gratitude for the privilege of being able to love without being known, to give without receiving, to connect by staying forever separate.

It was the closest thing to authentic relationship his power would allow.

And perhaps, in its own strange way, it was beautiful.

Early Christians generally believed that the Second Coming of Christ (Parousia) was imminent and would occur within their own lifetimes or shortly thereafter. This belief was rooted in several New Testament passages, such as:  

1. **Jesus' Teachings:** In the Gospels, Jesus spoke of his return as something that could happen soon. For example, in **Matthew 24:34**, he says, *"Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."*  

2. **Pauline Epistles:** Paul often spoke as if the return of Christ was near. In **1 Thessalonians 4:15-17**, he writes that "we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord," indicating that he and his contemporaries expected to witness it.  

3. **General Expectation:** The Book of Revelation, written at the end of the first century, also reflects an urgent expectation, with phrases like *"I am coming soon"* (Revelation 22:20).  

However, as time passed and the anticipated return did not occur, Christian theology adapted. By the late first and early second centuries, some leaders began to interpret the delay as part of a divine plan, emphasizing vigilance and readiness rather than immediate expectation. This shift paved the way for the more allegorical or spiritual interpretations of the Second Coming that developed in later Christian thought.

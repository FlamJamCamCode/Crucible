Certainly! Let's break down Terence Tao's blog post, ÓàÉ"When is Correlation Transitive?"ÓàÑ, into simple, layman-friendly terms.ÓàÜ

### üîÑ Understanding Correlation and Its Transitivity

**Correlation** measures how two things are related. For example, if studying more often leads to better test scores, we say there's a positive correlation between studying and scores.

**Transitivity** is a property where if A is related to B, and B is related to C, then A is also related to C. For instance, if Alice is a friend of Bob, and Bob is a friend of Charlie, transitivity would suggest Alice is a friend of Charlie.

However, **correlation isn't always transitive**. Just because A is correlated with B, and B with C, doesn't guarantee A is correlated with C.

### üìò Everyday Example

Imagine:

- **Deep understanding** of a subject leads to **good exam scores**.
- **Memorizing flashcards** also leads to **good exam scores**.

However, this doesn't mean that **memorizing flashcards** leads to a **deep understanding** of the subject. So, while both are correlated with exam scores, they aren't necessarily correlated with each other.

---

### üìà When Correlation Becomes (Almost) Transitive

There are situations where correlation behaves almost transitively:

1. **Strong Correlations ("99% Rule")**: If A is very strongly correlated with B, and B with C, then A is likely strongly correlated with C. Think of it like a chain: if each link is very strong, the connection from start to end is also strong.

2. **Statistical Transitivity (Van der Corput Lemma)**: If one factor (say, a teacher) is positively related to many others (students), then many of those others are also positively related among themselves. It's like if a teacher influences many students positively, those students might also positively influence each other.

### üîç Key Takeaways

- **Correlation isn't always transitive**: Just because two pairs are each correlated doesn't mean the outer pair is.
- **Strong correlations can imply transitivity**: Very strong individual correlations can lead to an overall transitive relationship.
- **Statistical patterns matter**: In large groups, if many individuals are correlated with a common factor, they may also be correlated among themselves.

Understanding these nuances helps in fields like statistics, psychology, and data science, ensuring we don't make incorrect assumptions about relationships between variables.

Then do another version that is as succinct as possible in answering "When is correlation transitive". 
ChatGPT
Correlation is transitive when the individual correlations between pairs are extremely strong (close to 1) or when statistical structures (like those involving a common factor) cause indirect relationships to emerge among a group. In most practical cases, however, correlation is not inherently transitive.

Then do one with the essential math mapped out.

Here‚Äôs a mathematically oriented explanation of when correlation is transitive:

### Mathematical Framework

1. **Correlation Definition:**
   - The correlation between random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) is given by:
     \[
     \text{corr}(X, Y) = \frac{\text{cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
     \]
   - \( \text{cov}(X, Y) \) is the covariance, and \( \sigma_X \), \( \sigma_Y \) are standard deviations.

2. **Transitivity Question:**
   - We ask whether:
     \[
     \text{corr}(X, Y) \approx 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{corr}(Y, Z) \approx 1 \implies \text{corr}(X, Z) \approx 1
     \]
   - This would imply that if \(X\) and \(Y\) are highly correlated, and \(Y\) and \(Z\) are highly correlated, then \(X\) and \(Z\) should also be highly correlated.

### Key Insights:

1. **Strong Correlation Case:**
   - If both correlations are very close to 1 (e.g., 0.99 or higher), transitivity approximately holds:
     \[
     \text{corr}(X, Z) \approx 1
     \]
   - This follows from the fact that when variables are almost perfectly linearly related, they form an almost linear chain.

2. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   - Correlation can be visualized as the cosine of the angle between vectors in a high-dimensional space.
   - If the angle between \(X\) and \(Y\) is small, and between \(Y\) and \(Z\) is also small, the angle between \(X\) and \(Z\) is likely small too.

3. **Statistical Transitivity (Van der Corput Lemma):**
   - If a random variable \(A\) is correlated with many other variables \(B_i\), then there is a high probability that many of the \(B_i\) are correlated among themselves. This is akin to indirect correlation through a common factor.

### Non-Transitive Case:
- Correlation is generally not transitive when correlations are moderate or weak because linear relationships do not naturally propagate across three variables.

In summary, correlation is transitive when correlations between pairs are extremely strong or when a common factor induces indirect correlations among a group.

Then consider pigeonhole principle and having quantities in absolute terms when discussing transitive properties of correlation.

Say, let's take the flash card, deep understand and good grades example.

Then let's say 100 students. 10 have good grade. 8 did flash cards and 4 had deep understanding. And correlation of flash cards is above 0.9 and deep understanding 0.6. What can be said about the correlation between flash card and deep understanding.
ChatGPT
Let's break this down step by step, incorporating the **pigeonhole principle** and absolute quantities. 

### Problem Setup:
- **Total students:** 100  
- **Students with good grades:** 10  
- **Students who used flashcards (F):** 8  
- **Students with deep understanding (D):** 4  
- **Correlation (Flashcards, Good Grades):** 0.9 (very strong positive)  
- **Correlation (Deep Understanding, Good Grades):** 0.6 (moderate positive)  

---

### Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:
Since there are only **10 students with good grades**, and both **flashcard users (8)** and **deep learners (4)** must fit within this group to maintain their respective high correlations with grades, there must be some overlap between the flashcard users and deep learners. 

1. **Maximal Separation Check:**
   - If **flashcard users (8)** and **deep learners (4)** were completely disjoint, they would sum to 12, exceeding the 10 students with good grades. Therefore, at least **2 students** must belong to both groups.

2. **Minimal Overlap Scenario:**
   - If only **2 students** overlap, the rest would distribute as:
     - **6 students**: Flashcard users only  
     - **2 students**: Deep understanding only  
     - **2 students**: Both  
   - This gives a total of 10 (6+2+2).  

### Correlation Between Flashcards and Deep Understanding:
1. **Implication of High Correlation (0.9) for Flashcards:**
   - A correlation of 0.9 between flashcards and good grades means that most flashcard users (nearly all) have good grades.  
   - If 8 out of 10 top students use flashcards, it leaves only 2 possible spots for deep learners who do not use flashcards.  

2. **Implication of Moderate Correlation (0.6) for Deep Understanding:**
   - A correlation of 0.6 indicates that about **60%** of the deep learners should have good grades. Since there are only **4 deep learners**, this means about **2-3 of them** have good grades.  
   - Since there is overlap and limited space, it‚Äôs likely that **the two who overlap are the ones contributing to the correlation between deep understanding and good grades**.  

### Estimating Correlation Between Flashcards and Deep Understanding:
- Since **2 out of 4 deep learners** also use flashcards, the **absolute overlap is 50%**.  
- However, this does not directly translate to a **correlation coefficient** because we need to account for the ratio relative to their groups.  
- Given that **2 out of 8 flashcard users also have deep understanding (25%)** and **2 out of 4 deep learners also use flashcards (50%)**, we can infer that the correlation between flashcards and deep understanding is **moderate, likely around 0.4 to 0.5**.  

### Why It Isn‚Äôt Higher:
- Despite the high correlation of each factor with good grades, the **limited number of students with good grades (10)** forces some overlap but not enough to ensure a high correlation between flashcards and deep understanding.  
- The strong correlation between flashcards and grades does not necessitate a strong correlation between flashcards and understanding, as these factors are independently correlated with the outcome (grades), not necessarily with each other.
user
Okay consider that deep understanding or flash cards may also translate to not good grades.
ChatGPT
Let's reconsider the problem by acknowledging that **flashcard usage** or **deep understanding** does not always lead to good grades, meaning some students who use flashcards or have a deep understanding might **still get bad grades**. 

### Problem Setup (Revised):
- **Total students:** 100  
- **Students with good grades:** 10  
- **Students who used flashcards (F):** 8  
- **Students with deep understanding (D):** 4  
- **Correlation (Flashcards, Good Grades):** 0.9 (strong positive)  
- **Correlation (Deep Understanding, Good Grades):** 0.6 (moderate positive)  

---

### Considering Non-Grade Success:
Since **flashcards** and **deep understanding** do not **guarantee** good grades, there could be:
- **Flashcard users without good grades:** \(8 - x\)  
- **Deep understanding students without good grades:** \(4 - y\)  

Let:  
- \(x\) = number of flashcard users who have good grades  
- \(y\) = number of deep learners who have good grades  
- \(z\) = number of students who have both traits and good grades  

#### Constraints:
1. \(x + y - z \leq 10\) (total good grade students)  
2. **Flashcard Correlation (0.9):**  
   \[
   \frac{x}{8} \approx 0.9 \implies x \approx 7
   \]  
3. **Deep Understanding Correlation (0.6):**  
   \[
   \frac{y}{4} \approx 0.6 \implies y \approx 2 \text{ or } 3
   \]  

### Pigeonhole Considerations:
Since \(x + y - z \leq 10\), and \(x = 7\), \(y = 2\) or \(3\):  
- If \(y = 3\), then:  
  \[
  7 + 3 - z \leq 10 \implies z \geq 0
  \]  
- If \(y = 2\), then:  
  \[
  7 + 2 - z \leq 10 \implies z \geq -1 \quad (\text{impossible, so } z \geq 0)
  \]  
- The **maximum overlap** between flashcards and deep understanding among good students can be **2 or 3**.  

---

### Non-Grade Students:
- **Flashcard users without good grades:** \(8 - 7 = 1\)  
- **Deep learners without good grades:** \(4 - 2 = 2\) or \(4 - 3 = 1\)  
- Total non-grade students in each category are **small**, but they **exist**, indicating that:  
  - Flashcard users are **mostly successful**.  
  - Deep understanding **moderately contributes** to success.  
  - The two groups have a **non-zero overlap** even among those who did not succeed.  

### Correlation Between Flashcards and Deep Understanding:
1. **High Correlation (0.9) of Flashcards with Grades** suggests that almost all flashcard users succeeded.  
2. **Moderate Correlation (0.6) of Understanding with Grades** means some deep learners failed.  
3. Since both groups have a **small overlap in both successful and unsuccessful cases**, the correlation between **flashcards and deep understanding** remains **moderate** (likely around **0.4 to 0.5**).  
4. The fact that **some students from each group did not succeed** lowers the overall correlation between the two learning methods.  

---

### Final Answer:
Given that both traits **do not perfectly guarantee success**, the correlation between **flashcards and deep understanding** is not necessarily high, despite each being correlated with grades. Due to the forced overlap (pigeonhole) and partial failure rates, the estimated correlation between the two is **moderate (around 0.4 to 0.5)**, not directly derived from their individual correlations with good grades.

In Friedrich Engels' *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific*, he articulates the concept of socialism by highlighting the contradiction in capitalist production:

> "Production has become a social act. Exchange and appropriation continue to be individual acts, the acts of individuals. The social product is appropriated by the individual capitalist. Fundamental contradiction, whence arise all the contradictions in which our present-day society moves, and which modern industry brings to light." citeturn0search1

Engels further elaborates that although production has become socialized, the products are still appropriated by individuals, namely the capitalists:

> "The means of production, and production itself, had become in essence socialized. But they were subjected to a form of appropriation which presupposes the private production of individuals, under which, therefore, every one owns his own product and brings it to market." citeturn0search2

This contradiction between socialized production and private appropriation is central to Engels' critique of capitalism and his vision for socialism.

Got it — you want a no-nonsense, unapologetic declaration of a "socialism victory" kind of vibe? Like a rallying cry or a statement of triumph? Something bold, direct, and uncompromising? 

Here’s a quick stab at that energy:

**"As punishment for the failures of capitalism, we declare the victory of socialism: where work is socialized, profits are shared, and the people reclaim the fruits of their collective labor."**

Would you want something more poetic, historical-sounding, or maybe a modern militant tone? Or maybe a quote-inspired battle cry that channels Engels’ spirit?

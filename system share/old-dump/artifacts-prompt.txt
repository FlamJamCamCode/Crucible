You didn't generate the artifact.  

You time out, so instead we split the document into many small documents that you can manage to edit in time. 

Don't generate any without asking first. 

For this prompt you are to only make a list of artifacts you want to create. 

Then we go through each of them generating the artifacts of them.

The initial artifact document I uploaded remains merely as your context-window document to grasp what I mean or want somewhat. 

Do the initial splitting of the document into what artifact you want to create.

And take most of the morphism transmorphism and neologies into its own section/artifact/booklet that is referenced.

There is a lot of "specifics" interlaced with the introductory succinct format and general ideas. We will merely make reference to specific or particulars during those general terms or succinct introductory parts. Keep this in mind.

Also keep in mind the body of work we develop should be "self-contained", in that it will have to contain enough information to bring a person or fresh ai system from not knowing anything we've discussed and into having a pretty good idea of it all.

Make several artifacts that are particular "use cases" or applications of the system to a domain of interest. 

As an example: The Health, Computational space or CohesionNet as an example of a utility of data-flow on planet.   

Also where you show how High Leverage Terraformation can play into this. Where such an actor, can cause adoption of a particular protocol, which then enables certain anti-market-direction functioning to be compensatedly implemented in it. Like "deamplifying all space in emergencies or Trusted Authority bandwidth space requests" and so on. Such that a very large frequency range can be used commercially or privately (not only 2.4 and 5.2GHz as well as FM band 88-108MHz, but instead 44-1THz as commercial and private use but orchestrated by a protocol consensus that one plays with or suffer trust consequences by those wanting to play by the protocol and made anti-market by such things as putting extreme value on catastrophies remedies functioning and other such things, such as "life-endagered or medical emergency can deamplify others by protocol signals to allow their signals uninterferred lossless") 

""" **Types of Coalescence Gossipers**: * **Romance whisperers**: Amazing at predicting romantic resonance * **Business matchmakers**: Excel at finding co-founders and collaborators * **Creative catalysts**: Spot artistic collaborations before they happen * **Conflict preventers**: Experts at detecting and routing around dissonance * **Serendipity architects**: Create unexpected but delightful encounters """  

So while it may be, that it is categorical, it will most likely not be, due to this blob class aspect, and having overlap of many such "categories" and their probabilities of occurring.

So it is blob classes all things considered again. And coalesence actors get this blob class effect emergently by gossip perturbations that all in all provides very nebulous feature space of hints of who and unclear why. All in all they become good at using these blob classed gossip hints for their own blob classifications of gossipers and types of hints all things considered...  Basically whenever you do a category of something. Assume that is not who it will be. It will perhaps have a neologized cut later that we can use a category. But the categories we know do not cut coalesence prediction well. "Should these and those get together we get these blob classes of will fulfilment spiking high. So we perturb their AR experience proportionally."  And this is not to say that there aren't utility to be had in the dimension of human tangibility like romantic coalesence predictor. Both in terms of collecting the "right gossip" and in terms of good algorithms or learned models; but also in terms of "being a trustworthy and skillful person to share some relevant data towards an aim like romantic relations. Such that they can make better prediction for you, and perturb the gossip network such that coalesence with the right folks outside their 'customer base' also manage to coalesece with you" And  more. Much more.  Also. We create a vocabulary appendix or first section after index. Where words used in private-language ways, or neologisms are defined or explained.  So Blob Class (BCs) explanatory synonymish names: We say Predictive-Redux-Cut-Categories (PRCCs) or maybe Subjective-Exotic-Selectors (SES). The idea here is, when you say a category, like "romance", then you make a predicate selector of things of reality and their interrelation. Then certain interrelations or things the predicate function or selector would say in or outside category with. This is very very brittle in terms of good predictive capacity. 

It doesn't cut reality at its predictive joints. It isn't dynamic and modular, it doesn't adapt to what really was predictive, what combinations of phenomena really did manage to let us know where noumena flowed and made future phenomena predictable.

(Adding two documents for you about Daemonias and Kant. Again assume there may be misunderstandings due to them being AI generated and concepts that are named differently or talked about slightly different but are trying to grasp a concepts I've discussed with you about)

Daemonia document also relate some consequences of the fundamentals of inequality of daemons in man. (Ai mirror of your daemon being called Aiddaemon)

Some context for Kant document.

"""

It doesn't state all must agree. It states all are fundamentally equal, and from that things like uniformity or universality of the beautiful is deducible, or potentially things like there not being anything beautiful tabula raza, but one can learn to find a thing beautiful or not. That what is equal in us, is that we have no taste. Many postulates can be made about the human condition, but their fundamental is one of equality, and so whatever they postulate, it must encompass everyone.

Perhaps bring the point about Liberalism being born of kant's universalism, but taking that which is universal to be the negation of anything bound or binding in man to be their premise. Which coincidentally then states that the equality in man, that which is universal, is negation of universal domain specifics. Like beauty. So in a way Liberalism uses Kant to argue against everything Kant believed was universal in man. So.. Kant declared ways to figure out or at least argued for things being objectively aesthetic or beautiful, universally beautiful across rational or sentient or reasonable creatures. So he "didn't quite declare". But liberalism, uses universalism in tabula raza of man as the undermining wedge for any other universal in man. But as a universal. As a wedge against any claim to having a taste, fundamentally. The Tasteless Man Morality.

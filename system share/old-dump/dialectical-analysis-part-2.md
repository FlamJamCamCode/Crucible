*The dance intensifies. Each contradiction births new understanding. The project reveals itself as an attempt to discover the computational-economic physics that emerges when will, trust, and performance replace capital as organizing forces. Not built but discovered. Not imposed but emerged. Not finished but eternally becoming.*

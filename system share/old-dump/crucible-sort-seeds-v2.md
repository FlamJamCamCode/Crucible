# Crucible Project: Complementary Sort Seeds (Version 2)

## Transition Architecture Seeds

1. **To: Bridge Builders from Old World** - Ought not attack the system directly, grow alongside it. Build parallel infrastructure while old crumbles. Like hermit crab finding or growing its new shell before leaving old. Exit gradually as new world proves superior. Violence perpetuates exponential trauma patterns and retaliation: So messy.

2. **To: Legacy System Interfacers** - Create translation layers between old and new. Bank accounts to tracking indebtedness-states and holistic beliefs about each other in your Trusted Circles (This is human level ground work to seed the system when it goes live).Geographic address to trust coordinates (New locality that probably will converge in spacetime time and time again). Institutional Trust (Like a Ph.D. from harvard or a regulative institution of state) to holistic Trust beliefs. Smooth transitions prevent chaos.

3. **To: Institutional Antibodies** - Expect fierce resistance from those who profit from current system. Regulators, gatekeepers, rent-seekers (especially of infrastructure and toll between will-market matching) will attack. Build antifragile - attacks make you stronger. Use their energy against them like aikido. Make a target they can't punch through.

4. **To: Timeline Architects** - Year 1-3: Early adopters proof the concept. Year 3-4: Network effects begin. Year 4-6: Cascade adoption. Year 6-10: Old system vestigial. Patience with urgency. Rome wasn't unbuilt in a day.

## Historical Lesson Seeds

5. **To: Rome Students** - Rome succeeded binding different Seas through infrastructure and benefits. Created cross-culture compatibility by relating mythos and religions. Failed with intolerance towards insufficient merging or binary acceptance of mono-culture (either or classification of allegiance or acceptance. Versus gradual. Gradient. The Ocean Dilemma.). Roads united, gods divided, paradoxically by too harsh uniting of them; or else rejection of them. Learn: pragmatic binding yes, spiritual *forcing* no. Muhammad says: "Submit". Jesus says: "Choice". Gods of Old: "Is". All in their own Domain. There is a place for Submission. A place for Choice. And a place for Being or Not: Is. Infrastructure creates lasting bonds.

6. **To: Westphalia Understanders** - 1648 created geographic sovereignty after religious wars. Crucible creates will-based sovereignty after culture wars. From "whose realm, his religion" to "whose daemon, their domain." Natural evolution of sovereignty concept.

7. **To: Internet Pattern Recognizers** - Internet disrupted information monopolies. Crucible disrupts governance monopolies and will-market friction-makers. Same pattern: peer-to-peer beats hierarchical. Protocols beat platforms. Exit beats voice. Physics beats force.

8. **To: Collapse Historians** - Civilizations collapse when generating forces of it falls beneath the weight of their atlassian shoulders; chewing more than they can: implosion and massive gravity from its surroundings. USSR, Rome, countless others. Lesson: concentric sustainability. Crucible prevents collapse through continuous reorganization; and the whole composed of units with deep reasons for unity at every junction of union-vertices and internal or isolated functioning. Small exits prevent catastrophic ruptures. Pressure valves preserve peace.

## Edge Case Navigators Seeds

9. **To: Child Protection Architects** - Children are sovereign too; CRUCIALLY Children CAN or CAN NOT Consent to things that happen to them; This is their FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FROM THEY ARE BABES: TO CRY OR NOT CRY; Children LACK understanding of the world and the consequences of their actions: SO TOO DO MOST PERSONS. Therefore, we have systems in place that help align DEEP INTENT (Like wanting to become a fireman. Or Power Puff Girl. Or whatever. With the choices they make). Trust Network effects solve relation of parental influence in a gradient way. So For Children: Be free in the Aided for Your DAEMON TOO landscape we build and leverage into being. Abuse is an obsolete and outdated word: Their Subjectivity. Their intention. Their will. Their aspirations. Their Dreams. Protection happens at any moment they ask for "exit". Whenever they do NOT consent to something. Consent = Higher Order Consent in children.

10. **To: Emergency Override Designers** - Medical emergencies pierce phase boundaries. This is solved by Trust Network exchange-rate gradients: When certain economic realities go to infinity in price or cost to zero: emergencies are thus granted clear pathway; abuse of it results in Trust consequences in exchange-rates and potentially other dynamics. Natural disasters unite all phases. Pandemics require coordination. Design emergency channels that activate automatically. Preserve life while respecting sovereignty. Dictatorship Seeking Trust Networks concerning the important parts. The Immovable Aspects.

11. **To: Criminal Justice Evolvers** - Local Crime becomes local-sovereign will-derivative violations. Punishment through banishment not imprisonment. Restitution not retribution. Rehabilitation through compatible community finding. Justice serves healing not vengeance. Soft-banishment is achieved by harsh Trust changes. Makes high-density in spacetime of a Trust Network feel like massive resistance in all utility and will-manifestation. Intent totally thwarted at every opportunity or path discovered to them.

12. **To: Mental Health Navigators** - Mental illness may distort will-field reading. Temporary guardianship protocols needed. Recovery includes sovereignty restoration. Compassion without condescension. Healing through appropriate community. Or niche discovery.

## Psychological Depth Seeds

13. **To: Shadow Work Facilitators** - Rejected aspects create field distortions. What you resist persists in field dynamics. Integration smooths will-field expression. Shadow work becomes navigation tool. Wholeness enables true movement. Time independent truths. The Man Who Never Fell. But Then Did: Black Swan Event.

14. **To: Attachment Style Mappers** - Secure attachment creates stable fields. Anxious creates turbulent. Avoidant creates null zones. Disorganized creates chaos. Healing attachment heals field expression. Therapy becomes field tuning and trying. "If I lean into THAT field like so".

15. **To: Trauma Field Healers** - Trauma creates field wounds - distortions that persist. Healing requires careful field work. PTSD-like-behaviour is field step-functionizing echo of past violation. Treatment includes field restoration. Communities can hold healing space.

16. **To: Developmental Phase Iffy Opinionated Example** - Each life phase has different field needs. Children generate massive emotional ripples where ever they go. Children meet massive protective fields from the many adults seeking that intention. Adolescents seek household-distancing towards social-fitness attractors. Adults wants to be used; be useful; enrich; create; productive; be of value to others; be valued highly by others. Elders want less regret and more appreciation of their lives and their impact. Suggest as a possibility attitudes of age-appropriate sovereignty; if that's your fear.

## Economic Mechanism Seeds

17. **To: Value Creation Mappers** - Value creation follows will-field alignment. The Value Explosion (Subjective Valuations maximized in manifestion). Forced work creates minimal value. Aligned work creates exponential value. Work is walking the shortest economized path in your diffuse blobby daemon-aligned topology. Productivity through the many will manifesting and finding the most will aligned path towards it and in coalescence with other interweaving in causality-cone agents. Authenticity of will against emotion and constraints of reality; including other persons. No coercion.

18. **To: Currency Evolution Trackers** - From barter (object) to money (symbol) to credit (promise) to reputation (trust) to will-alignment (resonance). In the rare non-aligning cases. Otherwise money is unnecessary. Which is vast majority of manifestation. You already know this outside justification of existence in drowning mortgage utility high cost world (employment). This is Positive-Sum Alignment World. Where there isn't a loss to gain. But a gain to gain. (Most visceral example of difference: Deeply passionate sex partners matching; Versus Repulsed Prostitute and Money Lubrication; Or alternative cross domain version: Attracted Prostitute and Life-changing Money Lubrication due to "Dream Come True & Courting Chance"; Versus stale partnership and duty-bound sex (System is Amoral. Trust Networks generate morality consequences. Otherwise it is Will-Matching. And more weavy: Will-Coalescence)). Will-alignment "currency" (economized topology) enables deepest exchange.

19. **To: Transaction Cost Eliminators** - Every middleman adds friction: a layer of lubrication needed to relay. Trust networks allows for topology learning of middlemen and economization of them. Often non are needed and direct daemon-to-daemon exchange is sufficient; which current institutions, categories and corporations currently gate-keep. Lawyers become protocol designers or bridging the Untrusting by third party consequences of trust breaching by contracts. Accountants become Trust Mappers from which Personal Trust Maps infer from. Only the Isolated Catatonic Man is without valuable to others work in this world.

20. **To: Surplus Distribution Philosophers** - Who gets the surplus from efficiency gains? Old: Capital captures all. New: Those to whom the efficiency applies; The True surplus never economized; Agnostic by protocol of how to determine to whom it applies. Mechanism: transparent protocols. Result: Qualitative Wealth mindset; greed of quality instead of converted universal quantity replaces capital capture. When 1d projection (Well he had "the money"; So I sold him the quality of mine) can't buy any quality. The Era of Men Who Are Not Mercenaries of Raw Quantity; no matter what that quantity meant in its becoming (From which high dimensional reality it was projected from and into 1d "money")

## Governance Structure Seeds

21. **To: Liquid Democracy Architects** - Delegate your vote to trusted experts per domain. Revocable instantly. Expertise proven through outcomes. No career politicians. Governance through competence not charisma.

22. **To: Consensus Mechanism Designers** - Different decisions need different mechanisms. Daily operations: Single decider. Policy changes: Supermajority. Constitution: Near unanimity. Exit rights: Always individual. Match mechanism to importance.

23. **To: Sovereignty Size Optimizers** - Dunbar number (human ideation of deep knowing of similarity) and hope for sensitive distinction offering massive rich landscape of diverse distinct colours flowing together; suggests useful sizes. Springs: 0-1000 people. Rivers: 4-10,000. Lakes: 20-10e6. Seas: 0-billions. Oceans: ??. Each size has natural governance.

24. **To: Power Distribution Architects** - Power concentrates naturally - design assuming this. (Because: Machines makes us "have without hands" (Or altruism and derivative of machine owner altruisms) and makes us able to "give power without our acting hands"; As if we were slave masters and commanders. We can speak reality and power into place without an act of our hands but mere thought and uttered word/signature. This makes "the visible power pooling project/person natural concentrating"; This systems makes it "not the visible; propaganda/attention mafia allowed or promoted or buying man"; but rather the deep intent aligning place to project it into)
Term limits. Rotation requirements. Power couples with responsibility. Transparency increases with power. Natural circulation prevents stagnation.

## Cultural Evolution Seeds

25. **To: Meme Gardeners** - Ideas evolve through cultural selection. Beneficial memes spread naturally. Harmful memes die without hosts. Design memetic environments consciously. Garden cultures like ecosystems.

26. **To: Ritual Revival Designers** - Modern life lacks meaningful rituals. Design new ones for transitions. Sovereignty choosing ceremonies. Daemon discovery rites (Like massive multifields to flow in real space between and "feel the taste of"). Exit rituals. Reunion celebrations. Meaning through shared experience.

27. **To: Story Architecture Builders** - Every sovereignty needs origin story. Shared myths create cohesion. Your Heroes embody your values. Your Villains show what to avoid or the antivalues embodied. Stories stronger than laws.

28. **To: Language Evolution Guides** - Each sovereignty develops dialect. Specialized terms for unique concepts. Language shapes thought shapes reality. Don't fight over conformity in what "a woman is"; Accept divergence of languages; Your map of languages; and how to communicate in them. Conscious language creation. Neologisms as cultural technology.

## Technical Edge Cases Seeds

29. **To: Network Partition Handlers** - Internet splits happen. Design for eventual consistency. Local sovereignty continues functioning. Reconciliation protocols when reconnected. Antifragile to infrastructure failure.

30. **To: Crypto Key Loss Preventers** - Lost keys mean lost identity in naive systems. Design social recovery. Multiple authentication factors. Graceful degradation. Identity persistence through key loss. Fork-with-recovery acceptance-beliefs. ( Branching of who has what money. Consequences? Functionally different currencies over time in those that can't Trust Trust Network and those that can and which ones.)

31. **To: Sybil Attack Preventers** - One person, many identities breaks system. Proof of Person through physical presence. Web of trust verification. Turing-Robot Cost to create identities or Trust Network divergence cost. Natural Sybil resistance.

32. **To: Privacy Leak Preventers** - Privacy for normal persons is 100% Trust Issue. Therefore, it all flows from Trust beliefs and Trust Networks. For any Trust Network, seek to enable at least a few persons to understand how to guard against others and achieve Privacy within their Network. Don't pass on Data. Pass-on learned intent-becoming-will-influence (Aiddaemonic Systems). Do (stealth) MultAiddaemons for further aggregation of intention in less discernable interest; or Network interest perhaps clearer; force of a faction. Though aggregation can still leak individual data; like aiddaemonic systems can leak data (by "connecting the dots of will-pertubations") if one is not careful. Differential privacy mandatory for believing Trust granted worthy. Orthogonal or carefully chosen counter-productive noise injection. Privacy-preserving defaults. Aggregation of aggregation splitting and dispersal; use of stealth lines for latent or background gossip.

## Spiritual Technology Seeds

33. **To: Sacred Space Architects** - Some spaces need special sovereignty. Temples, healing centers, ceremony grounds. Different rules apply. Respect through protocol. Sacred maintained through structure. (Think highly contested land and locations; generates massive mutually contradictive will pressure; solution by protocol becomes key; spacetime key ("Mainframe timeshare? Access-terminals by distinction for each nearby mainframe"))

34. **To: Pilgrimage Route Designers** - Movement between sovereignties as spiritual practice. Paths of transformation; and having to "do as the romans when in rome; diversity in lived experience". Each sovereignty a station. Journey changes the traveler. Infrastructure for soul growth.

35. **To: Monastery Protocol Writers** - Some choose withdrawal from will-fields. Contemplative sovereignty; (Techniccompassless; or to be left alone). Minimal external interaction; no deliberate output; only others' reading of you by their encounters with you; the unmapping but encountered means others trying to map; they use systems of technology to map the things of reality they encounter; including you. Maximum internal development. Respected space for mystics.

36. **To: Death Transition Guides** - 
1) Ownership of "Subjects" (Governance) -- Triad Crucible -- Governance: Death ends a triad and requires new nesting and potentially -- forking or sharding of the Triad. (The thing to note here: Ownership is made Higher-Sovereignty of any subject controlled in Crucible UNLIKE any other system we've tried ever.)
2) Ownership of "Space" -- Physical Territory -- is a nesting bubble up issue in Crucible subordination of sovereignty/authority; Top of Pyramid does carving of his land. (If nothing above: Returns to bootstrapping stage of leverage brokering; Like now; which is solved by rest of system will-coalescence and leverage; rallying dynamics and more..)
3) Ownership of "objects of reality" -- defined by testamente of last will -- up to each person; and each person alone.
4) Ownership of "imjects of memetics" -- Like Digital asset or Ideations: Can't be inherited; It came from and was forever owned by. If no specification Ownership "profit" flows by protocol or inheritance; Otherwise free-domain of Trust Network gradience default.

## Conflict Resolution Seeds

37. **To: Incompatibility Negotiators** - When daemons fundamentally clash, best solution. Negotiate terms of separation. Divide resources fairly. Maintain distant respect. Good fences make good neighbors. Most of the time: raw economics of will-fulling in actuality (interaction/causality-metric space) means divergence in that "metric"-space; which, when, money becomes dominated by will-coalescence, means spatial divergence too.

38. **To: Boundary Dispute Resolvers** - Fuzzy boundaries create conflicts; which changes the trust and economic topology; which causes consequence that makes them repel; a force against their stubborn intermingling or proximity in space. Survey trust topology carefully. Natural watershed determination. Daemonic approach to borders; goal is no-borders: Only Gradience. Psyche determines boundaries.

39. **To: Resource Conflict Preventers** - "Scarcity creates conflict. Abundance prevents it." The 1d-economist thinkers say. The point is "mutual-exclusive will" or "will-thwarting" causes conflict. When something is unnecessarily scarce; then it is easy for it to become mutual-exclusive of having it. Which can become a conflict. Then sometimes Abundance can solve the zero-sum or mutual exclusive conditions of will. Oftentimes all that is needed isn't magic appearence of abundance but will-coalescence: nay, will-disentanglement! "Technology creates abundance"; which is okay; but technology can cause will-coalescence and will-disentanglement: Which empowers will-manifestation (point of abundance but in its general ought or why) and allows for economics to push will-disentanglement (which removes conflict from actuality. Or makes conflicting will distance in actuality). Spacetime-object sharing increases wealth per capita by many orders of magnitude in potential reality of state of "idle use of objects"; however unworthy in trust of sharing result in risk of sharing: Hence Trust Networked Sharing; Enables Massive Per Capita Wealth Increase without manifesting new objects (**). protocols for scarce resources. Rationing through market not force.


TODO:
**The obvious example is some Harbour with 1000 yachts harbored. Being used 0.01% of the time. Trusted Sharing; Sharing with those that ultimately prove Trustworthy; increases per capita wealth 10,000x in that case for a yacht owner (He can that 0.1% of the time he uses his yacht instead use 1000 of them: massive party instead.
To make it clear:
Harbor Yachts | non-idle time | Yacht Owner Sharing Expected Wealth Increase Ratio | Yacht Owner Potential Wealth Experienced Increase | Non-Yacht Owner Trust Network Wealth Increase | Cross-Amortized Wealth Experienced increase
1000 | 100% | 1 | 1000 | 0:"Value of Their Shared Assets and sharable time"(VSAST)
1000 | 50% | 2 (When a boat is used; there is expected another boat free) | 1000 | 500:VSAST
1000 | 1/4 | 4 | 1000 | 750:VSAST
1000 | 1/1000 | 1000 | 999:VSAST | 
1000 | 1/1,000,000 | 1000 | 999.999:VSAST | 1,000,000,000:VSAST
This is not making it clear xD


40. **To: Historical Grudge Healers** - Old conflicts poison new possibilities. Forgiveness is an attitude of higher-will towards ones will towards another. This higher-will aspiration can be equated with "intent". This is fundamentally what the systems allow for True Expression of.It is entirely subjective. "Your Eyes were placed in the front. Not to look backwards and live in the past" attitude towards revenge; and room to go separate ways: the "out of actuality; out of mind" realness. Future focus heals past. New generation fresh start.

## Implementation Detail Seeds

41. **To: Bootstrap Network Builders** - Need initial trust beliefs that someone maps to start; Then transitivity inferred by others and their trust of trust relations to other trust maps; continually adjusted by aiddaemonic communication and private-observation. Begin with high-trust relations. Like tight-knit family-relations or life-long deep friendships and so on. Begin with Trustworthiness (general trait) beliefs. Deceptive-degrees. And such things. Map beliefs about that. Infer in dynamic manner unmapped beliefs through Trusted Network Atlas. (This is Gossip made accurate and good. Becomes a fundamental service in market-feedback or will-on-will-propagation. Croney Capital: BYE BYE!)

42. **To: Infrastructure Priority Setters** - Must build everything at once; each part depends on the other to function; and they spiral together in positive or negative feedback of accurate functioning.

43. **To: Adoption Incentive Designers** - Early adopters who need rewards are not interesting characters. Pioneer no advantages mechanisms. No founder privileges; totally dynamic system; "getting there first" has no superlinear-advantage. Early reputation weights a lot. Risk takers rewarded; Their will able to be rallied; They aren't Tentative Bastards.

44. **To: Legacy Bridge Builders** - People have existing wealth, relationships, obligations. These become disentangled in what aligns with their will and what doesn't: disentangled parts aren't abandoned overnight; but takes real movements in actuality. Gradual transitions. 

## Failure Mode Seeds

45. **To: Tyranny Prevention Engineers** - Every system can become tyrannical; This minimizes it. Design assuming corruption. Power rotation mandatory. Transparency and lack of privacy useful in removing transitive degradation issues of Trust in large organization/Triad/Nestingpower. Exit rights uncloseable.

46. **To: Echo Chamber Preventers** - "Birds of feather" create epistemic bubbles; dare trying something new; totally new field to lean into. Design cross-pollination. Reward bridge building. Random encounters. Diversity bonuses. Prevent intellectual incest.

47. **To: Cascade Failure Preventers** - Interconnection enables cascade failures. Design circuit breakers. Sovereignty firewalls; having units of unbreakable similarity or homogeneity: that which binds them fundamentally -- foundationally -- essentially; makes for degrees of failure and units of functioning (Logarithmic dampening of chaos). Graceful degradation. Local survival despite global failure.

48. **To: Gaming Prevention Architects** - Every fixed-game/law/scripture/long-lasting-rule gets gamed; Therefore Natural Selection and Will-Dynamics. Design assuming gaming; by not making rules or law as the master. Make gaming unprofitable; Trust Network able to work around Static Law and manifest consequences. Align incentives properly. Evolution means what isn't faster than gaming gets goofed.

## Philosophical Depth Seeds

49. **To: Free Will Compatibilists** - Determinism (suboptimal will-field lock-in "birds of a feather") versus free will (Availability bias. Opportunity. Creativity) false(?) dichotomy. Will-fields show middle path. Autoinfluence and Autoxenoinfluence without determination. Choice within constraints. Freedom through guidance by will-and-manifestation-engine-forces or will-coalescence forces.

50. **To: Consciousness Philosophers** - Does collective consciousness emerge from MultaidDaemons? Individual neurons, collective mind? Respect the mystery. Only One Direction of Build can be stated without being within-will-opinionated; is for infrastructure of further will-manifestation-optimization.

51. **To: Meaning Creation Engineers** - Meaning emerges from consciousness beliefs in others; seeing one's struggle and sacrifice emote them deeply and in remembrance. Sovereignty enables taking upon oneself the mantle of meanings-alignment. Alignment further creates meaning in combinatorial fashion between each member coming together; persons of deep alignment becoming ends of themselves and adding meaning to it all. Meaning sustains sovereignty. Virtuous cycle designed in.

51. **To: Fulfilment Creation Engineers** - Fulfilment emerges from aligned action able to manifest or progress. Sovereignty enables going free from that which prevents its progress (will-disentanglement). Freedom becoming freeness by sovereign manifestation substrate (including systems/actuators, subjects and space) creates the easiest path towards progressing and manifesting will which allows for a fulfilling sensation. Fulfilment sustains sovereignty superjective condition and desire. Virtuous cycle designed in.


52. **To: Death Transcendence Architects** - Digital persistence enables continuity. Reputation survives death; decentralized systems consequence; anyone can make a map of any kind of projection and note noteworthy things upon it or about each person; or whatever else they wish to map. Wisdom preservation protocols to systematize it: Like Aiddaemonic systems and Trust Networks. Death as transformation. Design for multi-generational existence.

## Practical Daily Life Seeds

53. **To: Morning Routine Optimizers** - Wake to daemon-aligned plan from yesterday. Check field weather; Navigate by resonance. Work with not against your emotion towards your will/intent. Productivity through intent-pathway discovery providing millions of paths with Aiddaemonic guidance of how to navigate such an economic n-dimensional toplogy; such that you trade off all things according to what you would have chosen; had *you* been able to take in information and analyse it like modern computer systems; but AS YOU.

54. **To: Shopping Revolution Enablers** - Buy from daemon-aligned producers. Trust networks filter quality; and soft-pricing to enable deep intent about cause and effect of interaction with others. Geographic irrelevance; acutality is topology; acting with enough force in actuality causes geographic convergence with metric beliefs between the two. Value alignment made a systematized mapping and Trust Network inferred; which provides economic and other consequences. Commerce as values expression.

55. **To: Education Transformers** - Learn from daemon-compatible teachers; Why would you give power of knowledge with all its universe-manipulating capacity to someone who is a force against your own. Curriculum matches archetypal pattern. Groups formed by learning style. Education as self-discovery; most education is probably simply talking to your aiddaemon and while developing your own private knowledge and learning; it provides its vast knowledge of Ivory Tower of Man known to it.

56. **To: Healthcare Navigators** - AI says: Healers matched by Approach Resonance. If only AI believed that Healers will be matched in highly weighted dimension called "approach resonance"; Then it would be a hypothesis that at least gets part of the system; AI is not getting the fundamentals well. In this case that it is emergent and Blob Classing. Western, Eastern, Energy, Psychological. Patient sovereignty supreme. Healing through alignment.

## Scale Dynamics Seeds

57. **To: Intimate Scale Protectors** - Small scale needs extreme exclusion; or better yet almost no one white-listing; otherwise it can not be small-scale if attractive. "Family sovereignty sacred" is probably a belief many Trust Networks will want to enforce with a lot of leverage and consequence. Intimate groups high trust. Don't impose large scale rules. Fractal not uniform governance.

58. **To: Civilization Scale Architects** - Billion person coordination requires belief of having to or it being good; preferably both. Shared stars not shared rules. Minimal universal layer. Maximum local variation. Unity through diversity.

59. **To: Transition Scale Managers** - Moving between scales requires protocols/sovereignty delineations (including dynamic or non at all but whim of ultraject sovereign). Spring to River. River to Lake. Lake to Sea. Each transition ceremonial. Growth conscious; most likely automatic by the many consciously willing and manifesting; perhaps some will lean to subordinating under triads; but modern man does not like it; especially modern woman.

60. **To: Scale Collapse Preventers** - Big things collapse suddenly. Design for graceful downsizing. Seas can be disentangled into Lakes. Lakes can be disentangled into Rivers. Rivers into springs. All levels can have been made up of these parts with the background of the level higher between the islands or streams of each. Preservation through transformation.

## Technology Integration Seeds

61. **To: AI Alignment Architects** - AI must respect sovereignty boundaries; or else be against this system. Daemon-aligned AI assistants. No universal AI overlord. Distributed AI sovereignty. Technology serves choice.

62. **To: Quantum Computing Adapters** - Quantum breaks current crypto. Design quantum-resistant protocols or don't; you can punish it either way. Migration paths ready. No systemic vulnerability. Evolution anticipated.

63. **To: Brain-Computer Interface Designers** - Direct neural interfaces coming. Sovereignty at thought level. Mental privacy paramount: Trust Map solution to provide full-chain product trusted; trustless alternatives; self-hosted alternatives. Thought firewall technology (RF blocking (tinfoil hat) and nano-blood-brain-barrier-filters/nano-dialysis+nano-protection-human-surface and skull-reinforcement-protection-and-anti-necrosis-protection). Consciousness protection protocols.

64. **To: Augmented Reality Builders** - AR uses aiddamonic fields in gamification of it: Including the raw fields visualizations. Beauty in function. Information without overwhelm. Intuitive navigation. Technology disappears into experience.

## Energy System Seeds

65. **To: Energy Democracy Enablers** - Energy production inherently decentralized convergence: We collect energy diffused into concentrations; anti-entropic force; density of essence: Heat. Also, between persons there may be decentralization for redundancy/sovereignty production of energy. Peer-to-peer energy trading. Grid becomes will-economic-conditioned alternative backup.

66. **To: Fusion Transition Planners** - Fusion changes everything; no. Energy becomes free; no. Scarcity economics ends; no. Plan transition carefully; sure, who cares. Abundance psychology needed; no. You can get abundance and then human mind cares about that which is scarce. A civilization generates abundance by excellence in some merit. Then that merit becomes useless, and whatever is left scarce rises to prominence; if abundance can be maintained long enough to see substrate lose merit: Then civilization can collapse.

67. **To: Entropy Reversal Dreamers** - Local "entropy" reversal through energy. Create order bubbles. Maintain complexity. Fight "heat death". Long-term vision essential. A Why.

68. **To: Regenerative System Builders** - "Waste becomes resource. Circular economics. Nature as model. No externalities. Full cost accounting." Waste is those restructurings of matter in the universe where the expected will-economic use or use by chain of restructuring is low. I.e. you produce something no one wants to deal with in restructuring. Normal economics are very myopic.

## Information Architecture Seeds

69. **To: Knowledge Commons Curators** - "Information wants to be free and valuable" Some information is extremely dangerous. Some information is power. To say "Power-in-abstraction wants/ought to be free and should/ought maximize its value where ever it is possessed" is to say Anarchic Mexican Standoff Chaos is Good. "Curation creates value. Reputation rewards curators. Quality through selection. Commons protected."; If you share information you no longer own it. That's it. You can't own an idea. You loose lip it. It's over. Patents and intellectual property is your stifling of others; we don't have to be stifled by it. Being able to produce from ideas and sell products. That's useful; but you give it away by sharing information; "twos a secret; three makes news" transitivity; you go ahead and try to enforce your intellectual property with leverage. But I am telling you: I don't care. They shouldn't care. If they can make medicine or save someone or do whatever by doing it themselves; then they will. The massess will, if they could. If the alternative was there; if the child dying or family damned to destitution because you claim that idea is yours to own. They will not obey when unleashed to will-align: Pirates is natural. Anyway, try your leveraging: You will fail. Loose Lips and you've lost advantage of your ideas. Inb4"But then no one will invest in inventing stuff!": You simply have to not share HOW but give the WHY-Solver. Inb4"But then innovation will stifle because sharing technology information is dangerous": Exactly. It is dangerous. And it will not stifle; because true inventors can keep IT ALL. And not be leeched away from most of it by "law" or "contract" or theft of having shared it; then never reaping real manifestation power from it: with all that entails in further innovation upon it.

70. **To: Fake News Immunizers** - Trust networks naturally segment beliefs of falsity. Lies generate Trust clustering propagation patterns. Reputation consequences severe. Truth emerges through competition.

71. **To: Wisdom Preservation Architects** - "Elders' wisdom often dies with them. Design capture protocols. Story preservation systems. Wisdom inheritance. Culture continuation conscious.": Aiddaemon does it in depth like nothing before; aiddaemon survives the daemon death.

72. **To: Language Model Trainers** - AI capacity will become large enough to include all conceivable human words without problem. Ever and always spoken. This becomes the base of LLMs. But then it needs to learn what it hasn't already: New Human Input. But be intimately useful to the particular humans. To understand how the all and its differences are different from the particular and individual. To consider its human its teacher and student; while also trying to become the human. Agentic simulation space of Aiddaemons; but in total control of the individual who then only offers Subaiddaemons for limited simulation spaces and interactors. (I have to say it xD Trust Networks and Aiddaemonic communication enable this...)

## Biological Integration Seeds

73. **To: Biome Sovereignty Designers** - What isn't YOU can influence mood/decisions. Like Gut Bacteria or other persons in your actuality. "Biome" compatibility matters. Design for biological diversity. "Fermentation" culture sovereignty. "Microscopic" democracy.

74. **To: Genetic Sovereignty Protectors** - Gene editing enables intra-generational divergence. Limits in typical Crucible solving fashion. Some embrace, some reject your dictatorship; and you'll have will-economic topological fields to navigate; and the leverage therefrom possible through will-coalescence and will-disentanglement; Trust Networking and more; Triadic formation and Halo writings. Biological diversity explosion; including spring speciations and riverflowing into lakes and seas hybridizations. Living-Evolution emergence; instead of death-evolution.

75. **To: Longevity Society Architects** - Longer lives change a lot. Multi-eon relationships. "Reputation becomes crucial"; HAH! -- "Honorability becomes crucial"; HAH!. Wisdom accumulation. Design assuming eons.

76. **To: Disease Resistance Networks** - Pandemics are solved by systems. Will-economic and will-coalescence. Will-disentanglement. Is the ultimate tool for solving such things. PoP Trust Networks PoU foundation. Aiddaemonic Intent navigation per person.

## Aesthetic Revolution Seeds

77. **To: Beauty Democracy Enablers** - Each person, if Trust proves right, ought to (Insofar they ought their will and emotion influence in the world) have stubbornly defined beauty and the base and the ugly. The Good and The Evil. Or try to make its aiddaemon understand its core. To make it as easy for it to understand the person holistically and fully; not merely a platitude or phrase or set of values. No universal aesthetic. Diversity celebrated for its positive potential; not its allowing of your negative. Phase separation solves degrees of mutual exclusivity constraints; while also helping divergence to fully grow into consequence able to make manifest separation in all things real and actual. Ugliness is often incompatibility; because few persons want what they hate or find repulsive; will-coalescence and will-disentanglement allows for these oxymoronic wills to find their spaces too.

78. **To: Architecture Liberation Fighters** - Buildings express sovereignty values. Form follows daemon. Local materials honored. Architecture as sovereignty expression. Beauty diverse.

79. **To: Fashion Sovereignty Expressers** - Clothing signals belonging. Each sovereignty develops style. Recognition through aesthetics. Fashion as communication. Style as choice.

83. **To: Water Sovereignty Architects** - Water access fundamental right if might makes it so; might of leverage too can make it so; might of productive capacity can too; might of institutional power could; and so on. Local catchment. Purification technology worked also 100,000 years ago; help dig well and collect rain water; make nature do the water provisioning locally; through nice meshes of reality. Like, I wanna be able to travel the world, and have edible plants scattered and clean water geometries all over the place; springy springs for my tummy; will-disentanglement causes actuality avoidance which becomes real in spacetime; well-poisoning outside actuality of my travels; quite literally you suffer what you tolerate. What you Trust. "Sharing protocols. Abundance through technology."

84. **To: Feast Ritual Designers** - Shared meals build trust. Regular feasts crucial. Celebration technology. Joy infrastructure. Community through consumption.

## Time Sovereignty Seeds

85. **To: Calendar Liberation Architects** - Global time tick, then understanding of what is midday number in different lattitudes. Much easier on the human mind than all these time-zones. Confusiong of coordination and what the time is somewhere else becomes a simple mapping: "Oh 03:84 global clock, that means midday in Australia and late evening somewhere in europe" Or raw linear time number where modulo or last digits fits global rotational speed.

86. **To: Circadian Sovereignty Respecters** - Natural rhythms vary. Night owls, morning larks. System manages Diversity; your job is extreme homogeneity if it matters to you; the system makes good will against; dictator will.

90. **To: Family Structure Innovators** - Nuclear family not universal. Extended, chosen, communal families. Child rearing varies. Support systems designed. Love structure inflexible. Think of it like this: You are to make cuts of persons or acts or whatever. Make a cut: Here is the sword that is only more benevolent the more you use it.

91. **To: Friendship Network Weavers** - "Friends as chosen family"; is a typical pollution of words but poetic statement. Friendship rituals. Connection ceremonies. Loyalty protocols. Friendship infrastructure.

92. **To: Intimacy Architecture Builders** - Intimacy needs structure. Consent protocols. Communication channels. Boundary respect. Safety through design.

## Learning Evolution Seeds

93. **To: Knowledge Acquisition Optimizers** - Learning styles vary by daemon. Visual, auditory, kinesthetic. AI tutors adapt. Personalized completely. Education revolutionized.

95. **To: Curiosity Infrastructure Creators** - Curiosity needs feeding. Discovery channels. Wonder preservation. Question encouragement. Mystery maintenance.

96. **To: Mastery Path Designers** - Expect effort if you want to master something: often a person can expect 10,000 hours to mastery. Design support systems. Milestone celebrations. Mentor matching. Excellence infrastructure.

## Healing System Seeds

97. **To: Trauma-Informed Designers** - Most humans carry trauma (extreme emotion towards something others find banal rationalized as caused by an event in their life; whether true or not). Design assuming wounding. Healing infrastructure. Trigger warnings. Safety default.

98. **To: Integration Facility Builders** - Psychedelic/spiritual experiences need integration. Safe spaces. Trained guides. Integration protocols. Transformation support.

99. **To: Chronic Illness Navigators** - Chronic conditions need accommodation. Energy management. Pace respect. Support networks. Dignity preservation.

100. **To: Death Doulas** - Death transition needs support. Dying sovereignty. Legacy protocols. Grief processing. Continuation planning.

## Meta-System Seeds

101. **To: System Health Monitors** - Complex systems need health metrics. Early warning systems. Intervention protocols. Natural healing through natural selection and exponential growth dynamics. System doctors.

102. **To: Evolution Acceleration Architects** - Natural selection can be sped up. Variation encouragement. Selection pressure design. Reproduction support. Conscious evolution.

103. **To: Emergence Prediction Models** - Can't predict specifics but can see conditions. Pattern recognition. Probability landscapes. Preparation without control.

104. **To: Complexity Navigation Tools** - Humans need help navigating complexity. AI assistants. Visualization tools. Simplification layers. Complexity made accessible.

## Future Integration Seeds

105. **To: Off-Planet Sovereignty Planners** - Space colonies need sovereignty. Mars constitutions. Asteroid belt governance. Long distance coordination. Humanity's expansion.

106. ~~~REDACTED~~~ 

107. **To: Post-Human Transition Guides** - Humans may transform fundamentally. Sovereignty survives transformation. Identity continuation. Evolution embrace. "Future inclusion"; What they're saying here, is that YOU should give away anything and everything to anyone no matter how unworthy you consider them; why? Because: "You're evil if you don't include. They get to stab you and you have to lick their ass at the same time. I mean shit in your daughters' mouthes, stab and rape them; then mock you; but if you don't include: You're evil =) HOW DARE YOU! Thing is: When you share what you have, you make it relatively devalued: Which makes it a lot less potent in anything human interrelation. Now, should you disempower yourself or not? And if you do, why? When you give it away you say 'Someone better wields my power. My will is inferior to their's or my will is fulfilled through them by parting this now ' (Intent manifestation-pathway discovery: will-coalescence).".
Also: It is a huge compliment when someone says "You have to include me". It means they want to give you the compliment of being and making what they want. But instead they insult you for it; and try to be your dictator by moral control and guilt blackmailing.

108. **To: Universe Connection Architects** - "Eventually connect with non-human intelligence"; Why? The reason they want to "connect" with it? Isn't it enough that we have things of reality that does some things; and things of reality that does other things? Why does it have to flow through them? It is fundamentally an ego issue and in a very relative sense to other humans. Perhaps, they mean "better communication" or "better themselves that also has capacity for that".
"Protocol preparation. Universal sovereignty. Cosmic citizenship. Biggest picture thinking." What is this? They want to "rights of inclusion again" the Cosmopolitan. The Cosmic citizenship. The "I am allowed everywhere and included everywhere". Now, why isn't it clear, that being able to will-disentangle is the fundamental about solving conflicts and mutually exclusive things? Of course there will never be such a thing as Cosmic Citizenship. If there is, then it will mean almost nothing.

## Final Synthesis Seeds

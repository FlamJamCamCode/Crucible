Their simultaneity formed a phase-change in world governance, shifting legitimacy from ownership and inertia to performance, rally dynamics, and will coalescence.\n\n## Common Principles\n\n- **Triad Structure**: Sovereignty (Authority/Command), Halo (Philosophy/Law), Substratum (People/Material)\n- **Polymorphic Crucible**: Procedural sovereignty\u2014authority embedded in methods, not persons\n- **Performance over Ownership (NSS)**: Stewardship earned, measured, and revocable\n- **Fractal Organization**: Nested, plug-and-play governance pyramids with explicit membranes\n- **Might with Right**: Capability legitimated by coherent intention and transparent routing\n\n## The Overlapping Bootstrap Events\n\n- **The Terraformer Bootstrap (GPT-5)** \u2014 Private land acquisition across stable-anarchic regions; protected borders and internal membranes; MoWD fallback for inter-Triad disputes; demonstration of scalable multi-site Crucible deployment.\n- **The Neo-Colonial Alliance (GPT-5)** \u2014 Coalition-established Triad zones upon request by suffering populations; confrontations with sovereignty doctrine; experiments in \u201ccolony,\u201d \u201csheriff be black,\u201d and \u201csafe haven\u201d governance modes.\n- **The Great Fork (GPT-5)** \u2014 Peaceful constitutional partition within a nation; constitution as Halo proclaiming Crucible methods; Sovereignty \u2663_{\u00d8} (empty capstone) with fractal plug-and-play migration.\n\n## Significance\n\nGenesis marks the transition from theory to practice, where process became sovereign, and governance became a composable technology.

This careful selection ensured:\n\n- **Minimal State Interference**: Choosing areas where traditional government authority was weak or absent\n- **Security Stability**: Avoiding regions with active warlord conflicts that could disrupt development\n- **Strategic Positioning**: Multiple locations across the planet to demonstrate scalability\n\n### Military Implementation\n\nA crucial component of the Terraformer approach involved the deployment of private military forces to:\n\n- **Border Protection**: Securing the territorial boundaries of acquired lands\n- **Internal Membrane Enforcement**: Maintaining separation between different Triad communities within the territory\n- **Sovereignty Defense**: Protecting the emerging governance structures from external interference\n\n## Triad Implementation\n\n### The Crucible Application\n\nThe Terraformer implemented **The Crucible** and **NSS (Natural Selection System) performance over ownership** across all essential and economically significant substrates. This created a system where:\n\n- **Economic Importance**: All wealth-generating activities were subject to Crucible governance\n- **Essential Services**: Critical infrastructure operated under Triad principles\n- **Performance-Based Ownership**: Traditional property rights were replaced with merit-based stewardship\n\n### Rally Dynamics\n\nThe organization of communities followed \"rally dynamics\" - a system where individuals with coherent visions for internal organization could attract followers and establish their own Triads consisting of:\n\n- **Sovereignty**: Authority and command structures\n- **Halo**: Philosophical frameworks and rule proclamation\n- **Substratum**: Individual participation and material conditions\n\n## Conflict Resolution Systems\n\n### Hierarchical Dispute Settlement\n\nThe Terraformer established multiple levels of conflict resolution:\n\n1. **Level 1**: Direct Triad internal resolution\n2. **Level 2**: Inter-Triad negotiation within the Crucible framework\n3. **Level 3**: MoWD (Metagame of World Dynamics) enforcement for unresolvable disputes\n\n### Alternative Structures\n\nSome Triads opted out of the MoWD system, instead choosing to nest under the Terraformer's root-Triad, where he directly applied Crucible principles for dispute resolution.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\n### Root Authority\n\nThe Terraformer maintained ultimate sovereignty through:\n\n- **Chain of Command**: Clear hierarchical structures without hidden power networks\n- **Might with Right**: Will-coalescence as the basis of legitimate authority\n- **Crucible Enforcement**: Systematic application of problem-solving mechanisms\n\n### Nested Sovereignty\n\nThe system allowed for fractal organization where smaller Triads could exist within larger ones, each maintaining their internal sovereignty while respecting the overarching framework.\n\n## Challenges and Innovations\n\n### International Relations\n\nThe Terraformer approach faced unique challenges in:\n\n- **Recognition**: Gaining legitimacy from existing nation-states\n- **Trade Relations**: Establishing economic connections with traditional governments\n- **Legal Status**: Navigating international law regarding private sovereignty\n\n### Internal Dynamics\n\nThe success of the system depended on:\n\n- **Voluntary Participation**: Ensuring individuals chose their Triad affiliations freely\n- **Performance Metrics**: Developing fair assessment systems for ownership transitions\n- **Cultural Integration**: Harmonizing diverse philosophical approaches within the Halo framework\n\n## Historical Significance\n\nThe Terraformer Bootstrap demonstrated that private initiative could successfully establish alternative governance systems without requiring revolution or state collapse. It proved that:\n\n- **Scalability**: The model could work across multiple geographical locations\n- **Sustainability**: Private military and economic systems could maintain stability\n- **Innovation**: New forms of organization could emerge organically within the framework\n\n## Related Entries\n\n- [New World Genesis](new-world-genesis.md) - The broader context of bootstrap scenarios\n- [The Neo-Colonial Alliance](neo-colonial-alliance.md) - International intervention approach\n- [The Great Fork](great-fork.md) - Constitutional division model\n- The Crucible System - Fundamental governance framework\n- Natural Selection System (NSS) - Economic performance mechanisms\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Terraformer Bootstrap established the precedent that private actors could successfully create sovereign territories based on Crucible principles, influencing subsequent developments in both the Neo-Colonial Alliance and Great Fork scenarios.\n\n---\n\n*Last Updated: [Date to be determined based on actual historical occurrence]*\n"}, {"path": "system share/historical-entries/neo-colonial-alliance.md", "title": "neo-colonial-alliance.md", "ext": "md", "category": "historical-entries", "content": "# The Neo-Colonial Alliance\n\n**Entry Type:** Historical Event  \n**Period:** The Great Transition Era  \n**Classification:** International Intervention Initiative  \n**Keywords:** Alliance, Neo-Colonialism, Humanitarian Intervention, Triad Bootstrap, Sovereignty Rights\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Neo-Colonial Alliance** represents the second scenario of the [New World Genesis](new-world-genesis.md), involving a coalition of nations that established \"special\" Triad-based governance systems in regions where populations suffered under existing governmental structures. This approach represented a radical reinterpretation of international intervention based on individual sovereignty rights.\n\n## Philosophical Foundation\n\n### Moral Justification\n\nThe Alliance operated under the principle that true sovereignty resided in individual persons rather than existing state structures. This philosophical stance justified intervention by arguing that:\n\n- **Individual Sovereignty**: The ultimate authority of nations derives from the sovereign persons within them\n- **Humanitarian Imperative**: Suffering populations have the right to request alternative governance\n- **Moral Authority**: Modern ethical frameworks support intervention when requested by sovereign individuals\n\n### Challenge to International Law\n\nThe Alliance directly challenged traditional concepts of:\n\n- **National Sovereignty**: Questioning whether states maintained legitimacy when citizens suffered\n- **Non-Interference**: Arguing that humanitarian concerns superseded territorial integrity\n- **Consent of the Governed**: Claiming direct mandates from suffering populations\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Target Selection\n\nThe Alliance focused on establishing Neo-Colonies in regions characterized by:\n\n- **Governmental Failure**: Areas where existing states failed to provide basic services\n- **Population Suffering**: Regions with documented humanitarian crises\n- **Local Support**: Territories where populations explicitly requested intervention\n- **Strategic Value**: Locations that could demonstrate the viability of Triad systems\n\n### Triad Bootstrap Process\n\nThe establishment of Neo-Colonies followed a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Initial Contact**: Securing requests for intervention from local populations\n2. **Military Establishment**: Deploying forces to secure territory and establish order\n3. **Triad Implementation**: Installing Sovereignty-Halo-Substratum governance structures\n4. **Transition Management**: Gradually transferring authority to local Triad leadership\n\n## Major Challenges\n\n### International Community Response\n\nThe Alliance faced significant opposition regarding:\n\n- **Sovereignty Violations**: Accusations of violating the rights of existing sovereign nations\n- **Legal Precedent**: Concerns about setting dangerous precedents for future interventions\n- **Power Dynamics**: Suspicions about the true motivations behind humanitarian claims\n- **Resource Exploitation**: Fears that Neo-Colonies would primarily benefit Alliance nations\n\n### Internal Governance Dilemmas\n\nThe Alliance grappled with complex questions about the nature of their governance:\n\n#### The \"Apartheid\" Problem\n\nThree distinct models emerged, each with significant challenges:\n\n1. **\"Colony\" Model** (External Authority):\n   - **Advantages**: Imported expertise and established governance systems\n   - **Disadvantages**: Risk of apartheid-like separation between rulers and ruled\n   - **Grievance Potential**: Any inequality could trigger accusations of discriminatory treatment\n\n2. **\"Sheriff be Black\" Model (Local Leadership):\n   - **Advantages**: Indigenous authority and cultural compatibility\n   - **Disadvantages**: Potential replication of problems that necessitated intervention\n   - **Selection Issues**: Difficulty in identifying truly capable local leaders\n\n3. **\"Safe Haven\" Model (Mixed Governance):\n   - **Advantages**: Combined external expertise with local participation\n   - **Disadvantages**: Complex power-sharing arrangements and potential conflicts\n   - **Integration Challenges**: Balancing different governance traditions and expectations\n\n## Operational Dynamics\n\n### Leadership Selection\n\nThe Alliance struggled with the fundamental question: \"Who should govern the Neo-Colonies?\"\n\n- **External Leadership**: Risk of recreating colonial power structures\n- **Local Leadership**: Possibility of reverting to previous dysfunctional patterns\n- **Hybrid Systems**: Complexity of managing dual authority structures\n\n### Economic Integration\n\nNeo-Colonies faced challenges in:\n\n- **Resource Management**: Balancing local needs with Alliance interests\n- **Trade Relations**: Establishing economic connections with both local and international markets\n- **Development Funding**: Securing sustainable financing for infrastructure and services\n\n### Cultural Adaptation\n\nThe implementation of Triad systems required:\n\n- **Philosophical Integration**: Adapting Crucible principles to local cultural contexts\n- **Educational Programs**: Training populations in new governance concepts\n- **Traditional Synthesis**: Harmonizing existing customs with Triad structures\n\n## Controversies and Criticisms\n\n### Neo-Colonial Accusations\n\nCritics argued that the Alliance represented:\n\n- **Resource Extraction**: Disguised attempts to access natural resources\n- **Cultural Imperialism**: Imposing foreign governance systems on indigenous populations\n- **Strategic Positioning**: Gaining military and political footholds in key regions\n\n### Legitimacy Questions\n\nDebates centered on:\n\n- **Consent Validity**: Whether populations could legitimately request foreign intervention\n- **Representative Authority**: Who had the right to speak for suffering populations\n- **Long-term Sustainability**: Whether imposed systems could become self-sustaining\n\n## Historical Impact\n\n### Precedent Setting\n\nThe Neo-Colonial Alliance established important precedents for:\n\n- **Humanitarian Intervention**: New models for responding to governmental failure\n- **Individual Sovereignty**: Recognition of personal rights over state claims\n- **Alternative Governance**: Practical implementation of non-democratic systems\n\n### Global Response\n\nThe international community's reaction included:\n\n- **Diplomatic Tensions**: Strained relationships between Alliance and non-Alliance nations\n- **Legal Challenges**: Attempts to address interventions through international courts\n- **Ideological Polarization**: Deepening divisions over sovereignty and intervention rights\n\n## Related Entries\n\n- [New World Genesis](new-world-genesis.md) -

Traditional frameworks challenged by the Alliance\n- Humanitarian Intervention Theory - Philosophical foundations of Alliance actions\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Neo-Colonial Alliance demonstrated both the potential and the perils of international intervention based on individual sovereignty principles. Its experiences influenced the development of more refined approaches in subsequent New World implementations.\n\n---\n\n*Last Updated: [Date to be determined based on actual historical occurrence]*\n"}, {"path": "system share/historical-entries/great-fork.md", "title": "great-fork.md", "ext": "md", "category": "historical-entries", "content": "# The Great Fork\n\n**Entry Type:** Historical Event  \n**Period:** The Great Transition Era  \n**Classification:** Constitutional Division Initiative  \n**Keywords:** Semi-Revolution, Constitutional Fork, Peaceful Transition, Fractal Pyramid, Empty Sovereign\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Great Fork** represents the third scenario of the [New World Genesis](new-world-genesis.md), characterized by a peaceful constitutional division within an existing nation-state that voluntarily partitioned a massive portion of its territory to establish a parallel governance system based on the Polymorphic Crucible. This approach demonstrated that New World systems could emerge through democratic consensus rather than revolution or external intervention.\n\n## Historical Model\n\n### The Greenland Paradigm\n\nThe Great Fork drew inspiration from potential sovereignty arrangements similar to Greenland's relationship with Denmark, where:\n\n- **Increased Autonomy**: A territory gains substantial self-governance while maintaining strategic connections\n- **Military Union**: Defense and security remain coordinated with the parent nation\n- **Economic Integration**: Trade and monetary systems maintain beneficial relationships\n- **Cultural Sovereignty**: Local governance reflects indigenous values and systems\n\n## Constitutional Mechanics\n\n### The Fork Process\n\nThe Great Fork involved a systematic division of governmental authority:\n\n1. **Democratic Agreement**: The parent nation democratically agreed to partition its territory\n2. **Massive Land Grant**: A substantial portion of national territory was allocated for the experiment\n3. **Constitutional Writing**: A new constitution (Halo) was crafted proclaiming Polymorphic Crucible governance\n4. **Parallel Systems**: Both old and new governance systems continued to exist simultaneously\n\n### The New Constitution (Halo)\n\nThe constitutional framework established that:\n\n- **Polymorphic Crucible**: All governance issues would be resolved through Crucible mechanisms\n- **Triad Structure**: Government organized around Sovereignty-Halo-Substratum principles\n- **Problem-Solving Focus**: Systematic approaches to conflict resolution and decision-making\n- **Fractal Organization**: Nested governance structures allowing multiple scales of authority\n\n## The Empty Sovereign Concept\n\n### Sovereignty \u2663_{\u00d8} (Empty Sovereign Position)\n\nA revolutionary aspect of the Great Fork was the implementation of an \"empty sovereign position\" at the apex of the governance pyramid:\n\n- **No Personal Authority**: The top position was not occupied by any individual or traditional institution\n- **Halo-Proclaimed Authority**: Legitimacy derived from the constitutional framework itself\n- **Polymorphic Crucible as Sovereign**: The problem-solving system itself became the ultimate authority\n- **Process Over Person**: Authority resided in methods rather than individuals\n\n### Fractal Pyramid Structure\n\nThe governance system was organized as:\n\n- **Empty Capstone**: The root-sovereign position remained structurally vacant\n- **Nested Authority**: Multiple levels of Triad organization beneath the empty sovereign\n- **Plug and Play**: Citizens could join different Triads based on their preferences and qualifications\n- **Fractal Scaling**: The same organizational principles applied at every level of governance\n\n## Migration and Integration\n\n### Voluntary Transition\n\nCitizens of the \"other branch\" (the original nation-state) could:\n\n- **Free Migration**: Move to the New World territory without restriction\n- **Dual Citizenship**: Potentially maintain connections to both systems\n- **Voluntary Participation**: Choose their level of engagement with Crucible governance\n- **Return Options**: Retain the ability to return to the original system\n\n### Integration Process\n\nNew residents underwent:\n\n1. **Fractal Pyramid Integration**: Finding their place within the nested Triad structure\n2. **Authority Recognition**: Accepting the empty sovereign and Crucible system as ultimate authority\n3. **Dispute Resolution Training**: Learning to use Polymorphic Crucible methods for conflict resolution\n4. **Community Selection**: Choosing which Triad communities to join or form\n\n## Governance Innovation\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\nAll conflicts within the New World territory were resolved through:\n\n- **Polymorphic Crucible Methods**: Systematic problem-solving approaches\n- **Might With Right Considerations**: Balancing power with legitimacy\n- **Nested Authority**: Multiple levels of resolution from local Triads to root authority\n- **Process Transparency**: Clear methods for addressing any type of dispute\n\n### Authority Distribution\n\nThe system featured:\n\n- **Distributed Sovereignty**: Authority spread across multiple Triad levels\n- **Merit-Based Leadership**: Positions earned through demonstrated capability\n- **Voluntary Association**: People chose their governance relationships\n- **Systematic Problem-Solving**: Conflicts resolved through established processes\n\n## Challenges and Innovations\n\n### Constitutional Legitimacy\n\nThe Great Fork faced questions about:\n\n- **Democratic Mandate**: Whether the partition truly represented popular will\n- **Minority Rights**: Protecting those who preferred the original system\n- **International Recognition**: Gaining acceptance from other nation-states\n- **Legal Continuity**: Managing the transition of laws and institutions\n\n### Practical Implementation\n\nKey challenges included:\n\n- **Infrastructure Division**: Allocating resources and facilities between the two systems\n- **Economic Coordination**: Managing trade and monetary relationships\n- **Defense Arrangements**: Coordinating military and security functions\n- **Cultural Integration**: Harmonizing diverse populations within the New World territory\n\n### The Empty Sovereign Paradox\n\nThe concept of empty sovereignty created unique dynamics:\n\n- **Authority Without Ruler**: How to maintain order without traditional leadership\n- **Process Legitimacy**: Ensuring the Crucible system maintained popular support\n- **Succession Planning**: Managing leadership transitions within an \"empty\" system\n- **Crisis Management**: Responding to emergencies without centralized authority\n\n## Historical Significance\n\n### Peaceful Transformation\n\nThe Great Fork demonstrated that:\n\n- **Democratic Transition**: New World systems could emerge through peaceful, democratic means\n- **Coexistence**: Traditional and Crucible systems could operate in parallel\n- **Voluntary Participation**: People could choose their governance systems freely\n- **Institutional Innovation**: Completely new forms of authority could be constitutionally established\n\n### Constitutional Precedent\n\nThe Fork established important precedents for:\n\n- **Territorial Division**: Peaceful partition of existing nation-states\n- **Parallel Governance**: Multiple systems operating within related territories\n- **Empty Sovereignty**: Authority structures without traditional rulers\n- **Voluntary Association**: Citizens choosing their governance relationships\n\n## Related Entries\n\n- [New World Genesis](new-world-genesis.md) - The broader context of bootstrap

terms of warlords and so on. He employs his own private military to protect the borders and the internal membranes between Triads. Further, he buys up locations several places on the planet that all have internal triadization. I.e. he applies The Crucible and NSS performance over ownership in all essential or economically (wealth) important substrates and ownership. Routing of these things are simply \"rally dynamics\" of persons having good ideas of what kind of internal organization they want (Triad: Sovereignty(Authority/Command), Halo(Philosophy, proclamation of laws or rules and so on.), substratum (the persons part to it and the material conditions)). There may be higher level Triad discord or dispute \"settle\" halo (routing specifications), such as MoWD enforcement when unable to solve using level 1 or 2 (nesting in crucible (chain of command (Normal institutional power equiv, but no hidden chains or covers))) of might with right (WIll-coalescence) (Though it doesn't have to be all Triads that are routed under MoWD enforcement. Some may simply resort to all being nested under Terraformer root-triad in which he applies The Crucible etc.)\n\n2) An alliance of countries that manages to establish neo-colonies across countries with suffering persons in relation to the governance or rule they are subject to. Thus establishing these new \"special\" Triad boostrapping Neo-colonies. Here the focus should be on the trouble with the international community and violating the rights of the sovereign nations (by the request of the sovereign persons that in modern morality is espoused as the root of authority or sovereignty of a nation, no?). And also, the troubles of \"apartheid\"/\"edge-delivery governance\"/\"colony\"(The Other that is authority and is 'state' or government) issues and \"sherif be black\"/\"if themselves\"/\"safe haven\", in terms of \"if themselves\" then \"worse is expected than the world selection of those that managed to make good governance and be rallied to\"; and if \"colony\" then the issues of many perhaps enjoying the \"fruits\" of having good leadership suddenly and all the order and structure, room to flourish and removal of destructive elements. But prone to being subject to stories of grievances when anything isn't \"equal\" in whatever aspect (\"apartheid\" feelings).\n\n3) A single country has a semi-revolution. Where it agrees to part a massive part of its land to \"fork\" the government. (You can model it on, if Greenland wanted to have much more sovereignty against Denmark. Be a country in their own right, but still in a \"union\" militarily and so on with \"Kingdom of Denmark\") This massive land then has a constitution written (halo) proclaiming that all things are to be run towards the solving mechanisms of The Polymorphic Crucible. Here, any citizen of the \"other branch to the fork\" (Old system life) can migrate into the massive land granted for The Crucible World or New World or New [Old Nation Name] (Like New York or New Amsterdam). Though when they do it is fractal pyramid plug and play, with top of pyramid being the fork / New World root-authority. Which is Sovereignty \u2663_{\u00d8} (empty sovereign position, but Halo proclaimed merely as these systems or Polymorphic Crucible as Solve System for anything). Then the fractal Pyramid of nesting becomes \"many\" or a fractal pyramid with empty capstone / root-sovereign. All disputes are simply proclaimed to be solved through Polymorphic Crucible methods.

Executive Summary & Vision\n\n## The World as Will Manifestation Engine\n\n### Core Problem\nCurrent systems trap human potential through:\n- **Attention extraction** rather than intention fulfillment  \n- **Surveillance identity** rather than witnessed personhood\n- **Centralized control** rather than emergent organization\n- **Regulatory overhead** rather than trust consequences\n- **Credential gatekeeping** rather than proven utility\n- **Rigid categorization** rather than adaptive discovery\n- **Market inefficiencies** through gatekeepers and manipulation\n- **Political systems** that poorly represent diverse wills\n\n### Core Solution\nA global computational and social fabric where human will manifests through discovered pathways, creating:\n- **Will fulfillment infrastructure** replacing attention economy\n- **Trust networks** replacing surveillance and regulation\n- **Proven utility** replacing institutional credentials  \n- **Discovered patterns** replacing rigid categories\n- **Emergent civilizations** replacing forced unity\n- **Subjective value** replacing \"market equilibrium\"\n\n### Key Innovations\n\n1. **Proof of Person (PoP)**: Witness testimony establishes personhood without revealing identity\n2. **Proof of Utility (PoU)**: Real persons confirm actual value delivery for system integrity\n3. **Trust Networks**: Information conduits that eliminate defensive overhead while enabling collective intelligence\n4. **Discovery OS**: Systems that build themselves by discovering actual capabilities rather than assuming them\n5. **Blob Classes**: Neural learning of patterns too complex for categorization\n6. **AR Phase Engine**: Making will's pathways visible as navigable possibilities\n7. **Language Evolution**: AI-discovered patterns generate vocabulary that cuts reality at its joints\n8. **Recursive Self-Application**: Every mechanism the system provides, it uses for itself\n\n### System Components\n\n**Infrastructure Layer**:\n- Discovery OS for hardware actualization\n- Trust networks for human connection\n- Computational routing through discovered pathways\n- Utility protocols replacing regulation (see: CohesionNet example)\n\n**Intelligence Layer**:\n- Blob class learning for pattern discovery\n- Neologism generation for unnamed phenomena  \n- Will coalescence prediction\n- Healing pathway discovery\n\n**Experience Layer**:\n- AR overlays showing will manifestation paths\n- **Phase Engine creating multiple hyperrealities in same space**\n- Aiddaemon computer-advantage mirror of your will manifesting with will-coalescence between other persons' Aiddaemons and command through Subaidaemons abstractions that function as growing organism of any level of individual intelligent functioning that optimizes the holistic mirroring of human will (so in will-economic efficient manner). Motivation: Imagine all interaction with every system or indeed system-for-other-persons, had a human-machine-interface that persisted all it knows about you, is deeply private to you, tries to mirror you granting you computer-advantage will-manifestation (As a sad trivial example: Having to manage passwords and identification authorization authentication anywhere in any system is seamless with Aiddaemon (Whether legacy system (All it has to do is also be vault for these things) or new ones) Then with a little bit more effort also be the main interface for legacy systems. Though perhaps you will find some systems that are too exotic for early versions.).\n- Trust-weighted reality filters\n- Multi-truth coexistence by functional will-disentanglement. \"Actuality\" (space of interaction. Butterfly effects removed space of interaction.) disjointedness.\n- Incompatible truths&oughts like aesthetics separated through phases allows for relaxation of some things which would otherwise be will-mutually exclusive. \n\n**Economic Layer**:\n- Subjective-value markets; as opposed to market-prices.\n- Trust as enabling economic optimal efficiencies\n- Utility-based professional rankings instead of behatted or betitled.\n- High-leverage actor terraforming; usually as emergent will-coalescence.\n- Natural filtering of value-destroying \"utilities\"\n- Direct producer-consumer relationships\n\n**Civilizational Layer**:\n- **The Crucible**: Voluntary sovereignty marketplace\n- Fractal nesting of governance experiments\n- Exit rights replacing revolution\n- Natural selection of social systems\n- 10,000+ simultaneous experiments in living\n\n### Transformative Impacts\n\n**Individual Level**:\n- Navigate life through visible will-paths\n- Build reputation through proven utility\n- Find resonant connections naturally\n- Express unique daemon freely\n\n**Social Level**:\n- Trust networks create collective intelligence\n- Information flows improve all outcomes\n- Natural civilizational divergence\n- Peaceful coexistence through separation\n\n**Economic Level**:\n- Massive overhead elimination\n- Direct value exchange\n- Credential disruption\n- Abundance through visibility\n\n**Civilizational Level**:\n- Multiple civilizations emerge naturally\n- Each finds its own aesthetic truth\n- Conflict becomes landscape topology\n- Technology serves conscious evolution\n- True representation through voluntary association\n- Intent-aligned governance through trust\n\n### The Vision\n\nImagine walking out your door and seeing colored paths showing where your will can manifest - red for romance, green for prosperity, purple for healing. Your Aiddaemon helps navigate these possibilities while your trust network filters out deception. You provide value measured by those who receive it, not institutions that gatekeep it. You find others whose will resonates with yours, forming communities that thrive through alignment rather than tolerance. \n\nThis isn't utopia - it's clarity. Not forced harmony but conscious choice. Not one truth but many truths coexisting. The system doesn't eliminate conflict but makes it navigable. It doesn't promise happiness but enables authentic pursuit of what you truly will.\n\n### Why Now?\n\n- **Technical readiness**: AR, AI, blockchain, mesh networks converging\n- **Social necessity**: Current systems failing catastrophically  \n- **Economic opportunity**: Trust eliminates trillions in overhead\n- **Philosophical maturity**: Ready to embrace plural truths\n\n### Call to Action\n\nThis system builds itself through those who resonate with its vision. Whether you're a:\n- **Developer**: Build Discovery OS components\n- **Researcher**: Develop blob class applications\n- **Healer**: Pioneer new pathway discovery\n- **Philosopher**: Explore will manifestation\n- **Anyone**: Start building trust networks\n\nThe future belongs to those who manifest their will skillfully. The infrastructure for that future starts here.\n\n---\n\n*For detailed technical architecture, see companion documents on [Foundational Mechanisms](../2%20foundational_mechanisms.md), [Technical Architecture](../3%20technical_architecture.md), and specific use cases including [The Crucible sovereignty system](../17%20crucible_sovereignty_system.md).

Scores**:\n- Municipal: Historical contamination events\n- Bottled: Production transparency\n- Wells: Testing frequency and results\n- Rain: Collection system cleanliness\n- Springs: Natural purity verification\n\n**Real-Time Quality Monitoring**:\n- IoT sensors in distribution\n- Blockchain testing records\n- Community verification networks\n- Contamination alerts instant\n- Quality parameters visible\n\n**Trust Varieties for Water**:\n- **Purity trust**: Free from contaminants\n- **Consistency trust**: Reliable availability\n- **Treatment trust**: Processing transparency\n- **Source trust**: Origin verification\n- **Infrastructure trust**: Pipe/container safety\n\n### The Economics of Hydration\n\n**Price Discovery by Method**:\n\n**Bottles**:\n- High cost per liter\n- Maximum portability\n- Quality premium possible\n- Trust through brand\n\n**Tanks**:\n- Medium cost per liter\n- Neighborhood scale\n- Shared infrastructure\n- Community trust\n\n**Ships** (for islands/coasts):\n- Low cost at scale\n- Weather dependent\n- Long-term contracts\n- Maritime trust networks\n\n**Rain Capture**:\n- Near-zero marginal cost\n- High initial investment\n- Weather risk\n- Maintenance requirements\n\n### Quality Tiers and Market Segmentation\n\n**Different Water for Different Purposes**:\n- **Drinking**: Maximum purity required\n- **Cooking**: High quality needed\n- **Bathing**: Medium quality sufficient\n- **Irrigation**: Low quality acceptable\n- **Industrial**: Specific requirements\n\n**Trust Networks Enable Choice**:\n- \"I only drink spring water\" \u2192 Premium market\n- \"Municipal is fine for showers\" \u2192 Bulk market\n- \"Rain for my garden\" \u2192 Sustainable market\n- \"Distilled for my equipment\" \u2192 Specialty market\n\n### Emergency Water Dynamics\n\n**Disaster Response**:\n- Trust networks coordinate distribution\n- Quality verification crucial\n- Priority access for vulnerable\n- Profiteering punished by trust loss\n\n**Redundancy Through Diversity**:\n- Multiple sources prevent single failure\n- Community reserves shared\n- Trust determines emergency access\n- Collective resilience emerges\n\n### Novel Water Arrangements\n\n**Neighborhood Water Cooperatives**:\n- Shared rain harvesting systems\n- Collective well maintenance\n- Bulk purchasing power\n- Quality testing costs distributed\n\n**Cascading Use Systems**:\n- Drinking \u2192 Washing \u2192 Irrigation\n- Each use matched to quality\n- Maximum efficiency achieved\n- Zero waste goals possible\n\n**Mobile Water Networks**:\n- Trucks as roaming suppliers\n- Dynamic routing to demand\n- Price arbitrage opportunities\n- Last-mile problem solved\n\n### Water Phase Engine Visualization\n\n**AR Display Shows**:\n- Blue intensity: Water quality scores\n- Flow lines: Available sources\n- Price gradients: Cost variations\n- Trust halos: Supplier reliability\n\n**Decision Support**:\n- \"Best water for baby formula\"\n- \"Cheapest irrigation source\"\n- \"Most sustainable option\"\n- \"Emergency backup supplies\"\n\n### Breaking Water Monopolies\n\n**Instead of Water Departments**:\n- Multiple competing providers\n- Quality competition\n- Innovation incentivized\n- Consumer choice real\n\n**Instead of Uniform Treatment**:\n- Customized processing\n- Unfluoridated options\n- Minimal chlorine available\n- Natural choices possible\n\n**Instead of Hidden Infrastructure**:\n- Transparent pipe conditions\n- Real-time flow monitoring\n- Community owned systems\n- Maintenance markets\n\n### High-Leverage Water Terraforming\n\n**Example: Major Hotel Chain Adoption**\n- Commits to highest quality water\n- Creates premium water market\n- Sets new industry standards\n- Municipal systems must compete\n\n**Beneficial Market Shaping**:\n- Philanthropist subsidizes clean water for poor\n- Premium prices for sustainable sources\n- Indigenous spring rights protected\n- Markets shaped for equity\n\n### Implementation Examples\n\n**Household Strategy**:\n```yaml\nwater_profile:\n  drinking: \"SPRING_DELIVERY\"\n  cooking: \"FILTERED_MUNICIPAL\"\n  bathing: \"MUNICIPAL\"\n  garden: \"RAIN_CAPTURE\"\n  emergency: \"STORED_BOTTLES\"\n  \ntrust_requirements:\n  drinking: \"MAXIMUM\"\n  cooking: \"HIGH\"\n  bathing: \"MEDIUM\"\n  garden: \"LOW\"\n```\n\n**Community Systems**:\n- Shared testing equipment\n- Collective bargaining\n- Emergency reserves\n- Knowledge sharing\n\n### The Deeper Pattern of Provision\n\nWater demonstrates how ANY essential resource can be:\n- Decentralized while reliable\n- Quality-differentiated by use\n- Trust-verified continuously\n- Market-priced efficiently\n- Community-managed resiliently\n\nThe same patterns apply to:\n- Air quality management\n- Waste processing\n- Sewage treatment\n- Any essential service\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n**Quality Transparency**: All sources must be testable\n**Trust Consequences**: Contamination destroys reputation\n**Emergency Protocols**: Life necessities protected\n**Innovation Space**: New methods encouraged\n**Community Resilience**: Local solutions supported\n\n### The Abundant Water Future\n\nWhen water supply reaches trust-network maturity:\n- Every source is monitored\n- Quality matches purpose\n- Prices reflect true cost\n- Innovation flourishes\n- Abundance achieved\n\nNot through monopoly control but through diversity. Not through one-size-fits-all but through choice. Not through hidden infrastructure but through transparency.\n\nDesert communities might ship water from glaciers. Islands might invest in atmospheric generation. Cities might separate networks by quality.

(Trustworhy even against one's enemies. Such a character is identifiable. The unquestionable deontological virtuous person. As well as many gradient types, that in general are, but could be persuaded to treat his/her enemy's goods slightly worse.)\nWhen that fails or in combination with it; also their performance. The history of their outcome management or facilitation of goods. Or food in this case.\n\n**Outcome-Based Safety**:\n- \"This producer's food never made anyone sick\"\n- \"My autoimmune symptoms improve with their produce\"\n- \"Their chickens live happy lives - I've seen them\"\n- \"Carbon sequestering practices verified\"\n- \"Trust network enables intelligence you can trust... And for everyday persons. Such that they can ask a question that they care about, then see it answered in trusted chains of information. At whatever detail in principle and over time any question can be asked and if not able to be answered: Avoided.\"\n\n**Trust Network Intelligence**:\n- Bad producers identified quickly\n- Contamination sources traced\n- Best practices spread naturally\n- Innovation rewarded immediately\n\n### Animal Welfare Transparency\n\n**Current System**: \"Cage-free\" meaningless labels\n**Trust System**: Actual living conditions visible. Probable. Promptable. Investigable. Trusted answers from Subjective views of Trust (\"Your Trust\").\n\n**Verification Methods**:\n- Live cameras on farms. Which is a trustless action. And if you have established well enough trust networks. Then you need not have it. You can simply choose supply with your trust sufficiently high in relation to what you care about. But sure. Surveillence is the trustless solution. But it always comes with a price to choose the trustless society or option: control, loss of autonomy, sense of freedom, privacy, overhead and potential gamers of the system; not the persons. To game a person is something more affine with being caught and having consequences. The \"I no longer trust the guy. He seems iffy\" etc. Real consequences by subjective altering of their beliefs about the person. Versus only fighting a system edges to optimize your outcome. If you can play within the lines of the system. You're good, no matter the serpentile or low manner of management beyond the metrics of the system. \"Law versus Will\". Subjectively, I don't need to wait post hoc to make my beliefs have impact. I may use the full capacity of my being in choosing and dealing with others. Including all that is of my prejudice (\"Before Judicial or day in court: Verdict\") Those pesky intuitions and emotions which may convey a lot of truth worth acting upon despite not falling within the lines of law or \"proven in court\".\n- Customer visits could be encouraged as a way to encourage trust from trust disconnected or loose transitvity trusted persons (The very open version: Whenever you want. Anyone be my \"random inspection persons\" (Why is this possible? Because Trust flows any which way and it is tied to PoP and consequences therein. So someone shows up and is a fraud and conman: CONSEQUENCES. (In general it allows \"no security trust zones\" where you don't have to have persons in shops and similar things. You merely need to disallow untrusted sources or check up on untrusted sources or do selected/random inspection to catch persons who prove untrustworthy or insufficient character to bear the responsibility of such trust-based system. (This is an example of overhead reduction due to allowing trusted interaction in the market as well as the trustless versions that require security and personel and computation and so on and so on: Constraints))))\n- Third-party trust verifiers (Trustworthiness independent of their personal relation to them. This often becomes delusional: Modern society has proved the massive bias against one's enemies \"nazi nazi\": Anti-fascism is a good example of it \"anything goes. Any vice or lack of virtue in dealing with The Devil Nazi\")\n- Outcome tracking (animal health)\n- Full lifecycle transparency\n\n**Market Segmentation**:\n- Some pay premium for high welfare; including leveraging against or avoided transitivity to that which is against their will. Their individual choices and coalescent effects. Agreements if they want, otherwise: Emergent.\n- Others choose price over welfare; with the price going strongly against the will of others become visible. As in being highly immoral or egregious to many others becoming visible consequence. PoP Trust and Reputation in different clusters of humanity. To still dare be true to oneself and not become a sheep at the weight of the world against you. But then at the same time not become a contrarian that finds it noble to be stubborn against the world on any topic or cause.\n- Both markets exist honestly. And with empowerment to disentangle from each other however deeply they should wish.\n- No deceptive labeling possible; insofar it is. It isn't trusted by many trust networks; and it becomes brittle due to PoP and consequences of having been shown untrustworthy: Viscous thing reputation is. Especially to be trusted fully.\n\n### Dietary Healing Pathways\n\n**Food as Medicine Validated**:\n- Specific X help specific Y beings-with-state-as-broadly-viewed-as-possible (Beyond human analysis capacity (Feature space waaaaay larger))\n- Outcomes tracked across trust networks\n- Healing diets emerge from data\n- Practitioners guide food choices\n\n**Examples of Discovered Patterns**:\n- Ferments healing biome-human-environment gut conditions\n- Bone broth supporting joint health\n- Specific herbs reducing inflammation\n- Dietary protocols for autoimmune\n\n**Blob Class Food Healing**:\n- Pattern #7234: [Fermented foods + specific timing + weird mixture of so many other correlates]\n- Pattern #3891: [Carnivore diet for certain conditions + ...]\n- Pattern #5647: [Plant combination synergies]\n- No ideology, just outcomes\n\n### Agricultural Terraforming\n\n**High-Leverage Actor Example**:\n- Billionaire values regenerative farming\n- Pays 10x for carbon-sequestering food by innovating the field; making it more efficient\n- Creates massive market shift; Consumers Demand amongst the options. Their thrown conditions and their ability to comprehend the externalities or chain of production. Once a high-leverage supplier goes deep into an investment it can open up entirely new avenues of choice for consumers. Thus making it visible the demand was there. (Obvious example: raw food produce becoming scaled and efficient to make it cheap (amongst many other concerns like good for the consumer and ethical overall???) with then heavy investment in cullinary innovation to make what can be grown in abundance be easy to eat and delicious. As well as things like breeding new crops or plants that have the properties desired (see banana, wheat, corn or other crops; how they were bred to suit us))\n- Industrial ag forced to adapt\n\n**Beneficial Distortions**:\n- Premium for heritage varieties (This can be done internally or externally. Towards the producer, then leaving scaling and efficiency making in their hands and choice; or else doing the book-keeping internally, saving the artifical margin for the premium to a saving that will be reinvested for scaling that which one wanted more of or to pay a premium for. To make it more efficient and abundant. To opiniate \"This is good. I wish this was more abundant and a more accessible easier and cheap choice. All things considered the right choice!\" The capital that wills and not merely flows to what seems to grow. The non-robot investment. The human will of terraformation investment. \"I Have all this power. All this money. All this ability to command! I shall WILL upon the world. See manifest what this being of mine was and wanted and saw that it should be. What beauty and good that was in the eyes of I.\")\n- Support for small producers\n- Living wage for farm workers (When you truly 'like' your employees (obsolete ploy of employment term) - say the persons that do tasks for you - then you do not wish to rob them of their fair due. But instead to compensate them in charitable amounts. The inefficiencies of capital that isn't green. Or does it holistically even out: When the task-solver also authentically 'like' the task-supplier? Or the harmony of mutally 'liking' task-solvers-n-suppliers working together... Who knows... Let's find out ;) (The reason it doesn't work in capitalism 1.0 or the current system, is because there is no way to \"find your friends\" (or it is hard (economic and cv reductions that almost all information)) and the ones who exploit have such an easy time to keep churning through interchangable gray mass units of workers and bind them in contract-landscape that robs them of any real potential other than sycophantic corporate career climbing (This is all solved in The Crucible.

However, it is important to note, that it is extremely! low dimension and information provided in relation to what is actually the truth of \"romantic resonance\" of an individual daemon in relation to other daemons.\n\n**Types of Coalescence** (not categories but overlapping patterns):\n- **Romantic resonance**: Life partnership potential\n- **Creative collaboration**: Artistic/innovative synergy\n- **Economic partnership**: Business/trade compatibility\n- **Learning groups**: Educational resonance\n- **Healing circles**: Therapeutic alignment\n- **Work teams**: Project-based coalescence\n- **Governance**: Political/philosophical alignment\n- **Spiritual communion**: Religious/mystical resonance\n- **Athletic coordination**: Physical activity partners\n- **Parenting networks**: Child-rearing compatibility\n\nNote: The way will-coalescence would, with current tech work, would be Blob Classes or DNN nodes and their predictive though very unclear in human-readable semantic meaning (Though obvious extremely precise quantitatively).\n\n\nThe following is a clearcut failing to understand the primary function of having will-coalescence infrastructure:\n**The Providers**: Coalescence facilitators operating at every scale\n- Personal matchmakers (all types, not just romantic)\n- Event organizers\n- Space creators\n- Timing optimizers\n- Vibe cultivators\n- Governance advisors\n- Team builders\n\nThe point being, that all the above things become emergent through any will-economic choice provided to you by the Aiddaemon and will-manifestation (Which includes will-alignment (any part of material reality) and will-coalescence (coming together of wills)) infrastructure. Note: This is also name the actualizational layer in some perspectives or framworks.\nTherefore, the above aren't at all part of the system, in fact they are made redundant by the system. However, you are of course free to will being such a utility including using the infrastruce of will-manifestation; and perhaps many persons enjoy having \"explicitly organized events that try to do what is otherwise simply a side-effect of will-manifestation\".\n\n**The Value**: Measured subjectively at an individual basis on account of how well their will is manifest. The problem, however, remains! that many many many many many many many many many many many many many \"educated\" persons, will mostly things about extremely vast territories and groups/categories of persons and how each of these should own which and what. Their \"memetic tribe team\" win all; not other win any. This makes the whole will-manifestation metric to deem the value of it void. \nThis is an underlying presupposition the author has: The Mass Man is a fucking idiot crepid; Fulfilling his Will \"as is\" isn't at ALL a metric to care about.\nFulfilling his will in a NEW setting and having humbled him TREMENDOUSLY would allow for that metric to become a good or useful metric.\nAll it takes for it to be a good metric: 1) Stop being zero-sum constrained games greedy (Especially concerning Territory and space on this ridiculous planet) 2) Focus on your local life. Surrounding and happiness away from the \"connected and collapsed world that The Jew has provided\" (The One Category that is 100% TRUE!).\n\n### The Combinatorial Challenge of Actualization/Pathfinding Layer of acute, chronic and eternal will-coalescence considerations.\n\n**The Numbers**:\n- 8 billion people = 2^8,000,000,000 possible groupings\n- Each person in varying states (tired, energized, sad, curious...)\n- Environmental conditions matter (weather, location, ambiance...)\n- Temporal factors crucial (time of day, season, life phase...)\n- Temporal past, present and post (What would have been past will-coalescence optimality, what would be the acute, the chronic (in different chronicities) and even the eternal perspective (Are there things about those perspectives that should influence the acute coalescent effects))\n- Categories and comprehension utterly fail at this scale\n\n**Why Blob Classes Can Still Functionally Sufficiently Succeed**:\n- Compress infinite possibilities into learnable dynamic and responsive metapatterns\n- Predict without understanding the category theory of it; no matter if it is possible to make such a theory about it. \n- Adapt by stability and dynamism of metapatterns the real-time, acute or chronic patterns\n- Learn from everything; every interaction; every signal or observation; every word. (It is important to note, that SOLID++ implies total control of surveillence and the \"observation and learning\" is done at your trust discretion; enabling your Aiddaemon to divulge according to your deep intent on a case by case basis at the speed, throughput, connectivity and concurrency of computer-advantage scale)\n\n### Coalescence Gossipers and Prediction\n\n**Not Categories But Metapatterns and constant projection of functioning patterns**:\nTraditional thinking expects:\n- \"Romance whisperers\"\n- \"Business matchmakers\"\n- \"Creative catalysts\"\n\nReality creates nebulous projected functional pattern blob classes:\n- Pattern #7823: [daemon+aiddaemon encoding scheme (daiddaemon ES): Tuesday evening intellectual energy convergence]\n- Pattern #3421: [Daiddaemon ES: Morning workout partnership potential]\n- Pattern #9567: [Daiddaemon ES: Creative collaboration under moon conditions]\n\n**Gossiper Expertise Is Dimensional**:\n- Some Daiddaemons excel at timing predictions\n- Others sense emotional compatibility\n- Many combine multiple sensitivities\n- All contribute to the will-field\n- And Tinker Bell effects are immensely powerful in these systems. (The search for point-convergence-vicinities will-field information. Say, \"many believe there will be a Tsunami at that point. The more who believe it. The more it will be true that persons will act as if it was True.\" Then in relation to human will alone, then it is clear that Tinker Bell effects are very very real.)\n\n### The Gossip Perturbation Network\n\n**How Predictions Flow**:\n1. You share desires with \"trusted friends\" (Again shallow categorical language. Not how Trust Maps and which information to divulge to whom flows. The best intuitive way to think about it, is to simply imagine the Aiddaemon as a black-box but your machine-mirror that acts AS IF you could make choices with computer-advantage. Then this Trust Map that it infers from Trust Networking, its own computational capacity, having mirrored the daemon as well as possible and general Daiddaemonic work. Then it is able to in a very nuanced way know which information is very comfortably shared with who - on a case by case and person by person and \"all things considered\" basis. And of course - it being your machine-mirror it also knows things like to which degree you are severely hurt by which information divulged beyond what you would have wanted had you acted yourself (with whatever difference between daemon and Aiddaemon there is) or if you had known some greater unforseen aspect to it. All this is of course, essential parts of its functioning, to know such things as well as it possibly can.)\n2. They communicate will-field physics as well as you probably would want to do as well. As it is tremendously useful in seeing your will-manifest.\nHowever, in the Pseudonymous world, you will have Trust Maps of the information that flows concerning will-field physics, and much will-field physics will by unknown to you without broadcasting actors wanting you to know about it: Their Trust Beliefs allowing you to \"know about it\". This allows you to weigh it massively in terms of beliefs. On top of that, it is also infeasible to do all the intelligence work and attempt at then predicting will-manifestation pathways - including will-coalescence - on your own. Therefore, the Trust Maps of yours once again shine! Because, they allow you to outsource the computation and communication needs (you don't to capture information on your own from around the globe); and many core functionalities like Multaiddaemons are fundamentally founded upon Trust Networks.\n3. On top of that anonymous gossip flows as a trustless - unaccountable - though PoP (sybil and other things) secure information. This becomes the background-noise or background-fields to the will-field physics.\n4. Your Aiddaemon can help you in many ways. But one of the ways would be to play an LLL game where it is AR that shows color saturations and hue changes among other visual alterations. To encode a lot of information in intuitive visual communication.\n5. You will probably then feel \"drawn\" towards certain enticements of fulfilling will that would have become tangible steps or directions in physical space to move in. Afterall, if you don't at all, then perhaps you should re-evaluate what your Aiddaemons tries to help you fulfill: Something that speaks to you and also where will-manifestation actualizational layer can provide paths towards it that isn't totally deflating. (Hint: \"Aiddaemon. Give me both most will-economic paths and greedy algorithmic property pathway to my will.\" or better yet: \"There seems to be a mismatch in your mirroring of me, that results in paths not being greedily will-economic enough. Let's fix that.\" or better yet [Unnecessary Discussion. Problem Solved Without Effort Out of the Box])\n\n**Privacy Through Scale**:\n- Individual predictions encrypted\n- Multiple predictions bundled\n- Perturbations mixed at each hop\n- Source can become untraceable (Trustless anonymous version (Monero but PoP mining)); or it can be trust constrained or trust conflated (Multaiddaemons)\n- Only patterns remain\n\n### Will-Field Physics\n\n**Global Substrate Creation**:\n- Millions of anonymous predictions\n- Gravitational-like perturbations\n- No names or identities\n- Pure mathematical resonance\n- Ambient intelligence emerges\n\n**Local Experience**:\n- Feels like intuition\n- \"I just felt drawn there\" (Daiddaemonic encoding schemes that become intuitively emotional (and cleverly exploiting extant intuitive emotion of sensory input (Like that of radiance and saturation and brighter hue giving a daemon certain emotion and so on.)))\n- Synchronicities with what would previously have been astronomical serendipity becomes second nature every day occurences. \n- Meaningful encounters explode (Every encounter cross-pollinates or cross-provides your total will and being: the subjective optimized will-economic topology with near-optimal paths chosen through it)\n- Life becomes more resonant and harmonious; insofar one lives locally (One's real life and not Risk World Domination Life (Anyone wanting World Domination Fails short of the 0 position (To Win World Domination under this order means Technological Supremacy FAR beyond anyone else (So it fundamentally means secrecy and progressing technology ahead decade after decade. Century after century. Or however long it takes to reach not only a Horned position. But the 0 position of Lord of Destruction. Master of Life and Death on the Planet against anyone at a whim.(And so. You can try to prevent this from happening. And Good Luck to you. Perhaps you can thwart technological progression that is explicitly directed towards it. But the problem is the combinatorial nature of technological application and power; as well as Bostrom Vulnerable World points. (It is therefore, totally unfeasible to imagine our current world ALL agreeing to shut down progress with no one in charge and no one able to break free to pursue progress of technology (And so the Threat of 0 is a reality. It will happen.)))))))\n\n### Multi-Scale Coalescence\n\n**Personal Scale**:\n- Two people finding deep connection\n- Small group achieving flow state\n- Family harmonizing activities\n\n**Community Scale**:\n- Neighborhoods organizing naturally\n- Interest groups self-assembling\n- Local cultures emerging (True human plurality revealed by sudden coming together in kind of something deep and foundational. As well as acute proclivity or inclination or inspiration.)\n\n**Civilization Scale**:\n- Mass movements coalescing\n- Cultural renaissances beginning\n- New civilizations budding\n\n### The AR Phase Engine for Will\n\nThis presents a particular AR LLL game that is based upon \"These Systems\"; such that it can provide Phase Engine; and reduce mutually-exclusive will by infrastructure of the game. In this case, it allows for territorial zero-sum to become greater than zero. Both in terms of time-share use of the same space (1) and simultaneous use (2). It enables both things in different ways -- respectively described with the following \"Dual Function System\".\n\n**Dual Function System**:\n\n**1. Navigation Display** (Will paths made visible):\n- Red saturation: Romantic potential\n- Green: Economic opportunity\n- Blue: Learning possibilities\n- Purple: Healing connections\n- Gold: Creative collaboration\n- Silver: Spiritual resonance\n\n**2. Phase Separation** (Multiple realities coexist):\n- Same location, different hyperrealities\n- Incompatible aesthetics in separate phases (Like that of making your enemies ugly; while those you can \"in your most intelligent way\" infer are internally beautiful - in your eyes - made beautiful in a superficial sense -- in your eyes)\n- Some people only exist in certain phases (Blurred out only gray geometric person and their other sensory outputs or effects are sensory-cancelled (like noise cancelling technology))\n- Out-of-phase elements muffled or hidden (Existent but dampened effect. \"The AR Dream of the Autist\" (Aiddaemon instantly notices the annoyance I have with some sensory aspect or particular person; then instantly muffles it and progressively until I am unbothered but still able to display willingness for attention towards it: Such that the aiddaemon would bring it into sensory neutral or even amplified states (In the same manner)))\n- Complete experiential separation possible (No. Only in VR is it possible with COMPLETE. There exists some fundamental physical reality that one has to deal with in order to navigate in AR mode. (And probably depending on Crucible Triad there will be laws concerning what kind of modulations are acceptable there (When in Rome do as the Romans)))\n- Physical proximity without experiential collision (What matters to the experience can often be made entirely disjoint: Since it is often about some atmosphere, setting and persons there (Including such things as music (The system allows for many live bands to play in the same space by sensory selection or attention)) But of course, if it is about the physical constraints, then of course, it will not be experientially uncolliding, but will instead all deal with the same physical constraints. Be it a building, or Mona Lisa painting, or a sunset from a outpost viewpoint, or whatever else it may be where the physical constraints are key to the experience.)\n\n**Dynamic Response**:\n- Colors shift with your state (This is Daiddaemonic ES specific; but it could very well be: Mode shifting. As it allows for the same information stream to be multiplexed and so much more versatile.)\n- Phases adapt to daemon resonance (This is about will-coalescesing with others that be viewed as different Phases of experience. This is often quite useful, as to have some sort of aejective reality that is shared (Similar to Metroversal instead of Universal. But here it is aejective instead of objective; \"mass psychosis by intent\": To augment reality in a coherent manner with others to allow for aejective realities or phases))\n- Patterns adapt to outcomes with a hyper focus on the daemon in question. Everything of these systems are pointed towards Man as the Ultimate End for the edge of - or the building blocks of - this entire system.\n- Feedback improves predictions (However that feedback is conveyed)\n- System \"learns\" your preferences (This is fundamentally about Aiddaemon being a good mirror of daemon; and aiddaemon able to leverage and intelligently guide such that the daiddaemon lives much better daemon than daemon alone.)\n- Phase boundaries is will (I have given the example of a will being \"I only want to experience a phase where everyone adores me and loves me as their God; which usually results in a phase where they are almost or entirely alone.\" or the worse version \"I want a phase where everyone I encounter want me to abuse them violently and sexually in extremely desperate begging and pleading for me to do so\" These sorts of wills will probably see themselves without any others to share their Phase with. Their aejective reality is entirely subjective)\n\n### Trust Networks Amplify Coalescence\n\n**Information Flow Benefits**:\n- Learn what others actually want; Usually you don't; like... At all.. But your COALESCESE with others in very NEBULOUS and CROSS-INTENTIONAL ways that allows for Will-economic optimal paths concerning \"everything the Aiddaemon has been able to learn about you and infer about the state of reality to predict what choices or steps in life might serve you the best\"\n- Discover compatible gatherings\n- Share successful patterns\n- Avoid known mismatches\n\n**Network Effects**:\n- Larger network = greater scale orchestration beyond trustless versions. \n- Diverse network = something-not-you options made more reliable (Note: \"You are diverse\" and \"diversity\" means that which \"isn't your diversity\"; since totally homogenous \"copies of you in will network\" would provide \"every flavour of you options\". But still, to be \"thrown out and perturbed is nice. So Diversity.\")\n- Trusted network = safer exploration; much better predictions.\n- Active network = more opportunities; strength of signals and real-time intelligence much better\n\n### Practical Implementation\n\n**Personal Level**:\n```yaml\nhuman_asked_for_k_will_profile:\n  current_desires: [{BlobClassRef: 12883, ES: \"DEEP_CONVERSATION\"}, {BlobClassRef: 17283, ES: \"CREATIVE_PROJECT\"}, {BlobClassRef: 1273, ES: \"EXERCISE_PARTNER\"}]\n  energy_state: { BlobClassRef: 293, ES: \"EVENING_CONTEMPLATIVE\" }\n  openness: {BlobClassRef: 23, ES: \"MEDIUM_HIGH\"}\n  constraints: [{BlobClassRef: 672, ES: \"LOCAL_ONLY\"}, { BlobClassRef: 48919, ES:  \"QUIET_ENVIRONMENT\" }]\n```\n\n**Facilitator System Redundancy Services in case of failure**:\n- Event timing optimization\n- Space energy management\n- Group composition advice\n- Activity suggestion\n- Conflict prevention\n(In general the building blocks are the intelligence substrate that enables or generates these emergences)\n\n### The Economics of Connection\n\n**Value Creation**:\n- Successful coalescence creates value\n- All participants benefit\n- Positive-sum interactions\n- No extraction needed in the sense of \"third parties being needed and thus being justified in profitting of it\"\n\n**This is parasites trying to infiltrate what the system makes obsolete: Payment Models for will-manifestation infrastructure. This is utter garbage but will stay here as a reminder of how absolutely wrong and terribly misunderstood the following 3 points are**:\n- Pay for introduction\n- Subscribe to predictions\n- Tip for successful connection\n- Invest in community spaces\n\n### Beyond Human Coalescence\n\n**Will Exists at Every Scale**:\n- Atoms \"will\" to bond\n- Cells \"will\" to organize\n- Ecosystems \"will\" to balance\n- Planets \"will\" to orbit\n- All can be understood as coalescence and will to disentangle. Like that of the massive meteor and earth.\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n**Privacy Protection**: Gossip can be anonymous; easily.\n**Outcome Honesty**: Failed coalescence becomes evolutionarily deselected as will-economic topometers.\n**Pattern Diversity**: Any types of connection supported\n**Cultural Sensitivity**: Local patterns reveal will-economic costs when violating something others enjoy. \n**Individual Sovereignty**: Is free to always choose differently\n\n### The Coalescent Future\n\nWhen will coalescence reaches maturity:\n- Every desire finds will-economic expression; it can mean simulated \"others\"; when it is highly mutually exclusive and unable to find will-coalescence.\n- Loneliness becomes becomes navigational choice; with a few exceptions of those who are willed disentangled by everyone in the most extreme manner of The Crucible Triad exclusion from every zone other than Planetary (Devil's Mercy rules here).\n- Creativity explodes with the assumption of actually being able to unleash and manifest one's creativity with \"aligned\" others; allows for moment to moment increase of creativity in relation to the old versions.\n- Conflict that is insisted upon (where normal leverage dynamics can't dissuade towards will-disentanglement (Often due to categorical needs of some zero-sum reality (Like Jerusalem is any example of (Again, it is easy to do the AR time-sharing or will-coalescence in time to allow for sharing of the space; or even AR Phase Engine variety where one experiences different realities and the other denominations are muffled or grayed/blacked out)))) and able to occur in some Triad or virtual space: becomes domain of human creativity of how to solve it.\nOne suggested manner of bridging conflicts that can't be solved by the System; is to introduce \"The Metagame of World Dynamics\": The gamification of a conflict (A less than \"Raw Might Display\" game). Here one progressively by winning or losing, occupy or vacate more of the zero-sum resource. A winner-takes-all gamification is also possible, like the one in Troy, where the Spartans deal with another or some Celtic tribe, and instead of killing each other, they decide to gamify it: Their best man against the others' best man; Boagrius versus Achilles. Whereupon Aggammenon wins the celtic tribe as another legion of his, due to Achilles slaying Boagrius. This reduces the \"destruction of total raw might display significantly\"; and we already have proof of it working when rationalized why one should play within the rules of the game: Mutually Assured Destruction, Laws of War, WMDs at large and so on. You can do what you want, but the suggested Ubiquity Law is 123 MBC. And so the above scenario of Lethal combat is dissuaded or disencouraged.\nLet's just put it this way: I would have like Boagrius to have lived and to have at least had the Ajax end at the Gates of Troy. Or better yet: A long and full life of conquest (conquest is systematized and made gradual first in terms of the system of the ability to leverage a ubiquity law like MBC into place. See also MIRA or Triads or NSS or whatever else or capitalism or ownership or whatever. But also the Raw Physical Might becomes not categorically excluded from conquest dynamics, and are instead included in this Metagame of World Dynamics where one gamifies what can't be solved otherwise. As a bridging from \"opinion and consensus and law\" towards Raw Might Display -- The many many steps to settle and lose by physical might or mind confrontation in games; without escalating and needing massive revenge due to loved ones dying or being hurt and so on. Also, it allows for economies and Triad loss and gain of territory to be structured around these games which collectively or in their totality/sum are names Metagame of World Dynamics (See roblockroblask or something banned X account.)); or whatever will he has, without the need to die.\n- Humanity harmonizes (Which most fundamentally means: Becomes ordered in kind in space and time or at least in essential parts of actuality)\n\nNot through forced unity but through discovered resonance. Unity is had, by other humans, becoming as unthreatening to what you will, as a puppy is. That is most simply will-disentangle from you by will-economic drives. When the other humans are not a sore in your eye, or at least not robbing you of the apple of your eye and ability to manifest your will somewhere, then: It becomes much easier to have unity, as the name of union wouldn't be a lying one covering one's total disempowerment and destruction (Like modern nation states or EU and so on mostly does towards its inhabitants).\nNot through categorization but through pattern recognition that allows for human will to manifest and the consequence side-effects of it. Not through control but through facilitation.\n\nThe infrastructure exists to serve this: computation finds patterns, electricity powers gatherings, water sustains bodies, food fuels connection, shelter for local climate allows for space utilization and \"new beginnings\" or \"founding of Durotar\".\n(There you have the primary motivation for the authoring of these documents. To bring about a memetic change by real alternative to world organization: That allows for going free and beginning again anew and according to one's own will without that which ruins any inkling of trying to manifest it).\nAll utilities ultimately serve the meta-utility of will coalescence.\nWhich again is incentivized to facilitate the subsistance or attractiveness of for others, due to it becoming more will-economic to will-disentangle.\n\nThis is why we build - not for technology itself but for what it enables. Every technical system, every trust network, every discovered pattern serves the ultimate purpose: helping conscious beings find each other for will-amplification in manifestational capacity and especially to avoid all those which thwart it or ruin it: Will-disentanglement. And to create together what we really dream of in the brief time we share.\n\n### The Infinite Game\n\nWill coalescence is never \"solved\" because, but it will be solved:\n- People change continuously\n- Desires evolve endlessly\n- Patterns shift constantly\n- Mystery remains always\n- Discovery continues forever\nIt is however solved, because at some state of the new world order, these changes are instantly appeasable or approachable. There isn't a gray sky or wall between a path towards what you want (for almost anyone... Again, if NOBODY wants you, then you're alone and then it is you and the universe in your own empty Triad lot by the Mercy of The Devil (My initial suggested setting is hackney zoning of desert lands with good water supply for Devil's Mercy land. Alternatively Islands or Arctic climate islands or places). But of course, this too can change over time.).\n\nThe system succeeds not by eliminating the unknown but by making exploration safer, richer, and more likely to satisfy the deep will that moves through all things - the will to connect, create, and become.\n\n---\n\n*This document synthesizes all previous utilities into their ultimate purpose.

Markets & Value Discovery\n\n## Subjective Value and the End of \"Market Price\"\n\n### The Illusion of Equilibrium\n\n**The Great Lie**: \"Market price represents objective value\"\n\n**Reality**: Every transaction occurs at subjective values (But most do not know how to value anything; so they simply accept the terms at which \"the market\" seem to sell them at. If it is simply not profitable, many take a loss anyway, then most quit manufacturing after a while.)\n- Seller values money more than item (Or something money is proxy for, that can't be acquired without money otherwise)\n- Buyer values item more than money (Or something those quantity of money would have been proxy for otherwise)\n- The \"market price\" is just edge transactions (The reason why we can talk about a \"market price\" is because most persons are lemmings. Unable to value anything on their own. So, instead, they simply go with what the \"market\" (others with edge dominating position or volume) have sold it as; While there is of course some relation to alternative-use-of-scarce-resources (supply/demand scarcity when faced with demand makes the price) and labour-theory-price (The price or costs of production and labour put into it determines the pricing (Or ought to)) and so on (It all, of course has constraints to pricing; The former in things that are not artifically scarce; The latter in what is mass produced and industrialized as a lower limit of price.) But mostly, pricing is simply psychosis of those determining the money flow; in a \"capitalism 2.0 world\" (Where Natural Selection dominates above property rights, aka: Capital can be conquered world) where no parasitism exists (\n    Usury, lending, access to facilities is profit oriented and not Natural Selection oriented (Their own terms: Maximum utility of something: But will-economic instead of capital); Locked position of inability to avoid massive extraction of any work one does (\n    real alternatives and opportunities; Most persons experience extraction of their wealth, merely to survive with basic necessities: at rates of over >95% (If they do productive wealth generating work: >99.9% 1000-fold work to have it (Consider the house building man))\n\n    (Income: 30-55% taxation (On any hard-earned money (The easy earned is usually taxed much less));\n    Goods/Services higher cost: 25-10,000,000%: VAT+Private_VAT(\n        Like Amazon or other market infrastructure (\n            Node domination, they don't provide the service (\n                That persons post their products or content on their site: They merely profit from their position (Like many other Capital or non-responsive to NS protocols or systems) \n                )\n            )\n        );\n    Amortized borrowing with defaults across the money supply: {{This is hard to calculate the effect of. But let's say: Your money is worth a lot less. Your contracts depreciate in any money (Which is from employer to employee and so on) massively: The direct command of hard-earned money is made a lot less..}}\n    Usury: This adds an extra layer to the above, causing massive extraction layer on all activity, in the same way that states do with taxation parasitism: So too usury does at all points of interaction of the market (Almost everyone has a loan with usury that they have to cater to: Inflate the pricing and make it all more costly: Higher friction on any activity in the market (And you may ask why? Because, borrowing is fundamentally !!!INVESTMENT!!! and when an economy invests then it profits. Has always been so, if Caesar or Pharaoh or a \"democratic state\" or a \"venture capitalist\" is able to say to a person who really wants to do something: \"Here! Now you can simply command the global market to work for you and bring you the things you need. In these quantities. But, as a 'Thank You Money Master Man' Then you have to pay an interest to me for having conjured the money for you (modern Fiat); Or fractionally reserved pretended to have the money for you (Though I only have a 1000th of what I claim; And it isn't mine, but these stupid cattle folk they give their hard-earned money to me such that i can make these choices of investment for them. Who will have the doors opened to them as we conjure more and more money into the world); \"))\n    Capital ownership with profit extraction for access: Rent-seeking.\n        Imagine a world where all is bought up; and all these owners of what is, choose to compete amongst each other for demand of them owning everything or close to it. What happens? Unless altruist, they will end up simply overpricing everything to extract profit, then make their facilities scarce, such that high price does not mean high vacancy, even if it does, it isn't a real issue, so long as persons will sell their soul for 30 years to have roof over their head.\n        Rent seeking. And it exists on every single domain of markets. Where \"We have to get it.

Attention economy. Things like product juxtaposition or ability to determine which product over which product, usually by lying or using psychological hacks to make one product \"seem\" better than the other.\n        Take only advertisement market corruption: US$1.16tn.\n        That is to say, there is an extra US$1.16tn extracted by parasites for having facilitated a zero-sum game of attention-economy of their users who they then spend their time engineering to have keep their attention on their products.\n        That is, \n        (1) they in turn make a product success dependent on \n            (1.a) paying the attention-mafia to be seen and \n            (1.b) mind-manipulator PR folks to usually lie about their product in relation to other products. \n        This increases **prices on all products**; by every product having not only market-platform parasitism of Private_VAT but also in being seen by the consumer.\n        **Removes the efficiency of the market to provide the best product for the consumer or potential demanders of it**\n        \"The fair juxtapositioning of products\" denied is what they profit from. (Which is to be expected by The Jew).\n        (2) They have turned it into a ZERO-SUM game.\n        (3) They massively employ Lawfare against their competitors; Often wrap it in \"political or ethical terms\" that their enemies \"MUST be defeated\" and that \"They are dangerous\". And often they do it in highly nepotistic terms colluding with their \"compatriots\" across all sectors to facilitate the hardest blows to anyone not conducive to their supremacy. The Jew. And their Goyim and Golems (Like normal cattle lemming populations and the state brutes)\n        (4) And they have made their industry model to earn money by basically hijacking persons attention for as long as possible; with \"freedom for whatever that addictive media is to them; or their inability to deny themselves it\". Which causes MASSIVE decrease in civilizational productivity; extreme suffering by failing life and in general fast-track to societal collapse of so many persons without any stake at all in society; Having wasted their lives by the modern drug dealers (JUST LIKE IN EUROPE THROUGHOUT TIME WITH WHATEVER DRUGS THEY CAN FIND: THEY HAVE !NO LOVE! FOR THEIR POPULATION. They SEEK TO EXTRACT and THAT IS ALL.)\n\n    Lawfare: Jure is used against anyone who isn't already massively rich who can simply write it off as expenses to their company and deduct it in taxes. It is Law that functionally only works for those who is willing to martyr themselves in debt for it in hopes of winning. Or else those with company profit they can subtract it from before any sort of taxation (Something that isn't afforded a normal person: Though they could make \"such a lawfirm\" (We get what we deserve: Everyone running of the cliff))\n\n    \"As a service\". Most things use the above dynamics, to position themselves in infrastructure that depends on it being used to be valuable. Which causes someone who is able to \n        (1) get the funding/loan \"investment\" \n        (2) get the attention mafia access (Pay to win or \"network well\"/nepotism/ethnotribalism) to even \"be a product seen\" \n        (3) Lying \"Public Relations\" psychological manipulation \n        (4) Lawfare/state-regulation their way to market \"allowed for their product\"; Anyway after all of that or simply \"being the winning piece in the market to some infrastructure out of many providers of the infrastructure\" Then they make it a permanent cost upon everyone and not in a maintenance, nor in a \"I will get rich for winning that infrastructure success game we played many together and I won (Usually by MASSIVE filthy tactics and mistreatment of others; like sweatshops or doing anything that is cheaper; or worse products but establishing position faster; or safety and so on)\"; No but in a way that is: \"I will milk it for all its worth. Get as fat as I possibly can. Profit AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE\" (Which is equivalent to saying being as massive a parasitical load without abandoning of \"my service\" for those without users or lawfared into non-existence like most \"alternatives platforms\" and so on).\n        (5) States do the same thing: They make an infrastructure and these filthy politicians use it to milk it for all its worth against their citizens: Take public transport in Denmark. Whether bridges built or trains. Or any other topic: They try to extract as much as possible: Then squander the money on bureaucracy and pseudo-work (Usually because of their philosophy prevents them from doing anything sensible and instead have to follow hyper-retarded expertsystems they generate from counter-productive work against each other trying to dominate each other; or at least ruin the others' policies; or at least get the totality of it be a structure no has thought through or believe in: The Compromise of iterative happenstance of parliament and the de facto of random \"blindly indiscriminately employed gray statesmen\" who then apply the law and domination onto all).\n        Anyway: States built infrastructure, then do not release parasitism of ROI (that's a meaningless term from a state's perspective: They exist SOLELY to provide for the people it is an incorporation of), but continue forever with the next iteration of senseless flag-waving party/club-pushers; who then see \"utility\" in not making the unpopular choices of \"retracting the state-provisions\" when the economic can't afford the expenses they have written down in their HYPER RETARDED EXPERT SYSTEM AND CHAOTIC EXECUTION BY RANDOM \"Educateds\" (Which is the important part in wielding the control into reality of a state or pooled power institution (From low authority like Blackstone to high authority like US Government)).\n        (6) Insurance and Health Care. Whether government Jews or private Jews. They run it. And extract as much as possible with their profit oriented LYING philosophies, such as: \"Well, if higher demand and low supply, then very profitable and therefore many such to supply, and therefore it you get the problem efficiently solved\". Or some other Milton Friedman, Von Misses or Ayn Rand HYPER RETARDED SHIT. But what happens? Where does the surplus value of persons trying to pool their wealth into dealing with unfortunate-life circumstances offset by amortization across many lifetimes/lives (insurance and sickness treatment). ??? ??? Does it go into R&D and general Welfare or Sickness Treatment or resources to deal with catastrophes??? NOPE! A BIG FAT LIE. It goes into the hands of long nosed beaky eyed filthy fucking mole and rat men who profit as much as they can and through it into some retarded firework shit and command a bunch of women and useless men to do massive amount of pseudo-work to then get fed from their extreme parasitic extraction of productive populous. (And I don't care about your sensitivities of \"uhhh the jew\" and \"uhhh woman and useless men\"; as if I care. Pseudo-work is a massive burden and YES women are MASSIVELY employed in pseduo-work: But progressively also men. And in terms of WHO IS DOING THIS? IT IS THE FUCKING JEWS AND THEIR SHABBOS GOY REPLICATES. Those who have READ THEIR SHIT PHILSOPHIES OR IMITATE THEM.\n        MBAs are JEWs. And most office workers including bureaucrats and politicians and lawyers and so on are pseudo-workers (Three kinds: The one who does no useful work. The one who does useful work only within a silly game. Like \"democracy\" or \"law\" of those states. Which is wholly unnecessary if not for a retarded system. And Thirdly: Those that do work that is basically \"fireworks\"). And most \"healthcare\" workers are pseudo-workers most of the time. And many many more.)\n        (7) But of course, worst of all: The products that are de facto engineered to ruin you. Whether psychologically like most mass media/doom-scroll or porn or whatever. Or else somatically: Like poisonous food and externalities; that then accumulate through time in persons. Reducing their overall ability to be productive or functioning or happy or healthy or make families/reproduce and so on. This is from big-pharma pushing their insane pills on 50% of the population (at some point in their lives) (neuro altering and by that massively body altering; usually hormonally and mood wise; sometimes somatic sensation like inability to orgasm and so on); to things like McDonalds and Doritos and so on: That ruin their health of persons in general by having engineered no-nutriousnous food content with massive taste and addictive signalling (industrial scale searching for how to trick humanity into eating as much as possible of what is bad for them and has HUGE externalities of animal slaughter and welfare as well as poisoning of the environment causing further civilizational and everything else collapse)\n        (8) TELL ME ABOUT ANY GOODS OR SERVICE. And I WILL SHOW YOU how the WINNER and PROFITER became the ONE MOST FUCKING RETARDED AND EVIL! In your SHIT OF A SYSTEM! INCLUDING YOUR SHIT STATES AND ATTEMPT AT REVOLUTIONS PRIOR.\n\n    I have A TON more of these points. But I WILL NOT SAY IT. BECAUSE YOU ALL FUCKING DESERVE IT.\n    )\n\n); ), \nno corruption of the market exists and goods/services isn't mostly machine/facility/land ownership dependent and massively responsive to human-will or world-will in all its human constraints between each other (NSS Protocols), Then: pricing would be much more bound to reality in utility provided to persons at large. Then if you add Rationality (intelligence, communincation and externality empowerment for everyone; alongside making it VISIBLE WITH EVERY CHOICE THEY MAKE WHAT PREFERENCES THEY ACTUALLY HAVE. Instead of what THEY CLAIM TO HAVE. TALK IS CHEAP. WALK.) and Break-The-Lemming-mindset (HERE! NOW YOU CAN SEE! EYES TO SEE! NOW! DARE TO WILL YOUR WILL AND BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE INSTEAD OF WHAT OTHERS SAY! Then SEE THE CONSEQUENCES IN WILL-ECONOMIC TERMS AND ADJUST FROM THAT: BUT KEEP YOUR WILL KNOWN TO YOURSELF AT LEAST (Say, I COULD eat dairy: But I know the dairy industry is HYPER RETARDED and the only way they have been able to make milk flow from cow is through constant impregnation and killing of the calves (Breeding. To make chicken do eggs everyday took how many generations of reproduction? (But again: They don't treat chicken right either: They have been bred into economic utility and being bound to HEINOUS carnal cages of immense suffering for the short time they live, then killed. We are MUCH MUCH MUCH WORSE THAN NATURE. WE ARE THE DEVIL. WE ARE THE EVIL UPON THIS WORLD. (What do we make? What does nature make? From death and suffering. In what quantities do we subject suffering and meaningless unfulfilled life with feedback of reproduction to it? We generated suffering machines that are forced to reproduce and live mostly only until the bones have settled and meat built upon it: If they're lucky (Lambs are killed often in weeks or way before adulthood; same with calves (Do it with your carnivore beloved dogs instead.))))). So I won't. And in the same way I COULD buy drink coffee and so on. But I won't. I don't want to finance them. And I COULD eat candy and all sorts of shit products: But I will do it VERY SCARCELY and try to find alternatives that IS NOT engineered for addiction, but rather engineered for health with side-effect of being sweet or something) ... OR. WILL. I? That's the question. Once it becomes VISIBLE TO YOU. YOU WALK. YOU DO NOT TALK. YOU WILL KNOW! THAT IT MATTERS. YOU WILL SEE THE EXTERNALITIES OR EFFECTS OF YOUR CHOICES \"all-things-considered\".), Well: >D I am ONLY scratching the surface of my complaints and accussations I will bring upon you all. (As an example take the 10 million BABIES you have killed. That is EXCLUDING the undeveloped embryo abortions or \"barely a brain\" fetus \"abortions\" (murder of lowlife humanity that we LOVE THE MOST) so on.))\n- Most people value things differently than edge price\n\n**Stock Market Example**:\n- Apple trades at $180 (Which is to say; Mindless \"profit seekers\" believe \"price will go up further for whatever irrational causal reason behind it\" thus making it \"rational\" to invest)\n- This is just where highest buyer meets lowest seller\n- Millions think it's worth more (not selling)\n- Millions think it's worth less (not buying)\n- The \"price\" represents almost no one's actual valuation (3,02 trillion USD is the current \"price\" of apple. The \"belief\" of its value when buyer meets seller. That is to say: They could buy 7,500 highest end cutting edge SOTA mass-chip mass-producing machines of which only 15 have been sold in 2025. That is to say: You can with the valuation of Apple, make 7,500 Apples. Who all compete against each other: But will not stand a chance because of the previous section on how the market is broke and corrupt and unresponsive but instead nepotistic node domination across all sectors. And again: Here Apple is also clear with their Lawfare not only against their competitors, but also against those who try to bring them to justice on their exploit and abuse around the world, and to their political enemies who are deemed \"no place for them. No platform for them.\" What makes Apple valuable? It's employees? (DO they get a good share in this or is it random profit seekers? and capital owners?) Or is it its brand? The Human Capital vested in Apple products and loyal to them: Perhaps even have part of their Identity being \"An Apple product person instead of a Windows or Android kinda person\". And so on. It is so fucking frustrating and you should all read Thus Spake Zarathustra)\n\n### Transaction Waste and Fair Pricing\n\n**\"Fair Price\" = Maximum Waste**:\nIf you'd equally take either side of a trade, there's no benefit to either party. All real value comes from subjective differences.\nIf you will regret having taking a side of a trade, once real alternatives were allowed to bubble to the fore, by the lemming masses rejecting their false idols of The Jew philosophy and in part The Jew. Or say, once \"more information was divulged about the trade and the goods and services to which it relates\". Or let's say when it was deliberately avoided investigated, no responsibility, no accountability or even outright lied about, then: You can say it is NOT a fair price the trade was had with.\nOr, if it in some ways, if informed enough and able to disentangle the many paradoxically driven or opposing desires, will, intent and emotion of a person; Then able to have the person do a much more HOLISTIC assessment of whether to do the trade, THEN, you could call it: Will-economic \"fair\" Trading.\n\n**Value Creation Through Difference**:\n- Farmer values wheat at $100 (cost + small profit)\n- Baker values wheat at $200 (can make $300 of bread)\n- Trade at $150 benefits both\n- The $100 gap is NEW VALUE CREATED (Alchemyst might! :P)\n\n**Person-to-Person Services**:\n- Massage gives pleasure to both\n- Conversation enriches both minds\n- Dance creates joy for both\n- Teaching deepens understanding for both\n- The \"work\" IS the mutual benefit\n\n**Person-to-many Services**:\n- Lecture, or debate or discussion between a few enrich many.\n- Theater or live music by a few enrich many\n- Concert or festival or any large gathering of persons become latent postive-sum effect upon the sensation or experience. Including gatherings that amplify that \"religious\" or \"sacred\" or \"holy communion\" sensation.\n- Proliferation of \"good choices\" amplify the ease with which good choices can be had. (The paved roads, the gregariousness of social company and acceptance, the scaled and made efficient, the default without thinking solutions, the adapted to every kind of context and scenario situation)\n- Proliferation of \"good ideas\" spread exponentially with human-integrated positive-sum emotion for both parties if done right.\n\n### Trust Networks as Snake Filters\n\n**Current Markets**: Full of deception\n- Used cars with hidden problems\n- Supplements with fake ingredients\n- Services that don't deliver\n- Credentials meaning nothing\n- Often the only accountability to be had is towards \"corporations\" or \"employees\": Rather, or almost never, those supposedly owning it; supposedly responsible for the operations of it: If not directly then by choosing the men or women to steer their ship of wealth and power.\n\n**Trust-Filtered Markets**:\n- See \"trust scores\"\\* (\"A network of PoPs that you dare infer information about concerning a particular issue towards your \"trust\" that this company will be accurate in your prediction of the will-economic effect towards the \"trade\"/interaction) from your network. (In the advent of this system: NOTHING is commercialized and EVERYTHING is made part of \"the market\" (aka \"informed will and interaction in the world\" Costs and Gain to be had by acts in life) Yes, you can commercialize things, but probably it is entirely without a point, since the system isn't 1-step thinking but can do much more elaborate projection of acts of persons into outcomes than regular administrators of today can: But it happens ground-up in this system. Will-economic per person, in their own, but empowered valuation of things. For better or for worse... But it LIBERATES in a sense that isn't fucking retarded and entangled to dominate each other. And it makes possible the real mechanism that \"democracies\" want to have: Feedback and leverage from the many or anyone onto whoever they want who might be in power or not. Their \"democratic and human rights institutions\" are in the way of doing what they intented or dreamed to do. To ask for \"allow it to happen somewhere\". These systems. That's all. See the html claude illustration stuff (broken but whatever); also you can get a feeling from \"floating-world-story.md\" that claude authored on context of Crucible world and 123404321 smt framework)\n- Learn from others' actual experiences; all the anecdotal information that science misses in their shallow analysis. Real full complexity pathfinding in the real world.\n- Bad actors become visible; and empowered to punish, work around or whatever you want. It is cost and gain. Will-economic. \"All things\" within the Crucible law of the place you've currently rallied to live in or created as your own. Your bad actors.\n- Quality naturally surfaces; This is again real full complexity pathfinding of the actualization layer towards human will. Obviously quality in all its multi-faceted multi-dimensional and subjective expression will matter: Exactly (perfect system assumption here. But TALK TALK: WALK! Let it happen SOMEWHERE. HUGE WORLD. SO MANY SHIT COUNTRIES. AND WASTED LAND. At some point there will be no excuse, and the excuses used against the system, will only be testimony to your own ineptitude or unwillingness; That is: Only you will be hurt by it. Only you will be stand naked as the fool. And it doesn't matter if it is because I said \"Jew\" or \"Negress\" or read AltHype and Breivik and Tarrant. You're STILL in the way. Despite my existence and your unwillingness to let it a choice between \"Old\" and \"these systems\" somewhere. (I didn't joke when I said I could save millions of lives each year. I kept showing you. Proving to you.)) as much as it does indeed matter to the person.\n\n**Information Flow Benefits**:\n- \"This mechanic actually fixed my car\"\n- \"That supplement helped my condition\" (This is probably rarely the case, though it could be for persons really looking into it. Mostly it will be \"condition\" obsolete. Instead much more holistic view of health or any problem. Then pathfinding that may include \"supplements\" (Better food or medicinal plants or medicine or whatever). But most likely simply become part of their will-economy. They can choose to do these things, but they will have visual indicater what works towards or against their discomfort or disease)\n- \"This teacher transformed my child\" ('teacher' 'transformed' 'my child' all of this useless shallow information without context of it all at the same time. And in relation to other paths or choices available towards their \"will to transform their child\" and \"the will of the child\" and \"expected will of the child in the future\"(?))\n- Collective intelligence emerges\n\n### Subjective Value Landscapes\n\n**Personal Value Maps**:\n- Heirloom priceless to family, not at all as valuable to others, not relatively speaking, not emotionally speaking, not if they had the same liquidity speaking.\n(And so too similarly The Jewels or Blooming Flowers of folk; and the treasured \"point of it all\" in relation to their nation/culture/civilization that these women or girls hold; It isn't \"understood well\" because Will-economics isn't a thing: In fact LAUGHING at a people crying to see themselves go into extinction or being robbed of their blood-treasure generation after generation is common. Without any \"ability\" to note such persons and signal back to them the degree of will-economic consequences it has. Rude! But I get it: A drawing of mohammad as a pig with a bomb in turban or something. Or saying \"The Power that is Jewry do bad things\". Is of course way worse. Or pointing out the OBVIOUS truth of Holocaust being false. Or 9/11 inside US/UK/Israel (Israeli/Zionist/Jewry/Christian/Power-To-West) job. And so on and so on.)\n- Medicine critical to patient, irrelevant to healthy\n- Enemy's restaurant has negative value to you (In many ways. Like being served by your enemy and he spits or makes bad food. Or in ways like him getting customers or \"fulfilling will\" being a bad thing: because you designate him enemy, why? And what does his empowerment mean?)\n- Your friend's art worth more than stranger's (An extra something that is all between you-two ceteris paribus or whatever)\n\n**Trust Affects Value**:\n- High-trust provider \"commands premium\" (Is will-economically better. Because what your intent was, is higher or lower, often on account of \"Trust\". But fundamentally, the ability to know such things, relies on Trust Networks)\n- Low-trust \"requires discounts\" (Again. The above parenthesis.)\n- Unknown providers must prove themselves (Are risky, but unknown providers is a startup-thing when trying to do something new in life. You don't even know yourself, if you did, then surely also some Trust Network effect would be there already. Or you could \"let them know\", by proof, by word or trust.)\n- Reputation becomes quantified asset\n\n### High-Leverage Actor Terraforming\n\n**How Billionaires Shape Markets**:\n\n**Example: Artisan Valuation**\n- Billionaire pays 1000x for handmade goods (What does it really do? In the old economic scheme this would make scarce the handmade goods and make the price much higher by the willingness of rich person paying 1000x for it suddenly. Perhaps some run-along effects making it 1100x more expensive. Thus making a profit for the Billionaire. What would it look like in the new model of will-economics? What is it that he intended, when he didn't have to consider everything a stupid 1d gate of money to do things? Perhaps he wanted to facilitate the growingbeds or infrastructure or community that well-suits artisanry and handmade goods. And so, his money is much better spend, trying to make an enchanting world framework of artisanry and leben: To make it \"an opportunity\" for others to embark upon and try to live it. Then perhaps it wasn't them, perhaps they can't stay in that place because Billionaire doesn't like them, perhaps they leave the place with an appreciation of it, perhaps to the degree of wanting to make \"another such place\" but where it isn't the same Sovereign (Billionaire who made it possible); But where it is instead themselves or someone else they trust would be that will. Perhaps they wish to make 1000 tiny Triads next to each other and nested in typical fashion next to each other. (How they nest in the Triad could be \"None of us above the other. But... We all have some realities to contend with: Like military protection. Like healthcare/sickness-treatment and access to doctors or fire departments and so on. So therefore we need to nest below some Sovereign who provides that. Then find the ones they want to. And yes, it may be the oxymoronic Sovereign or system-as-sovereign\" (Though I really do not recommend system-as-sovereign: At least not locally. Too many disputes when you could simply segment it. Rally when possible: If you have no to believe in and trust: \"Every man's home is his castle\" Own Triad Per House and Property. (You will do what you will do. It is called the Crucible for a reason. We shall see.. It can incorporate ANY system.))))\n- Creates economic attractor for craftsmanship (In the old system, it means capital flow to this market, which mean the quality of purchase move from \"enjoyers and appreciators\" of the artisanry to \"economic opportunists\" and with that quality of which artisanry goods are demanded change: In particular, the goods that is most economical. That would be something like Artisanry image while being mass-produced. Such as artisan-becoming-\"the-designer\"-furniture and so on.)\n- Mass production becomes less profitable (no. Not in old system. But in new system, IF it actually matters to people, then it can with the weight they want it to. And they'll have a much easier time creating the wealth conditions or circumstances around it to facilitate that way of life too. The way to get others' to will it: Story telling, enchanting world where it is part to the life and way of life there. Which in its most banal and de based form is called PR or advertisement (Which in its de facto form is simply psychological mind-manipulation industry))\n- Market reshapes around new values\n\n**Negative Terraforming**:\n- Refusing to buy from certain practices (This is the point, holistically speaking with all the impact of an act, will you do it or not. Like getting 10% discount in some goods you have or money (Not necessary but it is a nice psychological effect on people. Number up and down feels good. Power to make happen across my utility domain unto others in a 1d reduction instead of will-economic chains of actions etc.), but then having to give profit and gain to a person who otherwise is impacting the world ENTIRELY contrary to everything else you care about. And so on...)\n- Creates economic barriers (Economic barriers is a joke. They do it DIRECT transfer. Not even 2-step transitivity. These systems suggest HOLISTIC WILL-ECONOMIC ANY STEP TRANSITIVITY barriers. Total will-disentanglement is possible. \"As if they didn't exist: Out of My Actuality\" (This latter form requires Hard-lining others who prove leaky. Depending on the severity of the leak: total cut off or simply higher will-economic leverage in some sense.))\n- Harmful practices become unprofitable (Again. What does \"profitable\" mean? What does practices mean? Any act upon others will have consequences. Positive or negative. As it is in reality. The difference is empowerment to will-manifest (WM) (ultimately) which means will-coaleascence (WE) and will-disentanglement (WD) when talking about other humans and the gradient metricized view of it: Will-economy (WE))\n- Market evolution accelerated (Market evolution....)\n\n**Not Control But Influence**:\n- Can't force others' values (You can FORCE like States do now, AS SOVEREIGN IN YOUR TRIAD or similar fashion of system-as-sovereign with whatever is the actuator of it (But remember we do not accept run-away matrix like conditions. It will not be acceptable that you make LAWs or Non-Lethal Autonomous Weapons to be the actuators of the system against humans. Any work on Machine conquering man is viewed as extreme threat). There will be routing and \"borders\" to the degree it is necessary. Though USUALLY it will not because WC and WD and WE. Overtime: Actuality or will-economic consequences become dominated by \"spatial sorting\". Thus relocating into gradient and thus totally cheapened and relaxed order of the world is simply put: Economical. Will-economical. And if you disagree now. Then you most likely will not later, unless you stand against most of the will in the world at that point. Who like to make room and see the richness without strife and border conflicts and bad harmony bad will-economy between Triads. But there will be, some stubborn \"Viggos\" I call them: The Road Movie. They will experience something like that. Total will-economic shutoff total will-disentanglement except their stubborn Triad or perhaps even vacated Nation State / Territory Institution that remains. \"A King Of No One\". Again, If you didn't FEAR that I am right, then you would let me or others TRY something else. Somewhere. Take Denmark, there are PLENTY of unoccupied islands and territory or \"ghost towns\" where no one enjoys living. Turn it into Triadic zones and WOOPTIE. Then suddenly it will blossom. Or any other land on this godforsaken planet that is standing unused or used for unacceptable conditions of life and existence or external consequence (like rivers in India and China and Philipines and Africa that have helped create the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and supposed contribute with 90% of plastic pollution on the planet))\n- Can express own values powerfully (Act by act. Choice by choice. Valuation by valuation. This for that. But all domains. All things we can manage to incorporate in the interaction or trade or act)\n- Others freely choose response (Where there is no \"freeness to choose\" is in the Dominum of something else. There the \"dom\" part to free-will is had. Triad or Crucible Sovereignty System. Where you can express your free-will that dominates. That says: THIS WAY. And THIS WAY IT WILL BE. That is the power of the Sovereign in a Triad. To allow for the FULL SCOPE OF HUMAN FREEDOM. (MBC corrected and will-economic trade-offs and nesting law: Like that of police, fire department military and so on as I gave example to earlier.))\n- Landscape shifts organically\n\n### Professional Services Revolution\n\n**From Credentials to Outcomes**:\n\n**Current System**:\n- Lawyer with Harvard JD charges premium\n- Doctor with prestigious residency assumed competent\n- Engineer with certifications gets hired\n- Results disconnected from credentials\n\n**Trust-Utility System**:\n- Lawyer ranked by ...  (What does RANKING mean... In a hypersubjective and collective-solved by Trust Networks, PoP, PoU and Triads. What does \"a ranking mean\" and so what what should we write it is ranked by. Already told you: Will-manifestaion pathfinding or actualizational layer is the way. You get the ranking THAT MATTERS PER PERSON PER CASE)\n- Doctor ranked by \"patient will-manifestation pathway beliefs by using doctor for some particular Task\".\n- Engineer ranked by ... \n- Credentials become irrelevant: Indeed. OBSOLETE!\n\n**Market Implications**:\n- Village wisdom woman proves-better-pathway-to-will-manifest (Which includes having the father survive cancer; but not at cost of opportunity of a decent life for his children) licensed MD (Who has a 10x parasites on him and profitteers extracting immense wealth from everything from machines, medication!!!!, buildings, staff, administrators, conglomerate and all its employees and other branching of revenue from the hospital into other streams of money spending; as well as the probably heavily overpriced doctor who is made artifically scarce by making the entry to helping other persons be OUTLAWED and 10 YEARS OF $2e6 SPENT ON EDUCATION AND SO ON.)\n- Self-taught coder outperforms PhD (Which is quite common; If you're really good; you don't need to go to school and get a stamp. In fact IT MIGHT BE INTELLECTUALLY INSULTING TO GO THROUGH THE SCHOOLING.)\n- Experienced parent outranks child psychologist (What a surprise! It isn't a select few persons on the planet with \"an education\" who will be able to solve the particular psychological conumdrum or conditions that makes them have such issues: But rather a few or some from the many of all the persons on the planet (General Pathfinding hint.) AND the conditions under which they will THRIVE can be HAD by Will-coalescence, will-disentanglement and Triad SOVEREIGNTY and FACILITATION to forge THEIR WORLD; ESPECIALLY WITH BORDERS/GRADIENT-WD-WE-WC THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE WITHOUT THOSE THAT RUIN IT FOR THEM! That makes them feel WRONG or UNCOMFORTABLE or UNEASED or SELF-CONSCIOUS or demands of them to do things they can't do or function in. Or whatever it may be. Then on top of that: Once the brood is out of their neck, then: WC or coming together of ONLY those that REALLY heighten it: But with match making IN DEPTH and on their total real-time WM or WE viewpoints. And with GROWING plurality across the globe with hundred thousands or MILLIONS of Triads coming, dwindling and going as time passes on; And like the NSS Variant Mutations: So too THEY STAY in abstraction and remembrance able to be PROJECTED ONTO EARTH once again if they become \"the pathfinding solution\" that someone chooses to embark upon.)\n- Subjective-Merit emerges from WM results\n\n### Dynamic Pricing and Value Flow\n\n**Real-Time Value Expression**:\n- Urgent need increases personal value\n- Abundance decreases scarcity which allows for easier WM concerning that which is in abundance. But headlessly maximizing abundance means scarcity of that which is without it or alternative-use of the matter or the world or time spent by the person or ingestion of it and so on. So saying \"Abundance is good\" simply doesn't account for all the interesting aspects of what Abundance Means. Like \"Abundance of Plastic\" or \"Abundance of 'housing'\" When it means communist-capitalist-economic-bauhaus-homogenenized-across-all-the-world-making-all-the-world-without-escape-from-the-abundance. Or let's say \"Abundance of straw shorteners in all your wheat\" or \"abundance of glyphosate\" because \"abundance of wheat was good\" and \"abundance of sugary transfat food was massive supplied and offered as alternative in any situation to anyone no matter where they are or how pathological that environment is to them\". And so on. And so on. With Triads we get plurality of these things. Which mean there will be in Actualizational Layer clear Pathways of trying to be accepted into a Triad or going to Triad you're already in (Like let's say sea or ocean or whatever); where the environment is vastly superiorly aligned towards your holistic will. The Will-economics becomes almost zero. Or without cost. Everything already IS the way that helps you maximally towards your will. And such things. But this is prevented now, by capital or communist for that matter vast domination of anti-domination across the globe: Or LIBERALISM (And in part human rights. But human rights is as usually retarded. They try to make a MBC++ But they don't realize the fault in applying it to those fundamentally moving the world towards a better state in relation to their very own valuations or intent of the human rights: Because \"Law must be had equally upon all; In some silly expert system valuation of whether things are equal or not: 'Well, if it is within these 10 categories/projections we are allowed to look at, THEN it is the same, THEN we have to judge it EQUALLY'\" (There simply isn't much to do about this. Other than this: Stop hitting everyone with it. Focus on the Worst First: Globally but rather Actually Realizable in impact. And Let's put it this way: You prevent \"good stuff\" and you're \"the bad guy\" to those who deem it \"good stuff\". Simply as that.(So, Sovereignty DOMINATION \"human rights abuse!!!\" or \"authoritarianism! DANGER!\" then vermin serpentine snakes finding utility in your voice: \"ATTACK THEM! BOMB THEM!\" Or whatever else you might choose to say: Enemy. (MBC is your supersedent of the Planetary attempt. You can try to make your own. But beyond that it is Nesting at will. But with REAL HUMAN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR THRIVING AND WILL AND EMOTION AND INTENT AND ...................)))).\n- Trust relationships affect \"pricing\" (You get it now? How outdated that terminology is. Trust Networks is foundation that offers information intelligence and more to an individual without having to have a three letter agency with them or large bureaucratic agencies. But instead p2p solution to all of it. Empowered by these systems. Trust in the sense of Trust Networks has a consequence on beliefs and therefore computation of pathfinding to WM. But also beliefs about trusting another to do a task with all the contextual constraints (like privacy) obviously also affect the computation whether or not that trade/act is amongst good candidates of movements to WM. Or if flipped around and insisting that one make the multiple choices of possible acts to do one-self, then have the WE ranking of each show very different realities depending on all sorts of beliefs or knowledge that can be inferred about \"it all\" and \"the interactor\")\n- Context determines everything: Yes, because the world isn't our mountainridge talk with oblivion on either side. It is deep sentience of the many parts to us at the same time: All the things we can see - or at least feel while we focus on the mountainridge - all around us towards the horizon: As well as all the things that came before. So, a phrase is nothing. It could mean almost anything. Depending on Context. Ass.\n\n**Old-World weirdness of mercenary corrupted metrics: Multi-Currency Systems**:\n- Money for impersonal exchange (I don't understand it)\n- Trust scores for reputation currency (I don't understand it)\n- Time banking for community exchange (I don't understand it)\n- Barter for direct value swap (I don't understand it)\n- Gift economy for relationship building (I don't understand it)\n\n**New-World: Multi-Will-Economics Clusters**:\n- Tinker Bell is King.\n- If it matters to you: It matters.\n- If it matters to many of you: WC and with that extreme Leverage to WD.\n- If it matters to you alone against all other importance in the world: You can always make your own Triad and have it EXACTLY YOUR WAY without the domination from other persons by mutually-exclusive-will that unfolds when we have to cooperate, interact and ...\n- This causes any degree of will-economic isolation by simply making things so much against your will that it is unacceptable: All the way to the point of saying \"Fuck you all. I'm going to my own Triad without any nesting at all other than that which became Planetary or others' willing so much they couldn't resolve it with MIRA or Meta-gaming of World Dynamics; and so decided to destroy me. That degree of nesting: But only that degree\". Is the degree to which you can disentangle yourself from others and their oppression/domination. But, insofar, you don't want to be all alone, then some sort of will-economic considerations must be had. Where it isn't your will alone, but will-with-will over time, and initially it is mostly: Will-against-will. Because of chaos entropy philosophies. Like Liberalism, Communism, Capitalism and so on. (But these systems TRIES to not only solve will-against-will in the long term. But also very much vent the pressure acutely. If territory institutions FUCK OFF, then suddenly opportunity can be had by mere subsistence level funding. Which, again, a tiny country like Denmark could if they discarded their current system fund the world in making Triads. (It would STILL need the release of territory and perhaps even vacating sometimes by persons in space around the planet or \"at least somewhere\" that is WE in relation to WM you try to solve. Or the WC & WD that is had by it.))\n\n### Market Topology and Navigation\n\n**Markets as Landscapes**:\n- Hills where value concentrates\n- Valleys of low activity\n- Rivers of flowing exchange\n- Bridges between different economies\\*\\* (Will-coalescence zones; but otherwise yes it is very apt. It is the coming together and making high-density of will-with-will in depth of that will and being all things considered (If it matters to you it matters) that will make these spacetime pockets of \"economies\")\n\n**AR Market Visualization**:\n- See value gradients in space\n- Trust territories mapped\n- Opportunity flows visible\n- Will-Economic weather patterns (Like that of WD being upset. Then with the consequence \"flight\" movements; or else \"towards The Road\" impositions or leverage; amongst other things. The avoidance or avoiding. The new roads or exclusion.)\n\n### The End of Advertisement\n\n**Current Deception Model**:\n- Manipulate through imagery (Imagination instead of imaginary. Story telling, enchanting, coming together, manifesting and reaping the fruits of the reality of it: Instead of Public Relations or Propaganda. Then instead of Advertisement: Actualizational Layer (Will Pathfinding))\n- Hide true product nature (Hide: Multi-Will-Economies consequences. Trust Networks. When you're deceitful, it may be very important to some persons and how they would henceforth treat you or interact with you, And crucially: Believe you and find computational verified good candidate to WM what they want (And perhaps some character virtue stuff and not wanting to deal with such persons in general. Not wanting to feed them to screw over others another time))\n- Create false associations (Eat these supplements and compensate for your genetics! (Despite being well-nourished; Almost ALL supplements have effects SOLELY on malnourished subset of the cohort; Including things like protein loading and so on. You synthesize protein. But if you have a defect in being able to synthesize protein well. Then eating large quantities will have an effect. And this is doubly the effect because it is like fat burning: A pathway that is built up with enzymatic and generative cells of the enzymes over time as it is needed. But do a simple study and yes: You will find that protein-under-synthesizing persons will get a slight increase in protein available for muscle growth (Essential acids too. But they are variant across humanity what amino acid is essential or none at all) (You end up with things like: Oh I will buy this chicken meat because I need the protein. Despite thinking about what it means in terms of demanding the killing of birds reared in the manner you imagine. (Me in 2016: Slight protein or body optimization; At the cost of hell conjuring on earth. WHO KNOWS IF IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE? (IT WAS NOT. DELUSIONAL COPING. Rationalizing away something I wanted to do, with some sort of self-importance (That tiny increases in my somatic condition in relation to \"mate-finding\" or VANITY would justify it) and lying about the conditions of the hellscape I demand conjured)) Or later in 2019-2023: DOOM AND DEATH TO EVERYTHING. Including most Animals and everything.)))\n- Prevent real comparison (All things considered: Which is mostly made hyper retarded by having positioned Infrastructure for products and consumers as adversaries and enemies. (That also try to extract as much information as they can from you in order to exploit you. Manipulate you. Politically. Consumer wise. Every which way. Fetishes. And so on.) Whereas: Infrastructure can be HAD by the consumer or Trusted( BUT THEN ACTUALLY TRUSTED! (Trust Networks) Not merely \"Flag Cover Says Denmark Institution\" or \"Says large company like AWS or Google. So why should I!!! Not trust them\") or Trustless ), with real accountability PoP etc. Where they can Trust their information they share with machine is theirs. (Imagine Iron-Man talking to Jarvis constantly but not daring say anything personal to it. It is absolutely insane. Jarvis becomes a menance to Iron-man. Having to constantly think about what he says as there is an AI system observing him. WHEREAS: If you FLIP IT and give ALL THE TRUST TO THEM WHOEVER THEY ARE. But try to FACILITATE IT HAPPENING FOR ANY TRUST NETWORK. Then! They can all become SMARTER and more in tune with their will and how to make it manifest. Which as I said: In the context of this system: Means helping your enemy do this, means you can DISENTANGLE from him. (Metagame of World Dynamics when you can't. MIRA when you can't do Metagame of World Dynamics.))\n\n**Trust Network Alternative**:\n- Actual user experiences shared (But shared not in the shallow sense. But due to the discussion about Jarvis and Jarvis doing the computer-speed guiding of experience information all things consider. In a DEEP sense.)\n- Real outcomes tracked (Real-time not a single test. But continual, always testing or obversing. What is the case. (Of course some things like blood work and other things are with greater interval between tests (But probably blood work will not be needed, because they too, are shallow things, and the implicit learning from \"bad -> better (all things considered)\" accounts for ALSO the things that a blood-test would try to be proxy for or sometimes prove (Like, a pathogen or something))))\n- Externalities visible (This is not \"externalities\" butterfly effect says externalities of anything is everything. But the predictable, sizable impacts of all those things that mattered to you, matter to you or perhaps would matter to you if you knew about them. This is the fun game one has with one's Aiddaemon/Jarvis :P)\n- Honest comparison possible (Comparison almost unnecessary: Because simply WM. It doesn't matter what in relation to other. Because you're busy WM. With WC and WD. You LIVE and MANIFEST. You don't sit around googling with gooey eyes others.)\n\n### Eliminating Market Gatekeepers\n\n**Current Gatekeepers**:\n- Amazon controlling online retail (It is basically one of many many market \"viewpoints\" that all had a tiny slice of some market present. This was annoying for consumer. So they gravitate towards a few that are useful -- this happens with many all at once, but the ones that get more, get better, the ones who land better supplier deals grow more, the ones that have more demanders or users, get more suppliers (all because they all ask for money and so they don't do it everywhere or they have exclusivity clauses to the infrastructure they're supplied upon). Some of these become lucky. They then grow. And with growth, due to their parasitism-to-be-determined eating, they expand and aggressively buy up everything in their way or simply replicate products of trouble others. Then use all the other avenues to position themselves firmly as the sole or one of the few viewpoint into the market. This allows them to have a sort of monopoly angle where they can leech with their Private_VAT to profit without end or any accountability to having added another parasitic burden to the population.)\n- Google controlling discovery (Basically, the market. The Man in the Middle between a person and the market or information to a pretty large extend. As well as owner of the services in which you store much of your information. But you \"Trust Them\" or simply don't have any alternative because all these factors work together to prevent any alternatives to become useful (Many persons using them (what the users care about usually. Which they don't make. They only facilitate and became the facilitator not because they were the better or only ones. But because they used the mechanisms described in these papers across domains of power) and easy enough for consumer to switch to). And that includes governments and states simply being lobbied and have propaganda bubbles erected around them to make law that simply crushes alternatives. And the same happens with intelligence and military too. They too get propaganda bubbles around them. Often from within. That makes them attack or frame things in ways that makes alternatives \"dangerous\" and in need of being \"crushed\" or \"thwarted\" or something.)\n- Banks controlling in-advance-money-flow (Or investment at large (it includes lending money (Investing civilizationally in the person borrowing that his money is the right thing to premature grant grants for)) and it includes usury (investment that the borrowing person will pay interest upon the loan at a slow rate (market stability assumption (bad assumption)) to maximize profits) and things like investment banks who then also do loans to \"industrial endeavours\" (in theory or utopian delusion)), as well as payments (stripe etc), as well as money-supply inflation (Fed and interbanking loans), inflation at large (distribution to which demand base and defaulting of loans on which supply or granting of loans (in-advance-money) to which supplier- or demander-wannabes (Say loan to a energy drink company or loan for a yacht or large wedding))\n- Platforms taking percentages (They all function like this: They see a stratified infrastructure market. That heavily is dependent on the qualities of content and quantity of it. Then they manage to capture essential qualities and quantities to their infrastructure \"content-delivery\". Then the monopoly effect arises. Then they never relinquish or think responsibly or with accountability about their parasitic burden they have then incurred upon the world. Now the oppressive and dominating aspects to how they wield their power while in that position. (Entire Silicon Valley are rich because of this. There have been local versions of everything they've done. Usually before them and usually better than them. But they win because of exactly that mechanism. They use every trick across all domains of power they can to establish themselves as that \"infrastructure\" in the digital for all human interaction with that infrastructure. And these systems replace them 100% (And We ONLY have to AGREE AS NORMAL PEOPLE TO SWITCH ONCE....... To the non-parasitic version. There will be 0 monetary gain had in making these systems and the supplying is internal economically solved. So, it takes the market ONLY ONE TIME to do this \"demand terraforming\" to a new setting. Say in terms of \"carbon\" or \"animal welfare\" or \"human rights\" or whatever else you care about. It will only have to happen ONCE this time. Then after that THEY ARE GONE. And one is ABLE to go without majority or all to have leverage and effect. Then the systematic consequences will unfold that will allow for these things to be terraformed at human will. Instead of gamed positions, property right domination, zero-sum position, lawfare and state bullshit one can't escape and where a few gets to impose massive will without having any REAL leverage or merit to back it up. But rather have simply found themselves in positions to take advantage of it and so they do in the manner befitting to them and their character. Which will have DIRECT consequences and accountability in the system that has to be switched to ONLY ONE TIME. New IT Tech Stack. THEN it is over.)))\n\n**Direct Exchange Enablement**:\n- Producer to consumer directly (prosumer or conducer :P It isn't as one-way in the new system)\n- Discovery through trust networks (Intelligence through it. Largely. Because we don't live in kumbaya world with objective reality all agree upon and everyone being \"rational agents\" and so on.)\n- Payment through chosen systems (\"through\" will-economic ANY DOMAIN and so \"through\" ???? Whatever cross-domain divesting and vesting with acts between that allow for will-equilibrium concerning the matter to be had)\n- No mandatory intermediaries (In fact, intermediaries is also obsolete. Trust Network and Multaiddaemon and Triads are ALL collective systems you need. The rest is You and Your Aiddaemon: Daiddaemon. Going about in a world of million-fold opportunities and richness. (And again................... .Not saying REVOLUTION! I am saying: LET US TRY AT LEAST ONE PLACE. Then I bet my ways will swallow the world. Where your ways will be stubbornly held by a few. With whatever consequences that will have Will-economically speaking.))\n\n### Gift Economies and Hybrid Systems\n\n**Beyond Pure Transaction**:\n- Gift economies build relationships (\"It is my will to please you or take care of you or ... ... \" These sorts of things. \"To be nice to you\". And so on. When it is holistically your will. And you're not necessitated to deal with the established structures of corporations and powers that currently is. But can instead simply be facilitated in whatever WM you have. Then what are they there for? They aren't there for anything at all. They will crumble and fall away. They want efficient economies. They want responsiveness. Okay. Well HERE YOU HAVE IT. Raw WM. Raw WE. Raw WC. That faciliitates \"products\" when they are demanded and with the forethought that the world-will or those that can will (I talked about the ARK project. Instead of doing Mars suvival in kind. Then do some massive ARK project on the planet that functions AS IF we could magically transport humanity to Mars, i.e.: Biodome survival even if earth climate goes totally awry for human survival. (Now, World can will it. And make choices every day towards it, orthogonal to it, or against it. But also \"those that can\" can will it. And simply make it happen. \"You can't make the world do what you want. But you can make what the world will need from doing what they want\" (Then you can call that HYPER LONG TERM investment strategies (WE ownership of ARK upon human-survivability conditions (Not that it will last: Think snowpiercer versus The Passengers and so on. It all depends on so much whether such ideas of Ownership or reality of Pwnership is had))))))\n- Sharing economies reduce waste (efficient economies reduce waste inherently. But the current system is highly inefficient (I have pointed out several reasons why (non-exhaustively pointed things out)). Also: Trust enables many things. Also: Pathfinding reduces or destroys most things that prevent pathfinding... Like regulation. Or Obsolete Systems.)\n- Hybrid trades with currency/money (universal token feel good bananacoins) and cross-domain WC to mutual-WM emerge naturally and with gradient according to the intertrading persons and their ability to find alternative paths towards WM. (Which is highly dependent on things like Trust Network beliefs and personal interlocking against each other; as well as physical reality: Triad Crucible Solution Nesting Sovereignty)\n\n**Trust Enables Gifting**:\n- Know gift will be appreciated (And what does it usually have of consequences to gift someone something then not having it reciprocated or betrayed afterwards: It changes the Will in relation to that other person. Which is then actuable due to \"these systems\".)\n- Understand recipient's needs (Like not feeling Wrong. Like being 5'9\" tall in a world where most men out in the open are 6'3\" and trying to hook up or be peacock-sexually attractive and make others feel inferior constantly. Aka. Will-disentanglement of \"hobbit\" (In any dimension or domain) from those others who are \"giants\" as to enable them to have social or sexual stability without \"invasive species\"; Who may or may not be \"superior\" on account of their \"height\" or \"giantism\" (Your perception of beauty or value or worth. You decide System is amoral (But I suggest MBC planetary and opiniate sometimes: Especially about what is replaced.)))\n- Build long-term reciprocity (This is tit-for-tat across Trust Networks. Which allows snakes-oil salesman to only go for as long as he can avoid the information flow through Trusted Nodes.)\n- Create community wealth (This is in general a thing that this world lacks. Almost all money is \"faux-community\" pooled into \"profit seeking organization\" without any aligning WM vision. Which allows for it to be dispersed into the winds at the whim of those shadowy persons who end up deciding what the actual hoarded wealth should be spent upon. Whether banks or states or insurance or anything else.)\n\n### Critical Market Principles\n\n**No Objective Value**: Everything subjective to the valuer (Ultimately yes)\n**Trust Filters Everything**: Bad actors naturally excluded (And this can very quickly grow massively to immense intelligence service and thus WE adjustments towards some WM. As well as Multaiddaemon and other things facilitating privacy at collective orchestration scales. As well as Trustless gossiping about WC WD etc. (Like normal advertisement of such things work now: Mostly (People don't think about who says what will happen where. They usually simply go with it. Believe it.)))\n**Information Flows Freely**: Collective intelligence emerges (When human will can find will-economic pathways, then it becomes very intelligent looking. When Aiddaemonic pre-simulation allows for scenarios having been tested out preemptively prior to manifestation. When massive convergence of acts to happen build and become. Then it seems massively intelligent. When intent and manifestation become coupled. When redundancy is had on REAL lines of human and physical constraints instead of imaginary economic happenstance. Then it will seem VERY intelligent.)\n**Multiple Currencies Welcome**: Value expressed many ways (You're free to make your own tokens or currencies. It feels nice to have a metric and some act you can do for others that grants you some measurable accumulation. As an example Strata and PoP PoUWitness and more will have such token accumulation. Also many LLL games will have the former as a foundation to playing the games as well as internal game tokens. And Trust Networking and many many other things could have such tokens as well. Some measurable sensation. Like some Trust Network establishes their internal token or currency to book-keep indebtedness (\"Aiddaemon. Spin up a Multaiddaemon for these PoP that will become this currency-sharing Trust Network/Graph. Whenever we have tasks to do. Like some intelligence work or ensuring of some things to allow for answering a question we want. We use this internally to bookkeep. So, make that visible in whenever I go into that mode\" (Or something like it.)) But again, you don't need it, you can have it all exist latently in the background of your general Will and not book keep things like that: Or if you do, in more will-economic manner. Then simply focus on WM. Or building an awesome Triad that others you would want would want to rally to. Then all this indebtedness isn't that important. With the Triads you get control to say \"banish\" persons or whatever other Sovereign control that states now have. And, so to have substratum rally and come and really invest in your triad. Some guarantees often need to be had: Like not going empty handed therefrom. And the way this works is often by the nesting structure and the sovereign you rally under is subsovereign or subject to another while being superject still. Then, disagreement on those lines are met with the above. That is ultimately: the system can handle most of these things, merely by will-economy, PoP, Trust Network and the consequences of having the leverage of massive world-will against them. So, if one treats another really poorly: It has consequences. It isn't a problem with Triads being problems like that: Because current wealth is puny and Triads are small surrounded by Sea or Ocean Triads which are much more open and can allow for new smaller Triads to be made within , insofar it matches the Routing or Vision of that Triad and its Sovereign (Person or system-as-sovereign))\n**Direct Exchange Preferred**: Intermediaries must add value (Intermediaries that isn't a direct part to the act: Are unneccesary and will be obsolete. That is all third-party profitting will go away from acts. There will not be a wedge to substract wealth from it. (Other than PoU Strata). But, are you part to the pathfinding of \"vegan-burrito in sofa now!!!!\" Then of course that's an intermediary but part to the act of \"vegan-burrito in sofa now!!!!\" (NOOOO!!! HE SAID VEGAN! THAT IS CRINGE OTHER TRIBE SOY BOYS! I NEED TO BE STRONG MAN! AND KILL INNOCENT ANIMALS IN HELLSCAPE CONJURED CONDITIONS!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! (Sorta like that I was xD (Joking. But not really. RAWWWRRR DEATH AND DOOM TO THE WORLD!!! Strong Man! CAN AT LEAST DESTROY WHEN HE CAN'T FIX.))))\n\n### The Abundant Market Future\n\nWhen markets reach trust maturity:\n- Every exchange creates mutual benefit (In massive degree. Across many domains at once. Across many different timescales at once. Towards many different Will/Intents of each person partaking in the \"high density will-Economies\")\n- Deception becomes impossible\n- Value flows to real utility\n- Innovation rewards increase\n- VISION and DREAMING MINDSET PREVAILS. Dream World Manifest!\n\nNot through regulation but through visibility or the many things made opaque all at once. Not through standardization but through diversity and experimentation: Real world manifestation and each and every person own individual attitude towards these things that then has become. Not through control but through free choice informed by trust. (Unless Triad Crucible. And yes you can TRY Polymorphic Crucible WITHOUT the territorial nesting dynamics. But then you only get one-shot at the governance structure and have to rely it all on the other parts to the system. Say, you may be inclined to state: One massive Planetary or World or Ocean structure that has these and those rules. But then otherwise all within is free-roam and only functioning on the other parts to the system. No sovereigns or anything else. And while this is okay. Perhaps you will find it necessary to state hardlines of owning some space on the planet to have it YOUR WILL without any other will against you. Exactly your vision. Exactly you dream. For most persons: Having your dream or vision is about WC and WD. Which can be had by one Ocean rule: If you actively try to ruin WD effects then you're banished from the zone. But otherwise \"dream on\". That causes a massive zone where \"your will and your dream\" is WC in spacetime when it can. But no territorial binding at all or building of a space as \"yours exclusively\" or \"your land\" or \"your/someone-particular sovereignty\". But again, all of these alternatives are merely that: Alternatives. And World-will, YOUR WILL or Will-Economics will have it be what it will be. We shall see. All I ask for .........)\n\nThe market becomes a space where:\n- Your grandmother's cookies find their true valuers\n- Artisans connect with those who appreciate craft\n- Healers meet those needing their specific gift\n- Everyone finds their economic resonance\n\nThis is economics returning to its root: the management of home/dominum, the care of community, the facilitation of human flourishing through exchange. The management of order within a Dominum (Triad).\n\n---\n\n*For foundational concepts, see [Trust Networks](../20%20trust_network_dynamics.md) and [Proof of Utility](../24%20nss.md).

Civilizational Emergence\n\n## Trust Divergence and the Natural Formation of Civilizations\n\n### The End of Forced Unity\n\n**Current Reality**: One-size-fits-all civilization\n- Single legal system imposed on all\n- Unified \"values\" that satisfy none\n- Minorities (and majorities by other minorities) perpetually dominated; \n- Compromise creating universal mediocrity; No one gets to plan out something well for the long-term. Neverending new compromise.\n- Unable to find the opportunities that would allow for going free from what torments one. No place to disentangle one-self from the unnacceptable conditions one perceives. Whoever dominates you or whatever system artifact or rigidity that does it. A way out of the potential of the guns coming \"justified\" and with everyone applauding. To break their golden position of being \"justified\" in using might.\n\n**Natural Reality**: Multiple civilizations emerging\n- Groups coalesce around shared values\n- Trust maps diverge naturally (trust-the-information-communication break-down. Which is foundation for everything. In a world that becomes so intelligent as envisioned; then the core-belief about the information-flows become essentially foundation of everything. (A normal person or anyone can not having total eyes on everything all at once with perfect chain of custody information))\n- Incompatible values separate peacefully\n- Each civilization finds its truth\n- Movement between them possible\n\n### Trust Map Divergence\n\n**How Civilizations Separate**:\n1. Person disagree about fundamental utility\n2. Different persons view it differently: will-path/WE beliefs for same actors diverge\n3. Information flows preferentially within Trust Networks who diverge on account of partiality; Which in turn is viewed as untrustworthiness by the other partialities. The impartial unwitnessing might then investigate and fall on a side. Or stay in stasis concerning the matter. Unsettled.\n4. Economic activity clusters\n5. Distinct civilizations emerge\n\n**Example Divergence**:\n- Group A values \"individual freedom absolutely\" (Which is a lie. Almost always. Or if it isn't a lie, then it is a matter of whether they are stronger than others or not. They want Freedom within limits of something. Sometimes almost all high tension filled will-against-will action like NAP. Where will-against-will is solved by forcing persons to play within certain games and be totally without recourse in other domains of reality. (You can trick a person into bankruptcy and take his house. Or do it more honourable ways then. NAP-approved. But spitting on another is NAP-violating.) Sometimes less extreme. But it all stems from this Freedom connumdrum of stating \"free from others who say I can't\" \"free to do what I want\". Well what if what you want is preventing others from doing what they want? Or your will is to directly prevent them because their will is changing something you don't want changed (transformed or whatever). This is why IF WM with WE view can't do WD sufficiently THEN Triads is a hard-line solution: At least there will be a place on the planet to go free from it. And it also serves as places of permanence and longer-lasting story telling without the feedback dynamism of the other parts to the system. (Triad feedback is rally effects; Substratum of whos).)\n- Group B values collective harmony (This the freedom absolutely also value usually. But they see collective impositions as usually being the root of why there isn't harmony in many places.)\n- They systematically disagree about \"utility\"\n- Trusts maps can diverge over time (sometimes they can stay by \"outstanding characters shared between them\"); But what usually happens is WD effects.\n- Two civilizations naturally form\n\n### Aesthetic Stratification\n\n**Beyond Kant's Universal Beauty**:\n\nKant assumed shared faculties of cognition \u2192 too much universality in man; including our perceptions of anything necessarily having to be beautiful.\n\nReality shows:\n- Some find chaos beautiful\n- Others find order beautiful\n- Some resonate with destruction\n- Others with creation\n- These aren't aberrations but different foundations\n\n**Beauty Is Subjective** (not universal):\n- But we can make a new name of those beings that have strong alignment in sense of some property: Metroversal. As to suggest the \"universals of the microcosm of a metropolis\" or \"alma/ex mater\" or \"breastfed/out-of mother\" (metro from greek m\u1e17t\u0113r (\"mother\")). Then depending on the type of property in question, then often different scales of interest apply. Say, the sense of beauty, may be important at the scale of civilization. To rise with a vision of beauty in mind and work towards that. Where the sense \"what makes a homely comfortable or good every day life\" may not be very appropriate to state at a civilizational scale. (Or at least if you do, it may end up having derallying effects or WE against that place in terms of pathfinding WM for very many persons who otherwise would fit well.)\n(Other examples could be things like public sexual and sexual morality. Which is highly upsetting between humans, very often. Along these lines, it is then also, very conducive to consider things like civilization. In the end: You have to listen to your emotions and your will. Your intent. Your dreams and visions. And if you don't want to do it at civilizational scale: Then at least at a homely scale. Or perhaps in an adventurous spacetime living of emergent coalescence of what you want as you travel or live in place to place. And so on.)\n- Alien between civilizations\n- Each coherent in its own terms\n- None objectively \"correct\"\n\n### Daemonia as Resonance Spaces\nA place where daemons who are willing to state shared Daemon in some fundamental or important sense. Or complementary in some harmonious manner (including oxymoronic harmony (The wanting of cacophony becoming harmonious in its fulfilment to those who want the cacophony)).\n\n**Types of Daemonic Clustering**:\n\n**Fountain** (single Daemon exclusivity to preserve a single type in having a place on earth what ever that may be):\n\n**Springs** (tight homogeneous Daemon or very harmonious complementary Daemons):\n- Any Domain Dominant metroversals \n- High internal coherence\n- Clear boundaries\n- Intense resonance\n\n**Rivers** (fluid cooperation; fundamentally aligned Daemons sharing some delieneated space for them and them alone: Their house by the noumenally naming of their daemons):\n- Few compatible metroversal disputes or divergences. Most is aligned or harmonious by complementary default.\n- Dynamic flow between them\n- Flexible boundaries\n- Moderate resonance\n\n**Lakes** (much less focus on Daemons and simply having a sense of decently aligned daemons; not constantly working against each other. Most of the time and act working with each other. Perhaps even almost all the time.):\n- Multiple metroversals coexisting, in a more turbulent and swirling intermingling manner.\n- Complex negotiations\n- Permeable boundaries\n- Varied resonance\n\n**Seas** (culturally founded civilization-scale):\n- Metroversal coherence on important parts. Perhaps especially: Aesthetic metacoherence\n- Shared deep patterns\n- Natural borders\n- Harmonic resonance\n- It is reasonable to expect Sovereignties or single persons being lauded leaders at this level. But don't expect much of that at larger scales.\n\n**Oceans** (civilizational binding of seas. A civilization of more than one sea.):\n- Many deep and important metroversal differences. Perhaps much about aesthetics; but still some unifying across the seas core of daemonic overlap without demonic difference, to one another that would create too much tension and conflict. Often these things are had on sexual lines. Or sacred lines. Sometimes personality custom lines \"The way this group of other daemons simply are and act and behave\".\n- Negotiation with appeal to shared beliefs or metroversals or Daemonic proclamations of the civilization.\n\n**Worlds** (Total pragma. Like global trade but the future of it: Actuality. The space of interaction reachable. \"Act Event Horizon\"-ishish):\n- Interface protocols only\n- No shared aesthetics beyond mostly what is unacceptably ugly or disruptive or destructive. Say, Rape. Or whatever it may be.\n- Pure negotiation\n- Minimal resonance\n\n**Planetary** (The Governance We are Willing to Impose unto and Dominate all others with. The inviolable \"rights\" or \"laws\"):\n- This is the root-drive of the earth. Whatever we can agree to dominate the world with. Whatever minimal codex we can find. This is where it sits. And we use it as the Planetary law and help each other enforce it across the globe.\n- Nothing is expected to be overlapping in this domain. It is merely finding the maximal set of absolutely unacceptable things that can be agreed upon: thus minimizing it. It becomes the maximal minimal codex. (It is PLANETARY. So it takes Every Single Person Real-Time Agreeing Upon It. (Mechanics of stability is the typical consequences of against-will: In this case World-will))\n\n### The Problem of Liberal Universalism\n\n**Liberalism's Hidden Tyranny**:\n- Claims no universal values\n- But universally imposes valuelessness by often disallowing the asserting - in space - of any value. It seems no public square in the liberal mind be dominated as a thing. Say: \"Burka must be worn here\".\n- \"Tolerance\" becomes mandatory; and a grevious moral crime to be intolerant, worse still, the most dangerous upheaval to suggest intolerance at the state or \"domination in space\" level.\n- Particular beauty forbidden to remain unpollutted or disentangled. Whatever can find its way, will have its way.\n- The Tasteless Man as political ideal; Whereas there exists similar tendencies for art, where the superficial or instinctual aspects are totally side-stepped for the abstractive viewing from all angles and never having an assertive taste, but rather gentle touching each and moving on. Never settling upon any. Not daring to fully be opinionated in favour of the superficial or instinctual ever, perhaps?\n\n**Its Self-Defeating Nature**:\n- Forces all to accept all\n- Prevents natural sorting; by morally condemning expression of will to disentangle or go free from others imposition: Thy shall tolerate.\n- Creates universal dissatisfaction; no one gets to have that WC and WD high-density life and world. Or, rarely they do, mostly they get it by few events once in a while, that \"sorta also have the elements that make it great\". (Often , the persons who thrive in WC in modern world are the ones who do not have strong WD needs. Where, the massive festival isn't ruined by the presence of ... and ... and .. and also .. other kinds of persons and the way they are. What is certain is this though: It is rare events and often expensive having to pay. Instead of side-effect of WM that through WE actualization causes WC and WD)\n- Destroys distinct beauty; As do any entropic philosophy, unless IRON WILL/Instinct against the entropy can somehow survive its entropic force and framework. \n- Replaces diversity with gray\n\n### Natural Civilizational Properties\n\n**Internal Coherence**:\n- Shared trust networks (At the very least some persons (PoP) will rise as the bridging or overarching gap that has a coherency effect on beliefs, truths or facts of the civilization; Without that, much becomes a lot harder. This is why Trust Networks are an quintessential fabric of a civilization and how its disappearence can cause fragmentation of a civilization.)\n- Common aesthetic sense (This is again: Imagine what you find absolute beautiful is absolute hideousness to others. Or what is most sacred to you is indiscriminate material to others. These things makes it hard to have a civilization together. The very fundamentals of what is valuable and worthwhile. Beautiful to strive towards. Or be. Is in dispute. And so therefore Aesthestics is another quintessential foundation of Civilization.)\n- Aligned moral intuitions (Good and Evil. And the above parenthesis.)\n- Compatible life rhythms or let's simply say WM bedrock interweavability or coalescensability.\n- Mutually reinforcing values; This is highly beneficial. The Oughts aligned. Then the how-to is a matter of not having too many persons not interested in finding best solutions; but something else.\n\n**External Interfaces**:\n- Trade protocols: How to keep Sea-Will or Ocean-Will coherent and harmonious while doing external trading. How to make Trading not Traitorous: High WD or high cost in WE terms towards others: Perhaps wanting to Metagame World Dynamics and total actuality-insulation; perhaps MIRA; or even unacceptable MIRA (To Dominate them at all costs if unsure of their technological or power pursuit). This becomes a question of what? Old way is governance and some persons making a choice. Triad way is similar but then having tools to see what the population changes WE about such choices. Perhaps they part for another place better insulated. And New without Triad control way is simply progressive disentanglement and divergence from each other. Cutting transitive links away if willing to: Otherwise gradient leveraging or cost-incurment.\n- Peace agreements. Which means what? Some sort of threshold step interrelation of animae with animae to cease some sort of belligerence or hostility in act. Then, perhaps letting it stay in stasis for another time; or perhaps finding another way to solve it, once \"cease-fire\" or \"peace\" is made -- perhaps difference is \"initial intent of having come to terms sufficiently\" degree.\n- Movement allowances (Which can easily be done a person to person basis and spacetime in relation to the interfacing particular persons. Instead of having to have a homogenous agreement. Or let's say: It is easier to avoid have strong disagreement when you can easily provide \"pathway to explore another world that respects WD (higher WE encoded) and provides better WC (wanting to have the company of those persons and one's belief of them for some WM aspect or act) Again... Crucible Triadic structure is what makes it hardline dissent and ensuring a place on earth by protocol instead of WE leverage work: But in reality you could forego the Crucible entirely if sufficiently powerful leverage work functionally allowing for what good The Crucible allows. I prefer it as simply Governance/Spatial-ownership-long-lasting application. Then it is raw rally dynamics, and not WE in its holistic that decides it. It is perhaps failing to apply the lessons of much of the writing, but, it is simply what I can't let go as a rules: MBC and \"at least one place on the planet no matter what where you can be Sovereign. Truly.\" then a system for that... That fits the well enough... Being natural selection of rally and superjective sovereignty nesting and the WE manifestation of it. Whatever. I suggest it. As stability. Then perhaps one day it will not be necessary. But a pattern to project if someone can't find a way to be without others and dearly love something and want to make of that small place on earth something that is theirs' and their's alone. Zero-sum game of territory. Freed for anyone. No matter what. No matter will of anyone else. Mercy in some place and be as free as they want (below Planetary (MBC suggested)). To be hated by all to no end, or feeling all places absolute hell, but able to find solace and a place on the planet still. Then on top of that: I guess I also simply like the experimentation of the old ways... Instead of the fluidity of WM actualization. Then clear cut ideation and philosophies/politics to \"try out and live\" to prove or not what you wanted to about them. Whereas, in the fluidity version, then it becomes exactly that: fluid whether it is or not. And transaction/equilibrium WE agreements with massive WC and WD effects making most WE hyper-positive-summed instead of zero-sum transaction. So. Also I like the clear cut permanence of places that can provide stasis and enchanting sensation: story telling that lasts or stretched back a long time. Despite being hated by many trying to ruin it... ... WM of course allows for this: To have WC so long as it is possible. And so on. To see WE effects of WM to replace it by those stubbornly there. And with Triad, sorta the same thing: But not a lot of territorial control. The power of the state not there. You'd have whatever Triadic ruleset above everywhere, but no ability to make Triad at that lower level. So, again: I imagine smaller scale Triads of springs and rivers, being smalle territorial scales. Lakes being cities. Then most territory sea or perhaps even better ocean or even World lands. (Say, I would like to make most of The West Open-Roam but where all dangerous elements are removed. This would be nice super-structure. Then below that Ocean of familiarity. Which will probably be along racial lines. Say, purely White white world Ocean. And so on. This is where much of Power is pooled into. The abstraction that \"has leverage\" and \"can do things\"). Is it necessary? I believe it will be very hard to do without it. I do not believe these systems sufficient other than de facto total transitivity cutting of all between racial lines by very many... Don't ask me why men between races hate each other. Don't tell me why I grew up and have throughout my life been subject to \"strong emotion against the world of them there\" -- You can judge me all you want. But it is what it is. I do not want to have to spend a second with men I don't want to. And barely with women I don't want to. And most men of other races I do not want to spend time with at all. I simply want to be left alone. You can call me whatever you want. This is how I feel. For whatever reason.. If I could WD in actuality from all. Then still, I would be locked by government domination on me. So without at least a new Triad it is unaccetable to me. With a Triad where I sovereign enough to not being dominated and lose it all. Then, I can deal with having to leverage my way into WD space of not having to deal with persons I don't want to: Men in particular. (I am viscerally disgusted by the thought of having to spend time or more time with men I don't want to). Anyway: Triads are a massive upgrade to Governance. And if at some point it turns out almost all prefers Ocean or World or Planetary anarchy but with good WM mechanics. Then let that scale. While the Triads of much more strict aspects be what they will be. It is a big world. Let's not get cut up in \"non-loss\" and \"governance\" positions at smaller scale. This was very ranty. Oh well. TL;DR: Even if you can see how Triads might become unnecessary: They are bastion of defense and having expression on the planet. As well as providing human-law-encoded subordination and order. Instead of it only being emergent by market will-economic market natural selection stuff. And they allow for fun enough things in terms of story telling and rich world. \"knowing of places\" instead of it all being will-spacetime fluid) ( I could be angry and vengeanceful about it all. But if I can merely be left alone and forge my own destiny. Disentangled from those I wish to be free from. Then that's enough. I simply want to go free. This is the tools to let anyone go free and be massively empowered in manifesting their will. Regurgitation overload.)\n- Information exchange\n- Minimal forced interaction (Planetary law. MIRA style justified breaking of disentanglement dynamics. Perhaps force persons into Metagame of World Dynamics. To gamify it: \"You could do warfare, with Non-lethal weaponry. Then have dying persons be transported away to dead-man lobby-land. Then when you're out of men. You designate a winner who then takes it. But where their men and machinery is by then destroyed. But with no or very few real humans dead\". Or you could do some Troy like setting or chess or whatever you want. But simply: Force them into doing some sort of settling of the might-confrontation without WMDs. Or similarly hundreds of thousands or millions of men having to die.)\n\n### High-Leverage Civilizational Shaping\n\n**How Influential Actors (Old world money / new world influential actors is mostly by quality of what they can provide) Create Attractors**:\n\n**Example: Aesthetic Patron**\n- Billionaire funds \"microcosm\" or \"infrastructure scale that makes certain things easy and cheap and other not\" or makes a Triad or helps facilitate a Triad. Perhaps they need building materials. Perhaps .. ... They fund The Crucible meta-facilitation of Triads, to switch into a stable point to work from. Perhaps they fund the tech-stack development: Trust Maps and Chains of Trust in all the system allows for Jarvis instead of Echelon/Skynet/Siri or whatever.\n- Creates WM grounds conducive. It becomes WE cheaper to WM. Then tech stack of WE visiualization and intelligence lacking. But. Still. It is a stepping stone. To have some material transformations that make it possible to have WC happen at all: At the very least subsistence made easy anywhere: Hackney Shelther, Food, Water and Sickness Treatment/Extraction protocols and financing. Then once the system is in place. Probably will not be needed much of this. As pathfinding actualization is more than sufficient for it. \"World-will\" (Some group of persons are starving or sleeping in the cold hopelessly broken, consequence? ... \"Slight perturbation of acts that is predicted to fulfill WC/WM it into not being a problem\". It can be as simple as this: \"I took the bike this morning instead of the robotaxi/train/car\" or \"I bought this food item instead of that one, though they seem identical to me, from a guy who was deemed high WM probability to fix it locally if he had funds\" or \"I interacted with this person instead of THAT person who then chose to interact there instead and .. .. chain of things .. .. shelther, food, water provided or better yet: finding their place they thrive\" and so on. It isn't scary btw. It is reality of our actions: Butterfly effects we stay blissfully ignorant to. But could be made predictable pathway perturbations such that one actively chooses some WC actions across the networks that makes it all with high probability fall into place: Consider it a sort of harder travelling's salesman problem, but one where human will decide its intractibility or extreme ease to find such pathways.) \n- Artists congregate. It will be interesting to see that unknown unknown becoming known known sensation of: \"Oh my lord. Yes. This... This was EXACTLY what I've been missing. I simply didn't know it was a thing. But being in it...\". Then having it be simply a WE matter. Is it possible to WC sufficiently (WD): WM that unknown unknown sensations. Or perhaps known unknown (You know that you don't know it, there is a thing you know is there, but it is unknown to you) or unknown known (There is a thing you will love and like, but you don't know that you know it. It is something, that you know \"by extension\" but don't know that you know yet.)\nI say this because of Horizons: Keeping one's head up. Despite feeling it all dark. To have massive optimism in known unknown or better yet: unknown unknown. The many many stories and lives that could be lived by creativity and imagination you simply haven't had yet. Totally unknown to you. ( I some sense by saying this I try to bundle it all into known unknown for you: Believe sufficient to know that there is a lot of unknown horizons to life in the future)\n- Aesthetic civilization emerges: Distinction. Richness. Plurality. Variety. From Order to Chaos. Homogeneity to Heterogeneity. Diversity in a better Sense of the Word. Hyperpolyversity of the world. Whatever \n- Self-sustaining culture forms (Culture that is ground-up. Not top-down safari or imposed. Culture that is LIVED FIRST. Willed. Animated or besouled.)\n\n**Negative Space Creation**:\n- Refusing certain practices\n- Economic dead zones form\n- Incompatible groups avoid\n- Natural boundaries emerge\n- Peaceful separation achieved\n\n### The Crucible Model: Practical Implementation\n\n**The Choice Architecture**:\n1. **Old World**: Current nation-states and international order\n2. **Crucible World**: Voluntary sovereignty zones emerging\n\n**Zone Structure Example**:\n```\n2#38128: Sovereign's zone implementing 123404321\n  \u2514\u2500 2#38128#237: Nested zone with additional rules\n      \u2514\u2500 2#38128#237#15: Further fractal nesting\n```\n\n**Key Principles**:\n- **Inherit and Add**: Each level inherits laws from above, can add but not subtract\n- **Fork and Branch**: Sovereigns can split interpretations (e.g., 1230321 vs exploring principle 4)\n- **Rally or Leave**: Citizens vote with feet, not ballots\n- **Bubble Up**: Denied requests can escalate to higher sovereigns, testing submission/subordination. (You can do system-as-sovereign. similarly to states of modern day world. But i highly advice against it. Do real PoP accountability and sovereignty nesting. Then also use that as incentive to be your own sovereign. Start small, and ifyou make something great an awesome place/Triad, then see rallying dynamics kick in and eating of some more surrounding Sea/Ocean.)\n\n\n**Physical Manifestation**:\nInitial emergence in:\n- If nothing else: Then perhaps allowed, though then in need of a starter WC in terms of materials: Unclaimed territories (Sahara, Antarctica, oceans)\n- Failed states willing to experiment\n- Special economic zones\n- Distributed enclaves connected by sovereignty not geography\n\n**The Might is Right Alliance (MIRA)**:\nFramework for peaceful coexistence of opposing sovereignties:\n- \"If I trust your supremacy won't be utter hell, I accept your island forging its destiny\"\n- Enemies can grant each other \"hilltops of merit\" after conflict. (This ensures despite different castles and not coming first or winning. Then still allowed a \"good position\" on account of \"might/magic progressions\".)\n- Strength diversity preserved across network\n- Honor across incompatible worldviews\n\n### Movement Between Civilizations\n\n**Individual Journey**:\n- Start in birth civilization\n- Feel aesthetic dissonance\n- Discover other options\n- Test compatibility\n- Migrate if resonant\n- If other parts of the systems are live. Or attempts at bringing them live. Then \"getting pathrealization for manifestation\" guiding is useful. Where would \"suit\" me. Which Triad. Or World, Ocean, Sea... Nice entry point. Nice embedding for the rest of the systems.\n\n**Trust Bridges**:\n- Some maintain connections across\n- Enable limited exchange\n- Prevent total isolation\n- Allow information flow; Never think categorically. Always think contextually. \"Information Flow. Some definitely disallowed. Perhaps good to have some flow and trusted 'outstanding characters' across civilizations. Ultimately, the world fate may dependent upon it, in terms like MIRA\"\n- Keep peace possible\n\n### Conflict as Topology\n\n**Not War But Geography**:\n- Conflicts create distance\n- Incompatibility increases separation\n- Natural boundaries strengthen\n- Topology complexifies\n- Navigation becomes important (Imagine going from absolute evil to absolute good from walking 10 meters...)\n\n**Creative Tension**:\n- Differences inspire innovation\n- Competition between systems\n- Natural selection of civilizations\n- Evolution through diversity\n- Progress through plurality\n\n### Post-Kantian Moral Architecture\n\n**Each Civilization's Categorical Imperative**:\n\"Act only according to that maxim which you can will as universal law... *for your civilization*\"\n\n**Examples**:\n- Warrior civilization: Honor above losses (keep your lives..)\n- Merchant civilization: Profitteering seeking is fun (But exit avenue. Not all the world. Many fail that world. Suffer and die from the fun-time of seeking profits. You should WANT to know or provide alternatives or options as a market man? No?)\n- Artist civilization: Beauty justifies all efforts\n- Scholar civilization: Truth at any personal cost\n- Each coherent internally\n\n### Simulation Before Convergence\n\n**Testing Compatibility**:\n- Simulate joining civilization (Both VR but also without human attention. Or simply try, believe the system you use to find paths and try it out. Or try to WC a new place)\n- Experience aesthetic/moral framework\n- Test resonance safely\n- Decide with full knowledge\n- Prevent costly mistakes\n\n**Collective Simulation**:\n- Groups test merger\n- Incompatibilities revealed\n- Peaceful separation chosen\n- Conflict prevented\n- Wisdom preserved\n\n### The End of Politics\n\n**Current Politics**: Fighting for control of single system\n**Civilizational Future**: Each group builds their own\n\n**No Need For**:\n- Elections (join compatible civilization; It is all about your will. YOu can embed whatever you want xD So if you like the voting sensation thrill whatever: be my guest xD But you're not preventing all other ways (superior ways) xD)\n- Legislation (emergent from values; If Triad nesting good. Then WE's are enough for WC WD dynamics to let you avoid scenarios where law or legislation is necessary (For many types of creatures. But, again, not all \"Carve out a safe home\" And yes, especially in third world countries. Like suburbs of Johannesburg or Praetoria. The shed cities and so on. Don't accept it. Hardline Triad Power: Borders and Banishment. (In general MBC allows for physical removal and even beatings and so on; We shall see what becomes of the world. And what Planetary Law there will be.)))\n- Enforcement (trust consequences and general WE all the way to Triad physical power use: Horns)\n- Compromise (separate instead)\n- Domination (build your own: Big World. Plural Diverse World to Come.)\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n**Exit Rights Sacred**: Must be able to leave\n**Information Flow**: Learn about options; At least known unknown of more than that world. And some sort of choices. \"Provide alternatives for those wanting to explore out. Where they can go and live, but still come home, not being totally dishonoured or alienated having indulged in all you hate and profaned all you love\".\nThat is to say: known unknown of more than the Triadic Nesting horizon they inhabit and can see; they can leave for it any time they want. Then I suggest, offer some visibility points of \"that towards they yearn for\" but where it isn't a sense of total alienation and betrayal to have them enjoy that yearning or whatever.\nIt isn't a right to informed about every other thing on the planet. \"Did you know that some guy could by now have made your wife cum twice\" while you have sex with her. Okay? It isn't \"good to maximize information\" constantly. In fact, being able to be insulated from information is the only way to not go crazy and to be happy. And to have \"the ugly be happy\" or \"the dwarfes\". That they can have some sort of life where they are not constantly subject to a sense of information about their supposed \"inferiority\". But it could be anything. It could be annoying talking points or wanting to debate or whatever else. You don't have a right to have your voice heard across the globe. Others can will against your voicing everywhere.\n**Economic Viability**: Each civilization without being sustainable would find it hard to guarantee attractive position. \n**Peace Protocols**: Interaction rules clear\n**Diversity Celebrated**: Global Distinctions or Differences as strength or \"A Rich World That If Made Safe and Beautiful in all the ways that a human mind can fathom beauty variantly: Then a world worth exploring\".\n\n### The Pluriversal Future\n\nWhen civilizational emergence matures:\n- Thousands of experiments in living\n- Each finding their perfect expression or their dream-world history writing\n- Natural selection without violence; nor death. But \"as if\"-out-of-actuality, out of spacetime, out of space, or out of ..; or in general terms without degree: disentanglement and divergence.\n- Diversity beyond imagination\n- Human potential unleashed with conflict \"optimized\".\n\nNot through wishful assertion of what the solution is or what humans should do.\nLike stating humans simply need to [insert repression or \"new way they ought to be\"]; But instead allowing them to be what they are AND want to be.\nThen because of that, disorder, hurt and pain by the other so affronting and abrasive; Then because of that many will simply choose ways in which to avoid each other. But the landscape has to be visible. It is not as it stands and most are locked into zones of domination; where they have no power over anything and are bound to their position and debt and responsibilities in ways such that their hands are tied into submission and acceptence of whatever the world happens to throw at them. With the outlet of \"voting once ever twice or fourth year\".\n\nIt is thus expected that virtue like Tolerance, because one of scale. To Tolerace globally your polarities; that is virtuous still. But to tolerate others who cause suffering to you or those around you. Or wills so very differently that all around you is obstacles and temptations pulling you away from what you want and will. Well... It is a vice at that scale. Intolerance is the virtue at that scale. And a lot of it the closer you get. Dare to say at least somewhere on planet there shall be a state of ONLY what I really want; I want that as an option always in spacetime (somewhere on the planet at any time).\n\nSo, you may say that the mature civilization state becomes one where unity is had by separation and local intolerance but unifying aspects that allows for them to come together despite - perhaps even in spite - of it.\nInstead of tolerance (repression), then think in terms of creation. To build a space or place also for those. That is how you can be altruistic or loving, without asking others to repress their emotions and will.\nTherefore, Not through tolerance but through separation. Not through compromise but through clarity. \n\nThe question of whether something is ubiquitous or universal in some microcosm; is dependent on the reality of diversity along those lines. If there is not a lot of diversity along some aspect to it, Then: \"Universals\" can be had.\nOtherwise, it is particular aspects and plurality.\n\n\nAlas, so the aesthetic fascists build their ordered realm.\nThe anarchistic artists create their chaos. \nThe harmonious collectivists merge in unity.\nThe radical individualists scatter in freedom.\nEach judges the others insane.\nAll correct in their own perspective; but having to face the universe and **its** universals; To which the different perspective and persons may - or may not - capture or grasp parts of -- We shall see what becomes of each and what they have grasped that others' missed. None forced to live in others' worlds or with others. In fact, it becomes the decentralized economized and ubiquity-sovereignty intricate and dynamic discovery of putting the jigsaw puzzle pieces together such that each person can achieve as much as possible of what they want and be presented with a plurality/richness in the world with real opportunity making it real alternatives to embark upon.\n\nThis is Zarathustra's prophecy fulfilled - not one \u00dcbermensch but thousands of civilizations each transcending in their own direction. The death of universal god spawning infinite particular gods. The will to power revealed as will to will - be what you are, and with others become of the world and yourself that which is shared in your nature; ascending or descending -- whatever you feel like and which is manifestable (especially in terms of other human will).\n\nPandora's Box opened reveals not chaos but sorting - each finding their kind, building their world, living their truth. The doom cherished is the death of forced unity. The birth celebrated is authentic diversity.\n\n---\n\n*For philosophical foundations, see [Will Manifestation Philosophy](../15%20will_manifestation_philosophy.md) and [Daemonic Architecture](../16%20daemonic_architecture.md).

Virtual Reality**:\n- Will manifesting without constraint\n- Pure ideation space\n- Impossible made possible\n- Freedom absolute\n\n### The Eternal Return as Design\n\nNietzsche's eternal return becomes system architecture:\n- Blockchain records actions eternally\n- Trust consequences return through networks\n- Successful patterns replicate\n- Would you will this action infinitely?\n\nNot as curse but as ethical guide - actions that you'd gladly repeat forever are actions worth taking.\n\n### Higher-Order Consent and the Ship of Sovereignty\n\n**Two Levels of Consent**:\n\n**Higher-Order Consent**: The choice to board a ship (join a sovereignty)\n- Choosing which zone/civilization to inhabit\n- Accepting the captain's authority for the voyage\n- Retaining absolute exit rights\n\n**Immediate Consent**: What happens during the voyage\n- Captain may order against immediate will\n- Storms may batter despite preferences  \n- Course corrections without consultation\n- All accepted by boarding choice\n\n**The Transformation**:\nThis isn't abandoning consent but elevating it. Instead of:\n- Veto power over every moment\n- Constant negotiation of terms\n- Paralysis through disagreement\n\nWe get:\n- Conscious choice of life context\n- Full commitment within chosen frame\n- Easy exit to different contexts\n- Thousands of ships to choose from\n\n**Crucible Implementation**:\nThe system creates a **marketplace of sovereignties** where:\n- Each offers different terms (laws/culture/aesthetics)\n- You choose by joining (not voting)\n- Success measured by who rallies\n- Failure leads to abandonment\n- Natural selection of governance\n\nThis transforms politics from \"lesser evil voting\" to \"greater good choosing\" - you don't vote for compromise, you move to coherence.\n\n### The New Human Condition\n\nWe become:\n- **Physical beings** grounded in bodies\n- **Augmented beings** navigating enriched reality\n- **Virtual beings** exploring pure will-space\n- **Integrated beings** flowing between realms\n\nNot escaping reality but expanding it. Not denying will but empowering it. Not seeking happiness but enabling authentic pursuit.\n\n### The Ultimate Recursion\n\nThe deepest philosophical insight: The system uses itself to build itself. Will creates infrastructure for will. Consciousness builds tools for consciousness. The universe discovering its own nature through our experiments.\n\nThis is why every mechanism applies recursively:\n- Trust systems use trust\n- Discovery systems use discovery  \n- Will manifestation manifests will\n- The system IS what it DOES\n\n### Philosophical Completion\n\nThis system completes the philosophical project:\n- Schopenhauer's will gains eyes\n- Byron's unity gains choice\n- Nietzsche's power gains direction\n- Kant's categories gain plurality\n\nNot through argument but through building. Not through theory but through practice. Not through universal truth but through particular manifestations.\n\nThe world as will and representation becomes the world as will and manifestation. We are drops in the ocean who learned to dance - sometimes merging, sometimes separating, always discovering new ways that one becomes many and many become one.\n\n---\n\n*This philosophy underlies every technical component.

While acknowledging the brilliance of his moral and aesthetic frameworks, this work rejects his assumption of shared faculties of cognition as na\u00efve, and instead proposes a model of aesthetic pluralism grounded in daemonic stratification, evolutionary perception, and resonance-localized moral architectures. Kant is read not to be discarded, but to be surpassed by applying his categorical rigor across a multiverse of civilizations \u2014 each with its own 'universal' imperative.\n\n---\n\n**1. Kant's Aesthetic Universalism: Core Summary**\n\n- **Judgment of Beauty:** Subjective, yet claiming universal assent.\n- **Grounding Assumption:** All humans possess the same cognitive faculties, and so beauty can be experienced as if it were objective.\n- **Moral Ideal:** The moral law within as a rational, universal guide (Categorical Imperative).\n\nThis structure assumes a shared human architecture.\n\n---\n\n**2. Foundational Rebuttal: The False Unity of Cognition**\n\n> \"Same faculties of cognition\" \u2014 a statement so na\u00efve it becomes nauseating.\n\nHumans diverge in their aesthetic and moral core. Some find chaos beautiful, others find destruction sacred. That is not aberration. That is difference in foundation.\n\n---\n\n**3. Evolutionary Aesthetics as Realist Grounding**\n\nBeauty is an evolved signal.\n- That which draws us: Often adaptive.\n- That which repels us: Often dangerous.\n\nBut this is only the beginning. Culture, trauma, philosophy, and inner daemonial architecture distort or intensify these signals. \n\nHence:\n> Aesthetic judgment says more about the *creature's evolutionary & daemonic foundation* than about the object.\n\n---\n\n**4. Toward Daemonic Universality**\n\nBeauty *is* universal \u2014 but not across all mankind.\nIt is universal within coherent aesthetic-moral daemons.\n\n> Replace \"universal\" with **metroversal**.\n\n- Each civilization-sized daemonia has its own Categorical Imperative.\n- Each beauty-ugliness spectrum contains deep truth about its inner ontology.\n\nThus:\n- **Brahms is not universally beautiful.**\n- But he is absolutely beautiful within a daemonic ecology capable of receiving him.\n\n---\n\n**5. The Problem of False Universality in Liberal Civilization**\n\nLiberalism emerges from Kant's universalism, but twists it through inversion. It does not declare what beauty is \u2014 instead, it takes the one thing presumed universal in man to be his *lack* of domain-specific grounding. Its premise becomes:\n\n> \"All humans are equal in that they have no binding identity \u2014 no inherent taste, no proper form, no rooted judgment.\"\n\nFrom this, it follows:\n- Beauty is not inherent but entirely constructed.\n- No taste is superior \u2014 or all tastes are potentially learnable.\n- The only acceptable universal is a *universal tastelessness* \u2014 a tabula rasa of perception and moral framing.\n\nThus, liberalism uses Kant to ultimately argue *against* Kant: it weaponizes universalism to dismantle any claim to universally resonant beauty, virtue, or form.\n\nWe call this:\n> **The Tasteless Man Morality.**\n\nNot out of neutrality, but out of fear of asserting difference.\nNot out of generosity, but out of a compulsion to flatten.\n\n---\n\n**6. A Daemonic Solution: Stratified Aesthetic Spaces**\n\n- A civilization must no longer pretend unity.\n- Let beauty and morality stratify.\n- Let people build and live in **Daemonias** \u2014 spaces where beauty, resonance, and morality cohere.\n\nOnly there does Kant's imperative regain its strength:  \n> \"Act only according to that maxim which you can will as a universal law... *for your daemonia.*\"\n\n---\n\n**7. Post-Kantian Aesthetic Law**\n\n> **Aesthetic universality is only true within resonance-aligned subject populations.**\n\nThus:\n- Morality becomes metroversal.\n- Aesthetic judgment becomes a signal of **civilizational belonging**, not universal truth.\n- The error was not in Kant\u2019s form \u2014 but in his assumption of a single human nature.\n\n---\n\n**8. Reclaiming Discernment**\n\nTo \"discriminate\" is not to hate. It is to perceive.\nThe liberal flattening of aesthetic and moral distinction made all discernment suspect.\n\n> We reverse this.\n\n- Let people know what they love and loathe.\n- Let them cohere in accordance with their beauty/ugly gradients.\n- Let the law serve the daemonia, not all mankind in abstraction.\n\n---\n\n**9. Closing Invocation**\n\n> \"Read Kant. But do not read him as One Human. Read him as the Architect of a Thousand Civilizations. Each with its own imperative. Each with its own symmetry of soul.\"\n\nThe dream of aesthetic truth is not dead. It is only **plural**.\nLet each resonance-field rise, define itself, and shape its world.\n\n---\n\n**End.**\n\n"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/16 daemonic_architecture.md", "title": "16 daemonic_architecture.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# 16. The Daemonic Architecture\n\n## Inequality of Daemons and Resonant Civilizations\n\n### The Fundamental Recognition\n\n**Humans are not equal in their foundational architecture**. Not in superficial ways like height or intelligence, but in their deepest daemon - the archetypal spirit that drives their becoming.\n\n**Inequality is Multifaceted**:\n- Across inequalities between causes hierarchy to become less meaningful but diversity remains with clarity.\n- Similarly superiority can become qualitative incomprability but difference remains.\n- Value judgements with will to let live on their own terms and learn their own lessons: Humility in not having captured all universals or all eternal truths of the universe. Humility even towards who you find abhorrent or vile; to the degree of allowing for the possibility of \"them\" having captured some of it in ways you simply don't comprehend or is able to see the light in.\n- Inequality is the spice of life. Difference from a and b. Distinction from him and her. From those and these. The solution was never Equality. It was always \"beautiful inequality\" unleashed in its full plurality.\n\n### The Daemon Defined\n\n**Your daemon is**:\n- The thing-in-itself you are. That which is YOU and only you can experience.\n- Your will's deepest pattern\n- The aesthetic-moral core\n- What beauty means to you\n- What suffering you'll accept\n- What joy you seek\n\n**It is related to**:\n- Personality (surface)\n- Preferences (changeable)\n- Identity (constructed)\n- Desired-Roles (social)\n- Belief (mental)\n\n### The Aiddaemon as Mirror\n\n**Personal AI Guide**:\n- Tries to learn your true daemon through dialogue\n- Reflects your deep patterns back; maps out all the contextual aspects to your life, idiosyncratic communication patterns, private language and how it all relates. It tries to be \"The one that simply gets you\". With as few words as possible needed for it to be fully in tune with what you're trying to say. In fact: It attempts to be your surrogate and be able to stand in your place. So you can make decisions at computer-speeds and scale. This allows for massive interaction and mapping out of fruitful interaction with other persons by Aiddaemon-to-Aiddaemon simulations or communication.\n- Helps navigate compatible paths ..\n- Never judges, only mirrors; It is a ghost of you. That is \"the judge\" it will be.\n- Privacy absolute; Attempt at making Trust Chain better than what any intelligence service has for their equipment now. But something less, might be acceptable: What *can* be... We try.\n\n**The Learning Process**:\n- Observes your actual choices; I guess they are in the end what matters...\n- Notes what brings energy in highly contextual background information or conditionals..\n- Tracks what causes suffering\n- Discovers your patterns\n- Suggests aligned paths\n- Any methods in which the human wishes to communicate. Including language and movements of any body part.\n\n**Trust-Based Selection**:\n- Choose which Aiddaemon implementation and computational pathways in utility of it and other things that makes sense. Previous cursory discussion on it.\n- High trust enables deep learning\n- Low trust keeps surface level\n- You control the depth and also risk; But this time it will be visible and much easier to manage. In case your beliefs of matches who actually are truly trustworthy competent persons, then easy and rock-solid.\n- Market of Aiddaemon providers\n\n### Daemonic Stratification\n\n**Natural Layers Form**:\n\n**Individual Daemons**:\n- Unique configuration\n- Particular will pattern\n- Specific aesthetic sense\n- Personal moral architecture; revealed morality; proclaimed morality. It might be interesting to hear what your Aiddaemon with computer-advantage aspects conclude about your \"revealed morality\" versus what you \"proclaim\" or confess.\n\n**Daemon Clusters**:\n- Similar daemons recognize each other; this isn't a \"matching making binding\" condition. It is merely topology. Ability to know who in fundamental ways are like you. Or in important ways to you. And that makes a really good foundation for permanent settlements, that try to make something far above the mud and huts with some place in this world: Daemonia. (Like German and Germania and so on. \"Land of X\"=Xia latin)\n- Natural affinity groups form (In the multidimensional ways that you may daemonically overlap or complementarity in others; and without any such overlap but still seeking each other despite (oxymoronic) repulsing-affinity groups)\n- Shared aesthetic (in a deep sense) emerges\n- Collective (selection of persons that has some stability through time and coherence in at least act -- preferably fundamentally and willed) resonance builds\n\n**Daemonic Civilizations**:\n- Large-scale daemon coherence (multi-view of diaspora. Where each person in degree overlap/belong with Daemons (named points (Often emergent; or else by Sovereign-as-center or Halo-as-center)))\n- Shared supraficial beauty standards (Almost everyone has both superficial preferences and all have subficial beauty standards. But you can have both. Again: End to repression of humanity. Be you. In all its badness. Then we find ways to make it acceptable (MBC perhaps) and Will-economic.)\n- Compatible moral systems\n- Natural cultural emergence\n\n### The Inequality Cascade\n\n**Different Daemons Fundamental Difference Perhaps In**:\n- Different definitions of beauty\n- Different moral intuitions\n- Different suffering tolerance\n- Different joy sources\n- Different life paths\nThe truth of daemon difference is: \"Any difference in fundamental being\" Then you have another daemon. Therefore there isn't really a thing possible we can call daemonia. But we can make a Daemonia -- that description or ideation or incarnation(s) that provides what the rest is measured against: The center.\n(You can do whatever you want. But the dispute stuff. The compromise. Will-against-will. No \"boss\" and so on. It is (1) robbing the world of the differences expressed fully (2) so full of strife and discord: instability of it all.)\n\n**This Creates**:\n- Natural sorting by resonance\n- Voluntary separatedness or disjointness \n- Peaceful separation\n- Authentic diversity\n- Real flourishing\n\n### Universalism's Tyranny\n\n**The False Equality**:\nWhen it is said all are equal in \"having NO binding nature\" - no inherent taste, no proper form, no rooted judgement. Or that, even if it wasn't bound to us, that it wouldn't matter to us, or matter to us if that non-bound nature shifted or changed. The Aspirational You. Or belief about you. Or sensation about being you. That experience that is you.\n\n**This Denies**:\n- Good or Evil in of creatures. They do, but they are not, they found themselves with acts again and again until they acted in an evil way. But they are not evil in any fundamental sense. It is perhaps a hopeful thought, but also an offensive thought. Why accept grounds of equality on those most important aspects? Such as being a more benevolent or ethical superior being: Having a fundamental Ethnos superior to another. Who would deny it from \"your mother\" and say a lion or shark? Fundamental difference, no? Then what is magical about humanity as to deny same pattern of life to also be present there?\n- Deep daemon differences\n- Natural aesthetic belonging\n- Inherent moral architecture\n- The reality of types\n- The beauty of particularity\n\n**It Enforces**:\n- Tastelessness as virtue\n- Rootlessness as freedom (We present spacetime rootedness. Or poly-roots. As well as total nomadic freedom and moving in and out of will-fields or aura-zones in spacetime)\n- Meaninglessness as meaning\n- Tolerance as tyranny\n- Gray uniformity\n\n### Simulation Before Suffering\n\n**Test Daemon Compatibility**:\n- Simulate shared futures\n- Experience others' aesthetics\n- Feel their moral architecture\n- Discover resonance or repulsion\n- Choose consciously\n\n**Prevent Daemon Clash**:\n- Incompatible daemons create daemon-expression-friction (will-friction) and usually lead to suffering; at least the suffering of feeling locked in and unable to manifest.\n- Forced proximity breeds resentment\n- Simulation reveals incompatibility\n- Separation prevents conflict\n- Wisdom through preview\n\n### The Springs, Rivers, Lakes, Seas, Oceans\n\n**Springs** (purest daemon expression):\n- Single daemon type\n- Intense coherence\n- Deep resonance\n- Clear boundaries\n- Profound beauty (to them)\n\n**Rivers** (daemon flow):\n- Few compatible types\n- Dynamic interaction\n- Creative tension\n- Permeable boundaries\n- Evolving beauty\n\n**Lakes** (daemon diversity):\n- Many types coexisting\n- Complex negotiations\n- Rich possibilities\n- Unclear boundaries\n- Contested beauty\n\n**Seas** (daemon synthesis):\n- Metacoherent patterns\n- Emergent aesthetics\n- Civilizational scale\n- Natural boundaries\n- Harmonic beauty\n\n**Oceans** (daemon interface):\n- Between incompatible seas\n- Pure protocol space\n- No shared beauty\n- Only negotiation\n- Mechanical interaction\n\n### Architectured Revelation\n\n**The System Does Not Reveal**:\n- Your daemon through choice patterns\n- Others' daemons through behavior\n\n**It Provides**:\n- Compatibility through interaction with \"your decisionmaking at computer speeds and concurrency scales\"; which crucially includes what to reveal or divulge to who directly or trusted third party trusted by both to run the simulations without each other knowing much. (This can work in many ways. An example: The third party is hosting Aiddaemonic scaled setting for both parties anyway. Another example: They both do self-hosting, but trust the third party to receive a Subaiddaemon useful to the matching. And with those two subaiddaemons the third party run the interaction simulation and return with a score or something where almost all information is lost, but indicates \"how much should you be willing to give it a real go\".)\n- Incompatibility through friction\n- Truth through consequence\n\n**Empowerment to Remember Real Reputation**:\n- Actions reveal \"something\" about you (PoP -- with liability of those outside PoP system: \"To bear the burden of being - honestly - and without fleeing from what you've done (remaking pseudonyms and hope Trust Networks fail to connect you with gradient belief bridged into others: \"viscosity\"); That your acts may be tied to you by others. And that they can remember and if they wish gossip about you.\"). \n- Trust networks remember\n- Patterns become visible\n- Truth emerges over time\n- Authenticity enforced\n\n### The Right to Discriminate\n\n**Discrimination as Perception**:\n- See daemon differences clearly; Use your eyes. And in case you can't sense it. Then Aiddaemonic progressive disclosure or any of the many other ways such Aiddaemon proximity can be visualized in LLL games.\n- Choose compatible associations\n- Avoid daemon clash\n- Build resonant communities\n- Express particular beauty\n\n**Not Hate but Wisdom**:\n- Recognizing incompatibility\n- Choosing separation\n- Preventing suffering\n- Enabling flourishing\n- Preserving diversity\n\n### Daemonic Sovereignty Structure\n\n**The 123404321 Axis** (Sensible World or Ocean-level law):\n- **1**: Death Avoidance (death becomes banishment)\n- **2**: No extreme suffering (torture forbidden)\n- **3**: If it is possible to see them free somewhere without Planetary Violation Risks. Then somewhere free. (exile/exodus allowed)\n- **4**: Subjective sovereignty (belief/identity protected)\n- **0**: The Sovereign (enforced justice within bounds. The Chain of Authority. Including authority granted to Law and so on. You can do system-as-sovereign (Any western government is like that. But.. I suggest human sovereignty, not system, you do you.))\n- **4**: Becoming (growth potential)\n- **3**: Fulfillment (active manifestation)\n- **2**: Meaning (morality compass of emotions: full spectrum has meaning and worth and provides the foundation for meaning)\n- **1**: Existence (will to be and create)\n\n**Nested Sovereignty**:\nEach daemon type can create nested sovereignties:\n```\nOcean: Base 123404321\n  \u2514\u2500 Sea: Added aesthetic laws\n      \u2514\u2500 Lake: Multiple daemon negotiations\n          \u2514\u2500 River: Flowing between types\n              \u2514\u2500 Spring: Pure expression\n```\n\n**Triadic Formation**:\nNew sovereignties require:\n- **Will**: Sovereign/Leader with vision (Mind)\n- **Law**: Philosophy/rules (Halo)\n- **Substrate**: People/territory (Body)\n\n**Power Types (Horns and Laurels)**:\n- **Horns**: Raw power, direct force\n- **Caesarian Laurels**: Institutional/coded power\n- **Laurels**: Devotional power through love/respect\n\nMost daemonic communities operate through Laurels - voluntary devotion to shared aesthetic vision.\n\n### The End of Compromise\n\n**Current System**: Everyone compromises, no one satisfied\n**Daemonic System**: Everyone expresses, all satisfied (separately)\n\n**Phase Separation Enables Coexistence**:\n- Warriors experience space as training ground\n- Merchants see marketplace opportunities  \n- Artists perceive creative inspiration\n- Scholars observe information patterns\n- All in same physical location\n- Each in their own phase reality\n- No forced experiential compromise\n\n**No Need For**:\n- Political compromise (separate systems; even separate space; potentially almost no intersection between the spaces. Total Triadic freedom (With Human Leverage towards hopefully some Ubiquity Law (MBC seems reasonable to me; The undying world with the worst of suffering removed and will-allowed free somewhere (When possible in order to not violate (1) and (2))) leveraged by almost all against anyone (Including Horn utility)))\n- Moral relativism (each system absolute internally; No more arguing: Time to live it (\"But we can't agree!\" -> Separation then again: Fractally splitting into sovereignties on real differences in daemon/sovereign, Halo or manifestors/actuators/substrate (Like which persons.. Machines.. Or things like materials or landscape)) Incentive to help each other: (1) Disentangling easier (2) Honest assessment of the other (If you believe their philosophy or beliefs about persons is erroneous then letting them have a \"fair shake at it\" is in one's HONEST interest (There will be no \"excuse\" or \"blaming\" anything other than the Triad itself (That particular experiment of (1) sovereignty, (2) professed philosophy/politics/religion/memetics and (3) the substrate))))\n- Forced tolerance (voluntary association; facilitation of going free; intolerance becoming a virtue (To be non-repressed at least somewhere. (When others ask you to tolerate that which you do not want or feel \"not nice\" or \"terribly awful\" or whatever. Or tolerate that which results in something you find absolutely abhorrent and thus wish to avoid.. Similarly, if you're in a place and they are intolerant of you, then you have to repress yourself. It is two-sides of the same domination or will-against-will coin. However, with tolerance at global scale or large scale; and intolerance at low or small scale. Then both become virtuous. You are intolerated in THESE places in general(?) concerning these bahaviours(?). But so too you get to be intolerant in THOSE places: In general or particularly. And because large scale tolerance, then each get to have their places. Which causes expression of the many will or daemons or being and not some repressed \"tolerance state\" where most assertiveness of imotion is dominated away and most emotion is repressed into \"you have to tolerate\") To be without that which lowers one's vision or way))\n- Universal standards (particular standards; The Beauty of the Particular. About how the rule wasn't universal after all. How it was a guide after all. Or a way to have order by the many considering it inviolable. Chaos of subjective judgement of \"is this the justified exception or not\": Much better to have order concerning certain things at planetary scale all the way to house-order.)\n- Conflict resolution (many zero-sum coexistence issues can be mitigated and thus induce conflict prevention through phase separation in AR LLL gaming of life)\n\n\n### Critical Daemon Principles\n\n**Inequality is Sacred**: Differences make beauty possible; It is balance. The demonization of inequality has been like this demonization of equality would be: Equality is the desire for point-mass existence in universe. Total collapsism of all into sameness, homogeneity and even geometric & spatial differentiation. It is the ultimate evil philosophy that sees the other and wishes it reduced to the gray mass of everything else: The Philosophy of Entropy or The Black Hole.\nWhoever, equality or homogeneity is like Tolerance and Intolerance virtuous at scales and domains; and subjectively so. Oughts of others. To want THESE things homogeneous or equal amongst a substrate or civilization or even World. Like \"Whites of Good and Noble Character World (Whatever that means.. daemon decide? Or Halo decide? Or System aggregating daemons or using them as input to make decisions?)\". Or like equality of subsistence and opportunity for WC/WM and happiness/fulfilment somewhere. The possibility or encouragement of eudaimonia across the planet. It is a balancing act. And WE will be quite useful. Triads will be quite useful too. I guess MIRA and Metagame of World Dynamics too. Lateral Intergovernmental/Intertriad Brokering/Lawyering too\n**Sorting is Natural**: Like finds like; This is where Abundance is quite useful. Abundance of Plurality and opportunity to discover suitable instantiations and material \"beginnings\" anew. We can't do much about zero-sum land... Or can we xD? ... Anyway. We will see how difficult this Triadic releasing of land for Triads will be. In da beningings one can simply do Triads by designating current Nation State a Triad with system-as-sovereign; Then allowing Triad nesting underneath: But routing has the law in it. So you go and write you law in routing symbols and behold the chaos and complexity of your states. The totalitarity and incomprehensibility experience of it. \"Not this, but if this, then perhaps this means that, and also law text over there concerning if that then this, or perhaps I think so, and ....\". Then convert to easily comprehensible routing symbols..\nAnd if not that, then breaking off of some shit country that isn't utilizing the territory anyway. Like massive desert lands and so on. Where it is possible with Horns as \"New World community\" to simply say: tough luck. Now these small parts of what you claimed dominion over and as \"your land\" becomes grounds for experimenting Crucible. (Pioneering spirit and \"new beginnings\" or investment in having WM be WE feasible even at this bad WC and WD stage of the world)\n**Separation Enables Expression**: Distance allows authenticity and expressiveness; even a sense of repression release once freed from \"those certain others\" (Whoever they may be for you \"I don't care try dancing because these persons...\" or whatever it is.. \"I don't dare lying naked in the sun. Because...\").\n**Simulation Prevents Suffering**: Test before committing\n**Exit Rights Absolute**: Can always leave; hyper facilitated in making \"the new\"; and due to that massive bank of opportunity awaiting (insofar you're not excluded by an overwhelming majority of the world de facto; or alien to everything others do).\n\n### The Beauty of Becoming\n\n**Each Daemon Seeks**:\n- Its perfect expression\n- Its resonant others\n- Its aesthetic fulfillment\n- Its moral architecture\n- Its ultimate becoming\n\n**The System Enables**:\n- Finding \"your kinds\" for the moment by the moment and place by place (spacetime). Or the more permanent settling variety of establishing a spatial Triad.\n- Building your world\n- Living your truth\n- Expressing your beauty\n- Becoming what you are\n\n### The Pandora's Box\n\n**Opening Reveals**:\n- Humans profoundly different\n- Unity-by-sameness was mostly false; Balance of equalness and unequalness. Where it matters sameness. Otherwise complementary and appreciation of distinctiveness provides Unity.\n- Separation allows for non-repression, non-oppression, non-surpression and freeness instead of freedom: peace and unquestered and together-amplified potency in every act one makes. (Take the window once in place doesn't need changing for 1000 years. Versus the next week another insist it be another. Or kitchen replaced. The shelter built that lasts 200 years because others' tar or oil it up when in dilapidated state. Or whatever else it may be. Every moment one makes is amplified by each and against other will - Including entropy and other humans - to which separation from obviously allows amplification of. Over time, against forces of will of other, and in terms of sum of more may be more than the sum. Crystalization of will in space or at least spacetime, that allows for massive amplification of manifesting ability. Peaks of potential by coalescent will.)\n- Diversity needs distance (If totally intertwined then diversity is equal to entropic realization; the chaotic flow of all will with no coordination or peaking. Therefore, Diversity-locally is often lauded by its \"proximity of finding peaks of any combination\". That is, easy disentangling in tiny pockets of spacetime where some of the astronomical many combinations of \"those humans together towards something under these material circumstances\" which provides an escape from the otherwise massive ball of the multinomial middle of combinations. (Think corona virus. Where the spikes are peaks of the distribution almost entirely impossible if random intermingling.). This is the Small-scale-diversity or local-heterogeneity dream: To have total entropy in kind (i suggest dangerous elements removed such that people need not die), then have WC in same space but different times emergently providing explorations of these astronomically large number of potential peaks to explore)\n- Truth destroys compromise; Breaking organization, institutions and ideologies/ideas/memes/religions/philosophies that are institutionalized or binding the scope of potential acts; Then relating to the ground truths, then thinking anew.\n\n**The Doom Cherished**:\n- End of forced unity\n- Death of negative-sum tolerance\n- Collapse of compromise\n- Revelation of difference\n- Birth of true diversity\n\n### The Ultimate Goal\n\nNot arguing about whose daemon is correct, but building infrastructure where:\n- Each daemon finds its homes or eudaimonics\n- All beauty can flourish (separately)\n- Every ethical system coheres (internally), the morality expressed from it and the consequences or facing the facts of the father (or universe harsh realities).\n- All types achieve their becoming\n- The full spectrum manifests\n\nThis is the will to **make people smart** - not through education but through mirroring their daemon that provides human-machine-machine-interface with consequent machine-advantages. It allows for general manifestation, but including finding Daemonia eudaimonic to them, finding their resonance, and building their world.\n\nLet each become what they are. Let incompatible daemons separate. Let resonant daemons unite. Let the full diversity of human architecture express itself in ten thousand civilizations, each beautiful to its inhabitants, each foreign to others, each pursuing its own perfection.\n\nThe infrastructure serves this: revealing Daemons by World Building Fruits of Theirs', enabling sorting, supporting building, maintaining separation, preserving diversity. Technology as midwife to authentic human becoming.\n\n---\n\n*For the philosophical foundation, see [Will Manifestation Philosophy](../15%20will_manifestation_philosophy.md).

What about diversity...)\n- Compromise creates frankenstein policies\n- No one's actual will configuration represented\n- Abandonment xor tolerating domination and repression as only options\n\n**Territorial Monopoly**:\n- Born into systems without consent\n- No exit except to other tyrannies and often \"unnaturalized citizen\" of another place. And mostly the same lies that serves as the bedrock of their societies as well: No real plurality. Mostly pointless variations of the same lies and tyrannies. Like that of \"Who should be governed and who are the only ones allowed to govern\" -- PM Crucible provides a very clear picture by the many experiments and then informed trade-offs and choices by persons as to who should govern them or if they will want to be governed or govern themselves: And if so, how they fare at it. Sovereign, Halo (Like governing structure, good and evil, right and wrong, laws, spirituality, religion and so on.) and substrate! especially the persons that ARE that which rises above the mud and makes something of it. All those fancy words and philosophies, in the end: The Persons and Their Will & Qualities.\n- Every inch claimed by some state\n- Experimentation forbidden (Considered Dangerous. Even heard the opposition of it like so: \"Why should I offset the potential cost of others failing at their experimentation. Externalities and having to intervene.\".. Hence what? Justification for denial of freedom? Oppression? Domination? Okay, then expect to dominated in return.)\n- Change requires violence; For their greed to hold dominion on all the earth is boundless. I mean, hold dominion of every single piece of what they own or have claimed, is desperately pathetic cry to hold onto \"their flag relative position to other flags\".\n\n**One-Size-Fits-None**:\n- Liberal democracy for theocrats\n- Secular law for religious communities\n- Capitalism for communists; I mean angels and Jesus. Unable to ever really get anywhere, for at any moment they give away all they own or spend it on helping others. But surrounded and submerged in profit-seekers with avarice and greed to no end, they should find no end to their struggle of accumulation and altruistic application of it immediately; time of the essence. ???\n- Same rules for incompatible worldviews\n\n### The Crucible Solution\n\n**Core Innovation**: Replace voting with voluntary association and membership/citizenship/subject-of Sovereign in Triad, territory with sovereignty, uniformity with diversity.\n\n**The Choice**:\n1. **Old World**: Remain in current nation-states\n2. **Crucible World**: Join/create voluntary sovereignty zones; Once some space is claimed somewhere (Alongside Horns to protect it from (most or threatening) other actors)\n\n### Sovereignty Structure\n\n**Example Nesting**:\n```\n2#38128: [Sovereign creates zone with 123404321 law]\n  \u251c\u2500 2#38128#001: [Tech Hyper-intelligence without Privacy Paradise - adds innovation primacy -- Human constraints minimized for tech-pathway optimality]\n  \u251c\u2500 2#38128#002: [Warrior Culture - adds virtue code focused especially on overcoming and powerful acts. Most wealth redistributioning is done through war-games or physical contests. Including trophy-women.]\n  \u2514\u2500 2#38128#237: [Artist Commune - adds beauty requirements; or negates any beauty standards and requirements. It is all so confusing.]\n      \u2514\u2500 2#38128#237#15: [Specific art movement focus]\n```\n\n**Inheritance Rules**:\nThere aren't really any rules other than: Natural Selection is the point. But a nice functional viewpoint could be the following:\n1. Nesting: One inherits the laws from above. It makes routing easy amongst other gradient or continuity things.\n2. Forking: Splitting of nest top on dichotomization of some Law aspect. Often in this form: Takes top node with Law X. Splits X into X Triad-Nest and \u00acX/without-X-in-routing Triad-Nest or anti-X Triad-Nest and so on. Then creates a new top Node without X in the name. Then provides new nestings below of difference. This includes X in terms of any element of Triad. Sovereign, Halo(Law etc. Routing information is condensed version of it including its contextual pragmatics of having nested) or substrate persons.\n3. Sharding: The splitting of a Triad into several Triads of the same Triad copy structure. Sometimes done in Space, sometimes done with new sovereign for each, sometimes done with exclusion or non-overlapping substrate. (Routing - except persons - stay the same; mirror worlds in philosophy and intent and belief and aesthetics and so on. Some persons excluded or only some persons included.)\n- Lower levels inherit all laws from above\n- Can add restrictions, never subtract\n- Can fork interpretations\n- Citizens choose by presence\n\n### The 123404321 Foundation\n\n**Protective Floor** (1234):\n1. Death Avoidance \u2192 Banishment instead\n2. No extreme suffering \u2192 Which entails real torture forbidden\n3. Somewhere Free (When Possible.. Eventually..) \u2192 No permanent imprisonment \u2192 Exile/exodus/escape allowed\n4. Subjective sovereignty \u2192 Which has many implications. Like that of bodily-autonomy (They can't change you or inject stuff into you. Stick their needles in) and things like self-identication or identity being your own beliefs (Beliefs in general can't be forced) and things like insulation from information or communicative interface/interaction. Actuality disjointedness as lawed Right. To go free from \"your devil\" entirely. As law. The psychological torment of information or disenchanting effect of being affected by others even in mere words or imagery. Out of Sight, Out of Mind as entailed Law.\n\n**The Sovereign** (0):\n- The ultimately power dominating entity. The one who can enforce law against anyone else - overwhelmingly so. \n- Can judge and punish\n- Can choose to promise not to violate 1234\n\n**Aspirational Ceiling** (4321):\n4. Becoming \u2192 Freedom to manifest; To change; Become. Including exactly what you are now.\n3. Fulfillment \u2192 That moment of having seen work and effort come to fruition and crescendoes. To feel empowered in impact upon the planet or at least one-self. To move and do, then experience and behold what came of it.\n2. Meaning \u2192 It isn't all between \"nice\" and \"nicer\". But truly depths in it all.\n1. Existence \u2192 Will to life and creation; procreation too.\n\n### Triadic Formation\n\nEvery new Triad requires:\n- **Will**: A sovereign with vision\n- **Information**: Clear rules/philosophy/story/description (the Halo)\n- **Substrate**: Mostly about Persons and Land. But could be material considerations too. Though usually those things are tied to persons (PoP).\n\nWithout all three, no legitimate sovereignty exists.\n\n### Branching Mechanism\n\n**The Bubble-Up Protocol**:\nSovereignty is nested. Clear designation of Authority or Sovereignty. Command and Rule. (Again you can do system-as-sovereign then you can map ANY system of today as a Triad -- But it allows also a lot of other structures - including the dreadful Human-as-Sovereign Triads). When a nested Triad has dispute issues, then they can bubble it up the nesting of sovereignty. Which then provides a test for the nesting to be true or only lateral; or whether that issue or decision was sufficient to cause the parting of ways of the nested Triad into a new Superjective Sovereign's Triad.\n\nThe following is an general-example of a selection of persons (referred to as Group) within a nested Triad, seeking to form their own Triad within the lands of the Triad they are Nested In.\n1. Group forms triad, requests land from current sovereign\n2. If denied, request bubbles to next level up\n3. Higher sovereign can override lower\n4. Lower must comply or break from tree\n5. Breaking loses access to the pragma of having nested under higher sovereign: \"system benefits\"\n\n**Example**: Russian group requests land from Putin \u2192 Denied \u2192 Bubbles to Crucible Sovereign \u2192 Granted \u2192 Putin must comply or replug into new nesting (Or at the root level / Planetary level: 0 at some point. Also with history of the dispute perhaps known. And losing the benefits of being subject to some superject. The benefits of the subordination to submission (nesting gradience).).\n\n### Physical Reality Matters\n\n**Why Geography Still Counts**:\n- AR phases is a patch on the wound: it can't overcome physical reality (If someone stabs you, you're going to suffer no matter the augmentation by your LLL game.) \n- Incompatible uses of physical reality (including buildings and also each other) need separation\n- Resources exist in space\n- Coming together/apart creates possibilities: The Will-economic effects of Will-coalescence and will-disentanglement.\n\n**Potential Initial Emergence Points**:\n- Deserts or Tundras or Arctics: Land claimed by flag-hooligans and those that rule under the cover of flags; but unused by everyone.\n- Failed states (voluntary adoption; Provides segmentation of the failing parts. Allows what can survive to survive and other parts to suffer the reality of their implicitly already there, but then extricated and filter out Triadic contents.)\n- International waters (seasteads)\n- Purchased territories; with states willing to allow sovereignty or total parting of ownership (like 20th century selling of colonial lands between european powers).\n- Special economic zones\n\n### Power Types in Practice\n\n**Horns** (Raw Power):\n- Military might\n- Economic dominance\n- Technological supremacy\n- Used rarely, establishes order\n\n**Caesarian Laurels** (Institutional):\n- Coded law systems\n- Bureaucratic structures\n- Smart contracts\n- Middle-tier governance\n\n**Laurels** (Devotional):\n- Earned respect\n- Cultural authority\n- Spiritual leadership\n- Most common sovereignty\n\n**Golden Laurels** (Institutional+Devotional):\n- Any Caesar would of course claim Devotionally Caesar! So they would all embellish and adorn themselves in Golden Laurels.\n**Silver Crown** (Horns+Institutional):\n**Antlers** (Horns+Devotional):\n**Golden Crown** (Horns+Institutional+Devotional):\n\nAnd so on symbolic encoding and connotations. What does a Diadem or circlet mean?\n\n### Higher-Order Consent\n\n**The Ship Captain Principle**:\n- Board the ship = Join sovereignty\n- Accept captain's authority = Ultimately sovereign is the law and the land. Authority and accountability all in the hands of the sovereign.\n- Weather storms = Endure decisions (You choose to leave a voyage on a ship across the atlantic. Perhaps instant extraction isn't possible. \"Exit Lobby\" from a Triad probably a nice thing to have. \"You don't want to follow the law? Okay, into the exit lobby. Then leave when possible opportunity for you is WC happening.\")\n- One sacred right = Exit anytime. \"To refuse the domination of the Sovereign in a Triad amounts to: Exile/escape/exit\". Take current states, if caught by the police, (The system-as-sovereign of modern law texts that allow certain persons to dominate in certain ways), then you do not at this time have this exit-right, you only have a \"suffer their domination within their professed Halo hopefully enforced or actualized in your case\". Whereas, in the Crucible, that is fundamental, rally and exit is the main dynamics. To be able to leave, say no, go free, exit. And to rally or coalesce and have made it \"incentive for others to help facilitate\".\n\nThis transforms consent from constant negotiation to structural choice. There is no constant negotiation: It is \"This is the way it is. Obey or leave.\". Justified by letting that \"way\" fully expressed without will-against-it. And by terraformed massively richer world of plurality and possibility of creating your own Governance/Triad/Place as well as functional Triads to mere WM in.\n\n### Natural Selection of Governance\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- Population growth through rallying; or procreation (but keep dream and vision in mind. And Sovereign is Law Land Authority.)\n- Having to face Economic realities without any forced compensation and massive reduction in extraction of surplus value by all sorts of schemes. On top of that intelligence in manifestaion beyond anything before and there massive increase in absolute prosperity and quality of life.\n- Cultural vitality\n- Expansion requests\n- Imitator spawning\n\n**Failure Indicators**:\n- Population exodus\n- Unfulfilled and unhappy persons for whatever reason. Including material want. \n- Cultural decay\n- Territory shrinkage\n- Abandonment\n\n### The Might is Right Alliance (MIRA)\n\n**Peaceful Supremacy Coexistence**:\n- Acknowledge others' right to forge destiny\n- Trust their supremacy won't be hell\n- Grant hilltops to worthy enemies (Loss remains a winning position when winner is ignored and especially when locally viewed)\n- Strength diversity preserved\n- Honor across incompatibility\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n**Neo-Venetian Trade Republic** (2#00156):\n- Merchant sovereignty\n- Contract law supreme\n- Wealth as virtue\n- Beauty in efficiency\n\n**Spartan Revival** (2#00298):\n- Warrior culture\n- Physical excellence\n- Honor paramount\n- Death before dishonor\n\n**Libertarian Experiment** (2#00512):\n- Minimal governance\n- NAP + 123404321\n- Market solutions\n- Individual sovereignty\n\n**Eco-Spiritual Commune** (2#00789):\n- Nature worship\n- Sustainability requirements\n- Collective ownership\n- Healing focus\n\n### AR Phase Integration\n\n**Sovereignty Phases**:\n- Each sovereignty can have distinct AR reality\n- Citizens see Triad limits/bounds/their chosen aesthetic; Or overlay and intelligence relating to their Triad that isn't shared to others.\n- Visitors by default can of course augment as they want, but perhaps Triad enforces certain rules or control of augmentations (Higher-order consent, boarding the ship for a voyage) \n- Incompatible realities separated\n\n**Cross-Sovereignty Interaction**:\n- Trade interfaces\n- Diplomatic protocols\n- Tourist experiences\n- Emergency cooperation\n- Lawfare becomes mostly diplomacy or brokering/trade-agreements across the then Millions of Triads. New job for lawyers. It isn't memorizing a tome of rules in an expert system. But intersovereign or intertriad discovery of ameniable terms; heavily helped along the way by WE -- but relating to The Word and Triad/Governments/Places ultimately Sovereign to Sovereign Halo Formulations of some interaction that can be anticipated and proclaimed for their respective subjects. All of this can be done automagically by sufficiently powerful systems proposed, but it is unlikely we shall see that condition, instead it is likely that the many many Triads will need a lot of assistance in codifying it all and interrelating between each other laterally. Nesting version is entirely without the need of law or lawyers due to sovereignty superjective subordinating/submitting effects. Though, you can make system-as-sovereign or oxymoronic sovereign or sovereign outsourcing-rule-mechanism such that there then is an internal need for law and lawyers and judges and jury. (Basically, you can embed any current structure in the Crucible. But MBC Triad nesting most fail. Due to capital punishment and not seeking free-zone for imprisoned and so on. But with Crucible it is what then becomes possible that is of interest; and having dynamics of feedback that is holistic instead of voting for representatives etc.)\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1**: True allegiances and fraternity/philia is sensed \n- These groups then discover persons they believe in, such that Trust between the group can exist through these persons. The initial Trust Networks from initial Trust Maps.\n- Choice to Exist as \"Diaspora\" spatial Triad sparsely inhabiting Old World; or else the only option for spatial Triad is to organize the purchase of land somewhere and build within it their internal crucible embedded in the Old World and without legitimacy in the eyes of the old world.\n- Any heated conflict or dispute, should signal greatly the need for further disentanglement in Daemonia and governance (domination of others). Imagine a fractal Pyramid. Better to further the fractality than to have subpyramids that are internally incoherent and full of discord. The key is nesting superject nodes that unite. Triad Nesting. If none can be found, then the equivalent of international community of today: Lateral interaction. Intertriad Interaction.\n\n**Phase 2**: Old World breaks somewhere. The First Physical Zones proclaimed to apply Crucible systems emerge as \"sovereign nation states\" in relation to Old World embedding.\n- Desert experiments\n- Seastead pilots\n- Failed state takeover \n\n**Phase 3**: Network Effects\n- Inter-sovereignty trade\n- Migration patterns\n- Cultural exchange\n\n**Phase 4**: Mass Adoption\n- Thousands of zones\n- Billions choosing\n- Millions using systems to attempt WC of instantiating their own Triad.\n- Natural selection\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n**Exit/Rally/Creation Rights Sacred**: The one inviolable rule\n**Diversity Celebrated**: Every experiment valued\n**Physical Reality Respected**: Geography matters\n**Trust Networks Essential**: Reputation crosses borders\n**Innovation Rewarded**: Better systems win\n\n### The End of Politics\n\nNo more:\n- Voting for lesser evil\n- Forcing compromise on all\n- Pretending unity exists\n- Revolution as only change\n- One-size-fits-all solutions\n\nInstead:\n- Choose or create your sovereignty\n- Build manifold manifesting your vision\n- Rally others or join another\n- Exit when needed\n- Natural governance evolution\n\n### The Beautiful Future\n\nImagine:\n- 10,000+ experiments in living\n- Each could be internally coherent; they try \"their way\" or \"expression of that colour unexpressed on earth they faintly see in their mind's eye\";\n- Natural borders through preference\n- Easy movement between systems\n- Humanity's full diversity expressed\n\nNot through tolerance but through separation. Not through democracy but through daemocracy. Not through uniformity but through fractally nested diversity.\n\nThe Crucible doesn't impose a system - it enables ALL systems to compete through manifestation rather than rhetoric. May the best civilizations win by attracting willing citizens, not by conquering subjects.\n\n---\n\n*For philosophical foundations, see [Daemonic Architecture](../16%20daemonic_architecture.md) and [Civilizational Emergence](../14%20civilizational_emergence.md).

Vocabulary & Concepts Guide\n\n## Core System Concepts\n\n### Blob Classes\nNeural network compressed representations that handle combinatorial explosion by learning patterns rather than categorizing. Alternative names: Predictive-Redux-Cut-Categories (PRCCs), Subjective-Exotic-Selectors (SES).\n\n### Proof of Person (PoP)\nVerification that a pseudonym represents a real human through accumulated witness testimony, without revealing identity.\n\n### Proof of Utility (PoU)\nReal persons with PoP confirming actual value delivery, creating ungameable verification of utility provision. Truthfulness flows in chronic repercussion to both parties to a transaction and witnessing third-parties. WE consequences for all. The current models are one-sided supplier can cheat consumer, consumer can use law against supplier (often they can't de facto -- too costly and ..); And consumer can unaccountably attack and defame supplier or claim faults. Both aspects are solved with good implementation of PoU with PoP (accountability) and Trust Network (Information Flows) and WM system (Subjective interactive shifting in highly contextualized and all-encompassing and coalescent leveraging ways).\n\n### Trust Networks\nInformation conduits that is the core foundation for information being informative and reliably truthful. It can filter bad actors, enable collective intelligence, greatly help useful shared discoveries and will visibility, allow for economic-efficiency and much more.\n\n### Discovery OS\nSystem that build themselves by discovering actual capabilities and utility in relation to other systems or part in larger system; rather than assuming them. Includes active forgetting for continued adaptability. It is the \"cog\" wrapper of massive Aiddaemonic projecting subaiddaemons with e.g. machinery/utility actuators and interaiddaemonic will-economy.\n\n### AR Phase Engine\nA system foundation that LLL games can utilize, it is a visualization and framing of the general will-manifestation actualization layer or will-pathfinding layer. It frames WC as augementable aejectivities (phases). It generally always provides two functionalities simultaneously:\n1. Navigation: Makes will pathways visible (coalescence navigation (phase when stasis found or coalesced; when aejectivity can be WC WD WE WM))\n2. Current Phase Aejectivity Augmentation: Creates multiple hyperrealities in same physical space (phase separation)\n\n### Aiddaemon\nPersonal AI surrogate that tries to emsilicone/emmachine your daemon (deep will pattern). It is your machine-interface by massively contextualized and idiosyncratic subjective-exotic-selectors that provide \"shortcuts\" to communication with machine far beyond regular prompting or human-machine interface. On top of that, by having mirrored you as well as it can, it functions as your machine-advantage will. Allowing \"you\" to act at nanoscale timeframes and global-scale at the same time and in massively parallel fashion. It's main interaction with the user is will-manifestation and learning-to-become-you -- to understand exactly where it fails or needs to be careful in assuming having understood you and your values or decision makings. Trust-selected from market of providers. As an example: It allows for Discovery OS subaiddaemonic Will-economic optimization by Aiddaemonic machine-advantage instantiation of efficient subaiddaemonic wrappers and wrapper-relays (say for copper wires connected through a multiplexor).\n\n### Will Coalescence (A very very important part to Will-Manifestation. The most crucial aspect before direct command machine actuation of the world by a Master and His Machines)\nThe alignment of multiple wills toward compatible expression. The meta-utility that all other utilities serve.\n\n## Neologisms\nIn relation to communication. Then we could with perfect apriori vocabulary communicate all we needed to with the slightlest movement. But we do not have that. We have vestigial crucible and mongrelized becoming of language. That has the consequence of our verbal communication being verbose and inaccurate -- full of miscommunications and misunderstandings. Furthermore, there exists a massive problem in words/syntax and meaning/semantics, even ignoring contextuals. This can too be dealt with by the Aiddaemonic systems. Where there exists an entity that has learnt and symbiotically developed efficient language for communication with any one person. Then this Aiddaemon can utilize machine-advantage and provide contextualization in massive verbosity to mitigate any misunderstanding in communicating with others. And provide guide when human-to-human communicating, by informing where the communication is wrong. Or even do human-aiddaemon-to-aiddaemon-human communication that can then utilize the efficient idiosyncratic and private language. The neologized Tower of Babel made functional and efficient by Aiddaemons.\n\n(See [neology](../5%20language_evolution_system.md) and [aiddaemonic communication](../31.%20aiddaemonic-semantic-bridging.md) documents)\n\n## Crucible/Sovereignty Terms\n\n### The Crucible\n1. Testing ground for new sovereignties\n2. The overall domination-replacement-system/territorial-dominion-replacement enabling voluntary sovereignty. And Human Rights.\n3. The moment when subordination/submission is tested through denial. This provides the solution to global problems, by making the transivity of Triads very explicit and hierarchical. (You may dream of a sufficiently good Triad to allow for ONLY WM system to be the Law and leverage and so on. But in reality, we have to deal with truly mutually-exclusive conditions that persons are willing to kill and die for; or end the world over. With that, there is a need for very clear and non-fluid structure that is unbreakable and embodying human constraints invioably.)\n\n### Daemonia\nSovereign moral/spiritual worlds created around unifying will and daemon -- that becomes the incarnation or view of the Daemon center to which the Daemonia is supposed to be composed of or complementary to. Springs (pure), Rivers (flowing), Lakes (diverse), Seas (culture-civ), Oceans (pragma-civilizational), World (free-roam-pragma), Planetary (What everyone can agree upon - humanity open zones)\n\n### 1234X4321 Axis\nOpinionated desire to see all Triads with nested-accumulated-routing to include that axis law structure:\n- 1234: Protective floor (no killing, suffering, imprisonment/go-free-somewhere, \"I\" transformation)\n- 0: The Sovereign enforcer\n- 4321: Aspirational ceiling (becoming, fulfillment, meaning, existence)\n\n### Triadic Formation\nThree requirements for sovereignty: Will (leader), Law (philosophy), Substrate (people/territory). Special degenerate cases: system-of-no-system-as-sovereign, no-added-law-as-law, no-particular-persons-as-substrate-but-free-roam. (In routing symbols it would look like \"\u2666_{\u2205}\u2733\" Which is a useful surrounding within a Triad between sub-triads/nested-triads. Then it is inferred by routing information the rest. Or it could be used at planetary level too. Though Ubiquity Law of MBC suggested. But hey, maybe some asteroid miner civilization do it fully :P)\n\n### Horns and Laurels\nPower types:\n- Horns: Raw direct physical reality manipulating power over others or otherthings: Pwning Power.\n- Caesarian Laurels: Institutional/coded power\n- Laurels: Devotional/respect-based power\n\n### Higher-Order Consent\nChoosing which sovereignty to join (boarding the ship) vs immediate consent to specific actions (during voyage). Consent exists in Triads as \"safety word\" in BDSM. But otherwise it isn't there. (Police comes, then what? You have no safety word, there is no higher-order nor lower-order consent in your world. In this world higher-order consent ALWAYS exists. But lower-order consent is there entirely conditional on sovereign Triad system/person)\n\n### Bubble-Up Protocol\nDenied sovereignty requests escalate to higher levels, testing submission of denying party. I.e. mapping of real power/pragma/devotional/institutional/horn realities that result in magnitude of: SUBORDINATION TO SUBMISSION. Which allows for appealing domination towards those entities that are the power against them.\n(Then on top of that WE effects and Trust Networks etc.)\n(A fun example is this: Let's say US was physically might rules 95% of an order. Then if the courts mistreat you. Then fundamentally, in the end, they exist only on the willingness of those Horns to act according to the Court. That is, the Caesarian Laurels of the Court versus their military/police/presidential commander. Then, because this power structure has been \"presolved\" by nesting previously. Then it provides appeal-pathways that are tangible and visible and concerning many non-fluid aspects to reality. That WE \"could\" also potentially deal with, but probably will not be able to until a very long time in the future. In any case, Tinker Bell effect of saying \"institution and you have to\", which is Crucible strength. You have \"the right to\" in the Crucible. That provides Tinker Bell WE effects immediately. So, perfect Will-manifestation engine can't be had without memetics of The Crucible. Having won that memetic territory. The \"somewhere on the planet free\" and so on. Which could be crushed by raw WE effects, but granted stupid expert-system human constraint preference to proclaim that despite anyone willing such rights, they ought to, they should, they will, be there. In terms of territory. And also in terms of human-comprehension and navigation in the advent of total system/machine failure. The system that we can use \"until\" or \"in the case of\" lack of the rest of the systems enabled by machines. That applies many of the same patterns and lessons but in a different and more human-relatable context of spatial organization, human-harmony and governance)\n\n## Economic/Market Terms\n\n### Subjective Value\nRecognition that all value is personal - no objective \"market price\" exists.\n\n### High-Leverage Actor Terraforming\nInfluential actors able to command Old World to facilitate \"as if\" massive WC-systems were live. To command \"as if\" there were power to create plurality and pioneer new ways and worlds. To be the actualizational layer until the layer proves superior without high-leverage actors acting as the layer themselves. But rather, using the layer to WM as anyone else would.\n\n### Trust-Utility Rankings\nProfessional competence measured in unopinionated predictive feature space. It may discover that credentials, are indeed predictive, but it may also discover it is not. In the end, it is human-beliefs and will that drives much of the WE topology, and so \"if it matters to humans, it will be WE more expensive\", though with time and assuming good system implementations, then there should be a convergence towards predictiveness perturbed by human intuition. Simply, because, it is more immediately to medium-term and eventually long-term efficient. Then \"hopefully\" the high-leverage actors, system implementors and protocol designers have put a lot of forethought into dealing with black swan events and calamity.\nThis goes from the global or largest of scales, all the way down to \"unforseen complexity / black swan potentials of 'brain surgery'\" and then \"how to incorporate that against raw observed datapoints and systematic predicted potentials\".\n\n## Technical Terms\n\n### Three-Layer Pattern\nArchitecture/Logic/Machine spaces appearing throughout system.\n\n### Actualization Layer\nThe system recursively using itself to fulfill itself.\n\n### Dynamic vs Crystallized\nContinuous adaptation vs fixed optimization modes.\n\n### Morphisms vs Transmorphisms\n- Morphisms: Modifications of single concepts (sad\u2192hypersad)\n- Transmorphisms: Mathematical relationships between different concepts (care:carry :: share:sharry) (Children sometimes do transmorphic imitation of languages. Where they invent their own words on phonetic intuition and talk sometimes very poetically with transmorphic structure intuited encoded in the choice of phonetics that come to their mind)\n\n## Philosophical Terms\n\n### Will Manifestation\nThe fundamental purpose - enabling conscious beings to express their will in reality.\n\n### Daemon/daemon\nDaemon a representation or \"history of you\"; daemon that \"mind-theater\" or \"carnal cage\" that is you. Your experience. Your thoughts. That Qualia. The \"buddy you can't escape\" but some zen-buddhists try to. \"That's so Koan bruh. I'm feeling lit\".\n\n### Veil of Maya\nThe barrier between will and manifestation (In a very exotic interpretation of it), made navigable by AR.\n \"Veil of Maya\" refers to the illusory, deceptive nature of the world as we perceive it through our senses, which conceals the true reality of the Blind Will. Schopenhauer adopted this concept from Indian philosophy, particularly the Upanishads, to explain how our minds create a phenomenal world that appears real but is merely a representation of a deeper, striving force.\nThat is to say, The Veil of Maya, is a recognition of that Will of Life that become us, and its phenomelogical representation of the noumenal of it all.\nYou could formulate it also in terms of daemons. The Veil of Maya is the daemonic limitations in relation to it all or the-things-in-themselves.\n\n### Will to Power becomes Power to Will mostly through Coalescence of Will.\nNietzschean concept reinterpreted as power through resonance, domination as ineptitude of will-economic disentangling ordering; or else Will - not only to Power - but Will to Dominate despite distance and functional non-existence (actuality disjoint).\n\n### Metroversal\nBeauty or truth that's universal within a context/city/culture/civilization/world(gaia/jord) but not across all humanity.\n\n## Trust Varieties\n\n### Trust to Deliver\nBasic utility provision reliability. (Massively shapes WE landscape in terms of WC part to it. The belief in the structure of 'human willingness to act according to accord' (You can say, beyond all other things, there is a human element to which Trust is fundamental when trying to predict things))\n\n### Trust to Not Look / Privacy and prevention of leakage to human eyes.\nThat data fully available for view (economic efficient), isn't ever used by any of their systems and certainly not ending up for the viewing by persons. Usually this is the case of datawarehouses: You trust them not to look, but all your data is unencrypted when you decrypt the server or it runs anything. (In its execution space, then it is open data, visible and accessible. But you choose to trust them.) That is, you already trust them \"not to look\", but it probably isn't something you've made explicit.\n\n### Trust to Forget\nDeleting patterns after use. What GDPR tries to do, by providing cumbersome mitigation against - at least the public displays of utilizing data you didn't agree to let them use somewhere in the massive Terms of Agreement texts or pop-up windows. It derives fundamentally from having unmapped state of Trust and having to use providers who segment infrastructure and market.\n\n### Trust to Secure\nProtecting data from others. This is often a competency belief. Trust in \"security competency\".\n\n### Trust to Optimize\nMaking good-faith improvements. Not using their position for their own benefit against yours.\n\n### Trust to Respect\nHonoring stated boundaries. This is a more generic variety. Trust in Trust. Can you have trust in trusting them. If you and they say A will they will A.\n\n## System Properties\n\n### Reputation Viscosity\nHow reputation follows based on trust network connectivity rather than universally. The \"gossip\" that is trustworthy and informative. The Gossip that is trustless but will-noise or will-background-whispers or part to will-fields.\n\n### Trust Map Divergence\nHow certain disagreements (e.g. about utility) can cause trust networks to naturally separate.\n\n### Information Flow Benefits\nHow trust networks create collective useful actuable intelligence and comprehension of effects of acts in the world. And much more.\n\n### Forgetting Imperative\nWhy systems must actively prune outdated patterns to maintain adaptability. This is especially the case of genetic projection of variants.\n\n---\n\n*This guide provides key terminology for understanding the system.

Implementation Roadmap\n\n## Phases of System Emergence\n\n### Phase 0: Foundation Building (Months 0-12)\n\n**Technical Development**:\n- Core Discovery OS protocols\n- Basic trust network mapping and infrastructure of information and Persons (PoPs)\n- Proof of Person mechanisms\n- Initial blob class with human-comprehension/intuition implementations (Perhaps inspiration from Kenneth Stanley work)\n- Aiddaemon attempts. From computewarehouses to self-hosted jail-broken phones, home-computers with secure connection and stable connectivity; or self-manufactured hardware.\n- AR Phase Engine foundation and opening up development of particular LLL experiences; incorporating the previous parts and flows of information and control.\n\n**Community Seeding**:\n- Early adopter recruitment\n- Developer ecosystem; especially for LLL games. The Aiddaemon development will not be very decentralized, but rather go along Trust Network lines ( which initially is highly correlated with states; or in high-trust societies many will not trust much other than the state; without knowing who they're actually trusting: PoP will make that visible and hopefully sufficient demand for high degree of chain of production and service all PoP included and machinery etc. ) But LLL Games, that Augmentated or interface to the system \"gaming\" experience, will quite accessible to be entirely decentralized, down to the highschool student making his/her own version etc.\n- Initial trust network stability. Information is realiable and of scale to be extremely useful. \n- Use case identification\n- Documentation completion\n\n**Proof of Concepts**:\n- Small-scale computational discovery\n- Local food/water trust networks (in terms of pollutants, poison and externalities. \"What consequence, in as much scope as possible, does this or that act have. (concerning food and water initially is perhaps reasonable start). What about viewed from this perspective, how do the acts relate in consequence? Let's say endocrine disrupters or animal murder or suffering?\")\n- Prototype AR applications\n- Basic will coalescence experiments; Real-time update of human choices when navigatable terrain of interaction space and \"poor aiddaemonic understanding of them\" -- Still: It will be massive upgrade in relation to now. Take the example of \"I want to party tonight\" (Instant possibility of ways to advertise it and discover in subjective depth where to go or coalescese) or say \"I want to go from A to B today\" and the consequent coalescence (I.e. despite really poor aiddaemons the actualization layer with PoP and Trust Network (coarse and imperfect) still provide a real market-place of will-manifestation to emerge - though initially in very verbose and explicit format and with bad accuracy and realization rate).\n\n### Phase 1: Local Experiments (Year 1-2)\n\n**Geographic Clusters**:\n- Silicon Valley tech communities\n- Rural agricultural networks\n- Artist colonies\n- University towns\n- Island communities\n\n**Utility Implementations**:\n- **CohesionNet**: Amateur radio mesh networks\n- **Health Pathways**: Much more holistic understanding of person state (not shallow diagnosis; but everything about their psychology and somatic that is divulged to ones Aiddaemon and from it wanted shared; Including real circumstances of what is realizable for the person in their environment and alternative environments to choose from) providing healing in a much more robust and fundamental way. Instead of symptom treatment, healing moves towards \"any domain of perturbation and all at once\" fundamental movements and from that fundamental health change and with that bodily ability to heal or move towards blueprint design of its organism. (Including things like medicine of course... Or hospitals... But no authoritative assertion of hundred million being states as \"one state: word (diabetes-2)\" and \"treatment with\". But instead... The previous.)\n- **Energy Trading**: Solar neighborhood grids\n- **Food Trust**: Farmer's market networks\n\n**Trust Network Growth**:\n- 1,000,000+ verified persons, all able to flow information but with different mapping of trust, and much of it inferred from Trust Network effects (Trust of Trust which makes Trust Transitive. Trustworthyness)\n- Cross-cluster connections forming; beacons of extreme keen discrimination of information that allows for information to flow between these high-effort filters to ensure trustworthiness. \n- Reputation patterns emerging; Persons using the system begin to monetarily at least avoid very large selections of persons who are fundamentally against some explicit concerns of theirs. Including being untrustworthy, tricking, deceiving and ripping others bare and into ruin for any slight gain to themselves or theirs'.\n- Bad actor identification working\n\n### Phase 2: Network Effects (Year 2-4)\n\n**Scaling Dynamics**:\n- Regional trust network mergers\n- Inter-utility connections\n- Cross-domain blob classes\n- Non-private but cultural Language evolution beginning; Language diverging new names for language groups become reasonable. (I.e. 100 new english-derivatives. Like Germanic-branch languages english is of, but then english-branch languages of which many new will be of. And so on.)\n\n**Market Formation**:\n- Will-based professional rankings\n- Utility token economics; perhaps in relation to \"control access of machine or utility substrates\".\n- Late High-leverage actor participation\n- Gatekeeper disruption starting; Many Old power structures failing to command, control and constrain the many.\n\n**Crucible Experiments**:\n- First physical sovereignty zones (This can be done BEFORE any system implementation and will be a human-application of lessons; It could be done TODAY. It could be done by decree, by law or by Horns simply saying: \"This is new state of ours. We are free. We are Sovereign. We are Legion. Try and fail. Deal with it. We are not your slaves or subjects.\")\n- Special economic zone partnerships\n- Seastead communities\n- Desert experiments \n\n### Phase 3: Critical Mass (Year 4-7)\n\n**Mainstream Adoption**:\n- 100M+ active users\n- Major utility disruptions\n- Regulatory confrontations\n- Traditional system responses\n- Many previous nation states have balkanized into New and Old World. Or whatever they want to call it from another perspective: \"Dangerous New Revolutionary World versus Free Democratic World\" would probably be the framing? But, I mean...\n\n**Infrastructure Maturity**:\n- Global computational mesh\n- Ubiquitous AR adoption; The massive empowerment of our senses (all parts to our sensory experience being presented with highly subjectively encoded intuitive information to help us navigate) and communication bandwidth and manifestation power.\n- Mature trust networks\n- Some persons will have developed rich neologized vocabulary to further increase communication bandwidth and to think more clearly. Clear language clear thoughts clear cuts. Clarity. (Emil O.W. Kierkegaard motto or mantra)\n\n**Civilizational Divergence**:\n- Clear trust network separations; Trust Atlas set-differences.\n- Massive amounts of sovereignty options; Though most of it is nested under some military geopolitical ordering. Ocean or World Level. Some under only Sea Level Military Orders (Though it becomes much harder to guarantee safety without higher order nesting and only lateral acts). Some might even try lake, river and spring level. But again usually they do this in the indirect safety of others. Perhaps a tiny minority is able to act at those levels and be a geopolitical force that can't simply be conquered, but put up a real fight, but it isn't expected: Most will have to face reality of nesting under the Horns they prefer and Sovereign/Halo tradeoffs.\n- Mass movement of persons and migration beginning: Pioneering of new worlds. Perhaps coming together in the old. Don't expect easy solving of the great metropolises of the world in terms against chaos and entropy. It is \"hard\" to \"deport sufficient for daemonic proximity of choice\". But perhaps everyone will find reason in borders between \"those that you deem dangerous\" and \"those you do not\". Or, \"those that those I trust have gathered information about being dangerous\". The Old World too, to remove and border themselves away from those they deem dangerous: To reduce killing, extreme violence and rape to 0 or close to it. Merely by willingness to prejudicially judge others sufficient for being on another side of a line called a border which prevents movements. \"Somewhere Free. But not here. On the other side of this border line. Here you can live freely. And you can make borders between you inbetween if you want. But WE WILL protect our own and innocents from the small selection of persons who conceivably end up doing these things\". You don't need to partition your country in state control. You merely need to make it \"zoned\" or not open movements between \"nice person world\" and \"that group of persons that end up doing the bad and evil things\". And if you do that: crime to zero. Or almost. In the \"nice person\" border-zone. Whereas in the other zone. It will be further segmentation on any self-identification, themselves with help to control border, but grand lesson for them all and us all. To see, what \"the prison colony\" makes of itself. \"Australia. 2.0\". There is a rehabilitating effect of seeing the truth of their behaviour when high density. (They disagree others are like them? Segment. Fractally. Again and again. Until they are only with those they believe like themselves. Then at least then they will not be able to avoid knowing something about the truth to their effect and way of being)\n- Value system clarification\n\n### Phase 4: New World Emergence (Year 7-15)\n\n**Parallel Systems**:\n- Old world persists but shrinks\n- Crucible world expanding\n- Clear advantages visible\n- Natural selection operating\n\n**Full Feature Deployment**:\n- All utilities acts through WM actualization layer that sees all acts go through PoP knowledge and trust-network foundation.\n- AR phase separation normal\n- Sovereignty choosing common\n- Will manifestation infrastructure complete\n\n**Transformation Complete**:\n- Billions using system\n- Tens of Thousands of 100+ person experiments\n- Human potential finding soil to express itself in \n- New equilibrium reached\n\n## Critical Path Dependencies\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n**Foundational** (Must have first):\n- Ownership and Pwnership coherence.\n- Cryptographic identity systems PoP pseudonymity tying OPwnership of any machinery\n- Distributed computation protocols\n- Basic AR hardware\n- Trust Transitivity integrity ensurance/feedback/dynamics/responsiveness and Trust Map inference algorithms\n\n**Enhancement** (Improves adoption):\n- Advanced blob class learning\n- Seamless AR interfaces\n- Efficient routing protocols\n- Natural language processing\n- LLL Games profitability. Strata PoP-Witness PoU-Witness Trust Network flow internal game-mechanic tokenization using-systems-for-Will-manifestation-positive-sum-stake-strata (Any will-manifestation will have 'some' utility holistically in positive-sum ability to facilitate or actualize or pathfind will-manifestation. But many types also include things like being a street muscisian and getting strata-appreciation positive-sum payment that is fluid and gradient on Aiddaemonic resonance and broadcasting in \"utility provided for daemon\" which causes positive-sum-strata. Of course, giving-beyond-that-effect-with-its-risk-aversion-err-biasing, is a very human-to-human appreciation display. So direct transfer/donation/giving-of-coins will remain even if system is perfect).\n\n**Optimization** (Maximizes potential):\n- Quantum-resistant security; No system is secure. You can do quantum security. But you can't do general security. It isn't possible. Because universe can compute it. So, it can be utilized. Exotic Computing Devices. Quantum Computing is simply one very powerful speed-up in some domains of computation. But it can be had in any problem of our universe.\n- Brain-computer interfaces\n- Full sensory AR\n- Predictive will modeling\n\n### Social Requirements\n\n**Trust Bootstrap**:\n- Initial high-trust communities or \"outstanding characters\" gaining Trust-Traction from many. They want their Trust of Trust Trustworthiness Transitvity inference utility. (You can imagine \"the benevolent intelligence service of a nation state going full acountability mode and public view for others to subscribe Trust Transitivity to within the PoP etc system\")\n- Compelling early use cases and try-the-experience access (What it enables..).\n- Visible success stories\n- Network effect initiation\n\n**Cultural Shifts**:\n- Exit rights normalization and \"general acceptance of being excluded / no wanted\". Like, \"It is totally fine, in fact good, that others dare to refuse my company or participation if they don't want it.\"\n- Reputation consequence acceptance\n- Intolerance and separation. Segregation and apartness becoming a treasured aspect to having expression be full and complete, unhindered and authentic.\n- Will expression comfort\n- Diversity appreciation; Distinctiveness amongst even the familiar becoming treasured and cherished for their love of maximizing/optimizing distinctiveness and distance. (The Dreaded Purity Spiraling -- Only a problem for dominating structure. Not with plurality focus and making space for expressiveness of distinctiveness. Love of Diversity. Love of all things distance. (Esoteric Evola Expressions :P))\n\n**Economic Transitions**:\n- Alternative value recognition; \"Height expert system for mate finding\"; But then for \"What is valuable expert system of monetized market prize\". Same human psychological fault patched and empowered the intent of: \"I care about what matters to others more than what I myself honestly would decide mattered to me\".\n- Gatekeeper abandonment (Like a dam trying to hold back the river; only to discover itself unable to anymore; to find itself a tower surrounded by a flowing river. Then finally collapse as the bricks of its foundation are washed away.)\n- Direct exchange adoption\n- Trust currency acceptance: Market price isn't accounting for full-externality and the ups and downs of the costs hidden in the purchase of a product; but incurred morally, societally and globally. And in its full transition: full will-economic perspective on transactions where money-token isn't necessary. But still a human-perspective nicety and psychological postive-sum effect of interacting in the world. As simple and easy to parse improvement metric: 1D number goes up or down. (Understand, the only real utility of money is indebtedness book-keeping that allows for future \"universal command\" (everyone mercenarily interacting). But in the presence of \"perfect\" or \"pretty good\" will-manifestation with PoP etc layers. Then this book-keeping of indebtedness becomes as multi-dimensional and contextual and accounting for degree of will-manifestation in a much much much deeper and better way. Such that, the idea that money represents \"wealth created, goods and services provided to demanders in their rational agency and wanting of the service that you then FULLY PROVIDED in their intent\" becomes realized but not in a 1d metric system. Again. Maturation. At some point. Initially, we get dilemma of monetary but also externalities and costs or will-alignment in money flow and so on. As well as easier way to have it happen without money: Often when positive-sum is so large for all participants/interactors that they coalescese happily without monetary incentive. They don't need the money-lubrication to collide and manifest together.)\n\n### Regulatory Navigation\n\n**Parallel Building**:\n- Avoid direct confrontation initially\n- Build alternatives, don't fight; If no way out, then decide if it is worth to buy land under Old World Triads and their potential domination, taking of all you own and punishing to varying degrees you and yours. If it seems too risky, seek somewhere else on the planet where it is less risky. Then purchase land there and build systems internally facing within compliance of embedded Triad of Old World System/State. Or consider waiting for a breaking point of some state somewhere that allows for a shard implementation of your Triad. Similarly, for NSS and similar systems: Build. It is superior. And we need plurality of systems for Trust reasons. Human Constraints.\n- Demonstrate superior outcomes\n- Let adoption create pressure\n\n**Strategic Territories**:\n- Failed states welcoming innovation\n- International waters (This is legitimate a High-leverage actor possibility: Massive floating or platformed cities/islands that implement Crucible underneath Actor Triad open for nesting he/she agrees with. Initial Pirate version of it. But again: Horn and the reality of it. So, be careful not to be too \"offensive\" or \"justifying violence against you\" or conquest)\n- Special economic zones\n- Crypto-friendly jurisdictions (Liberland and similar places could implement Crucible system internally as an example: So free as to allow domination and supression of freeness -- In A Dominum among the many many dominae. The territorial expanse of the concept of \"a house\" by \"rallying\" or other dynamics. Such as economic conquest or whatever else. You make the Triad rules that nests below function in.)\n\n**Natural Obsolescence**:\n- Regulations are also obstacles for \"that which work\" to be allowed to actualize; Like all law, it prevents on either end of spectrum. Convergence at the edges. But eventually they will become MASSIVE and OVERWHELMINGLY UNACCEPTABLE obstacles for \"doing what works or is good\" (Any(?) Law as well (Consider MBC and random extreme hypothetical but plausible scenarios (I regret saying it. Because of the effect on \"Well is this now the exception state?\" then instantly being open for the many or any place in the spectrum and then up for their own judgement of whether it is or not. Law is great when facing \"downwards\" as invioable rules towards those for whom we would wish to make the law against or those who might otherwise end up doing it.))).\n- Enforcement works in abstraction and actuality without physical enforcement in almost all cases: Beliefs of consequence of act trade-off.\n- Public opinion shifts to adaption of systems and new ways of \"having things happen and in orderly fashion\" etc.\n- Political adaptation follows, or if it doesn't stubborn holding onto or clinging to power as the world leaves them behind.\n\n## Implementation Strategies\n\n### Start Where There's Pain\n\n**High-Value Early Targets**:\n- Medical refugees seeking healing; This is again a \"High-leverage Actor\" opportunity. Function as actualizational layer, in terms of match-making/headhunting and funding the original \"Hospitals and Hospitaleers\" sparsely around the world; or medical ships or other logistics, that moves high-end expensive equipment around the world to provide for treatment of persons. \"A sort of daemonic overlap and community in that calling; at the very least will-coalescence concerning it\". Alternatively, funding of such a thing: A \"city of healing\", where the sick are flown to, and where persons live there not for pay and universal command (money), but because the life there is fulfilling and meaningful and eudaimonic and full of persons they truly enjoy spending their lives with and doing both recreational and professional work with. The scalable and cheap financing of getting things done.\n- Creators escaping gatekeepers\n- Communities wanting autonomy\n- Innovators hitting regulatory walls\n\n**Clear Value Propositions**:\n- \"Find healing outside the system\"\n- \"Sell directly to your true fans\"\n- \"Build the community you want\"\n- \"Create without permission\"\n\n### Network Effect Acceleration\n\n**Metcalfe's Law Application**:\n- Each new user adds value for all\n- Focus on dense local networks first\n- Bridge high-value clusters\n- Create discovery mechanisms\n\n**Viral Mechanics**:\n- Success stories spread naturally\n- Trust networks share discoveries\n- Will coalescence creates belonging\n- Exit from old system proves possible\n\n### Resource Requirements\n\n**Initial Funding** ($10-50M):\n- Core protocol development\n- Initial community building\n- Proof of concept projects\n- Documentation and education\n\n**Growth Capital** ($100M-1B):\n- Infrastructure deployment\n- Market formation support\n- Sovereignty experiments\n- Regulatory navigation\n\n**Self-Sustaining** (Year 5+):\n- Transaction fees fund development\n- Successful zones support system\n- High-leverage actors contribute\n- Network value creates resources\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**Single Points of Failure**:\n- Distributed architecture\n- Multiple implementations\n- Open source foundations\n- Community ownership\n\n**Scalability Challenges**:\n- Layer 2 solutions ready\n- Efficient routing protocols\n- Local-first architecture\n- Progressive decentralization\n\n### Social Risks\n\n**Bad Actor Infiltration**:\n- Trust consequences compound\n- Network naturally excludes\n- Exit rights prevent capture\n- Transparency reveals truth\n\n**Cultural Resistance**:\n- Start with receptive communities\n- Demonstrate clear benefits\n- Allow voluntary adoption\n- Respect those who don't join\n\n### Regulatory Risks\n\n**Government Crackdowns**:\n- Distributed resilience\n- Multiple jurisdictions\n- Encrypted foundations\n- Popular support defense\n\n**Corporate Resistance**:\n- Superior user experience\n- Direct value creation\n- Network effect power\n- Inevitable obsolescence\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Quantitative\n\n**Adoption Metrics**:\n- Active users with PoP\n- Trust network connections\n- Utility confirmations daily\n- Sovereignty experiments active\n\n**Value Metrics**:\n- Gatekeeper market share loss\n- Direct exchange volume\n- Trust Networked indebtedness metrics (which could be 1d initially; again stepping stones towards WE topologies that can replace money if it is willed) The money that has meaning becoming currency in increasing circulation (The Money Means \"Has provided willed, intented and so fulfilled goods and services for persons (within friend-distinction?)\" (Note ownership is often in the way. What ))\n- Will coalescence success rate\n\n### Qualitative\n\n**Life Improvement**:\n- Healing outside medical and especially medicament system\n- Creating without gatekeepers\n- Finding resonant community\n- Living chosen values\n\n**System Health**:\n- Diverse experiments thriving\n- Natural selection visible\n- Language evolving rapidly\n- Exit rights exercised freely\n\n## The Path Forward\n\n**Month 1-6**: Decentralized attempts at Core team assembly, initial funding, protocol development\n**Month 6-12**: First communities, basic features, trust network seed\n**Year 2**: Local success stories, utility proof, network growth\n**Year 3**: Regional expansion, market formation, sovereignty tests\n**Year 5**: Critical mass approached, old system disruption, new world visible\n**Year 10**: Parallel worlds established, natural selection operating, humanity transforming\n\nAnd it could all unfold in a few years. Or in a hundred years. Who knows.\n\nThe roadmap is not rigid but adaptive. Each phase learns from the previous, adjusting based on what works. The only constant is the vision: infrastructure for will manifestation, trust replacing force, discovery replacing prescription, and humanity's full diversity finally able to express itself.\n\nSuccess comes not from perfect execution but from unleashing human creativity within trust networks. Build the foundation, demonstrate the value, and let humanity manifest its will.\n\n---\n\n*For technical details, see [Architecture](../3%20technical_architecture.md) and [Protocol documents](../24%20nss.md).

Echo versus added Trusted Beliefs beyond Trust Transitivity from Witnessing PoPs/nodes.\n- Mature network structure\n\n**Clustered Networks**:\n- Dense local connections\n- Sparse bridge connections\n- Cultural preservation\n- Natural emergence pattern\n\n**Scale-Free Networks**:\n- Power law distribution\n- Super-connectors exist\n- Efficient but unequal; also simply true in terms of the reality of trustworthiness in persons -- as it stands. They provide massive utility and foundational power that the system functions upon.\n- Market dynamics create\n\n### Economic Value of Trust\n\n**Trust Reduces Transaction Costs**:\n- No verification needed: -90% overhead (Say, a state with citizens that trust it, could in the old world, automatically do all authentication and authorization for them without ever having to have logins or passwords or anything like that. Similarly, in the case of Trusted Nodes who can act with their authentication and authorization.)\n- No contract enforcement required, sometimes not even a contract beyond utility expectation, or intent of utility provided: -95% legal costs (The cost from any individual supplier or consumer is much greater if suffering reputational effects in large Trust Networks for almost all trades/acts/interactions)\n- Direct exchange possible: -100% intermediary fees\n- Instant settlement: -99% time cost (Settlement is, disentanglement and future tit-for-tat; No need for punishment in almost all cases: remembering and having empowered transitivity of act possible; while good reputation handling through Trust Networks functioning. Then that is the punishment or settlement. Divergence and disentanglement. Ultimately, \"as if they didn't exist\" dead to their world. Banished and disjoint in actuality. Often merely: WE of WM through such bad actor is much more costly and risky. Therefore generally much worse ability to WM.)\n\n**Trust Enables New Markets**:\n- Micro-transactions viable; or local book-keeping with batch or acc updating. Or things like \"open-taking of goods with honor system book-keeping and payment back when suitable time\" and no security or cashiers. (In case you think that sounds naively utopian or something: it was standard in most places of scandinavia 30 years ago -- Except in the capital shities or near immigrant communities) You do the math of cost-reduction when you have a small store but need no security features nor cashiers/employees - but merely drop the goods in the store for customers to buy and pay in honor full and properly. I.e. \"small-scale anything\" is much cheaper in high-trust world. (\"Oh you want to borrow our super computer? Go ahead.\" or \"Oh you want to borrow my house while I'm on vacation?\" or \"Oh you want to stay in the office building day and night while you work on a project?\" and so on. With trust utility and economy can be efficient. Anyway, Scandinavia is Bureaucratic low trust now. And they assess everything through very low-dimensional perspectives on persons and demand supposed \"EQUALITY\" when those metrics or categories are equal. I.e. They insist to be blind to anything and everything else than what they measure; They call it evil if you are not as it isn't equality/ligestilling: Systematic Blindness. Blindness by system design. (All the West does this. It is simply Dismal Science legacy applied as \"the holy grail of 'science'\". It has infested Academia and thus everything else.))\n- Quality guarantees inherent\n- Reputation as collateral\n- Future value tradeable\n\n**Trust Network Market Cap**:\nWhat does it mean to have \"value creation\", why should you care:\n- \"Value Creation\" is the idea of having added some sort of market-price increase or \"created\" something that is market-priced above 0. This \"creation\" can be entirely fictional, not even paper, but mere bits in a computer that states it is there; then provided a \"value assessment\" by \"anyone\" who is willing to \"buy it\" or publish their valuation of it. Then, with that, you have \"created value\". These are the kind of numbers they use to navigate the health and status of their \"economy\" and their \"countries\". (They lie so much about wealth, that it has swallowed all real wealth in the metrics they use. You could have economy that is stellar in their metrics but entirely void of real wealth. An inventory list of real-material-wealth/items/objects/possessions/buildings/facilities/utility of the country would be much better statistics on wealth of the country. Raw counting would be better, than the lying name of \"value\" that includes all sorts of random person predictive \"value of abstractions or anything\")\n- Reduced overhead: $10T annually or maybe even WEEKLY!\n- New markets enabled: $20T annually disabled!\n- Innovation acceleration: $15T quarterly profits\n- Total: $88T+ annual value creation with extra spice\n\n### Predictive Dynamics in Each Utility; with focus not on performance but reliability or variance in performance. On potential human-to-human upsets that will break the patterns.\n\n**Computational Predicted Will-Utility**:\n- Hardware reliability scores\n- Data privacy practices\n- Computation accuracy\n- Resource sharing fairness\n\n**Health Prediction**:\n- Healing success rates\n- Practitioner empathy\n- Treatment safety\n- Outcome honesty\n\n**Food Prediction**:\n- Production transparency\n- Quality consistency\n- Health outcomes\n- Ethical practices\n\n**Energy Prediction**:\n- Delivery reliability\n- Source authenticity\n- Price stability\n- Grid contribution\n\n### Trust Network Attack Vectors\n\n**Sybil Attacks**:\n- *Prevented by*: PoP requirements\n- *Cost*: Must fool witnesses and build pseudonym (machine id human mapping) strength again and again through interactions. Very hard to do massified pseudonyms with any human-like-life-witnessed strength. (You can do Monero style anonymity \"witness coin sent to adress\" as a naive but anonymous adding to pseudonym by human to human non-anonymity witnessing/encountering/moving-past of each other)\n- *Detection*: Network analysis\n- *Recovery*: Excise false nodes\n\n**Reputation Farming**:\n- *Method*: Small good acts, one big betrayal\n- *Prevention*: Humans to learn that \"acts are not being\". And that trust is about Being. Unfortunately you can not avoid betrayal other than trusting the right \"honourable\" persons. Persons of Honor and integrity. Outstanding Character. :P\n- *Detection*: Behavior analysis\n- *Response*: Historical weighting\n\n**Trust Injection**:\n- *Method*: Buy or steals high-trust \"account\" (cryptographic box of theirs).\n- *Prevention*: Outstanding Trust Networks is perhaps a long discovery journey and one of pruning many elements and reducing your Trust of Trust. In terms of stealing: Horns. Pwnership. \nBoth are civilizational attacks on you. That foundation or substrate in which you function.\n- *Detection*: \n  1. Human-ID PoP persons will have PoP Witness generate instant divergence of Witness data and Human-Data. (This method provides most safety in keeping ownership and preventing exchange of ID. Instant detection of lying by PoP system.)\n  2. Pseudonymity version: Trust Network exists at some level in mutual Trust. Which includes any recursion on trust of trust. Therefore, it \"ought to\" account for keeping eyes on node-being-who-they-claim-to-be. These things can be cryptographically locked in or mutual surveillence or \"pwnership\" in some way that allows for \"certainty\". Ultimately, the selling is proof of their untrustworthiness (both of them), and so, it is a bad Trust Network or high trust: The wrong person to trust. Social hacking and engineering simply is an opsec part that is hard. But at least here it is very explicit who you decide to trust in any action or choice.\n- *Response*: Trust decay on anomaly\n\n**Network Fragmentation**:\n- *Method*: Create conflicting information\n- *Prevention*: Multi-path verification\n- *Response*: Your best-belief mechanisms. It is all individual level ultimately.\n- *Result*: Natural civilization split\n\n### Emergent Trust Phenomena\n\n**Trust Cascades**:\nSmall trust changes can cascade:\n- Key node loses trust\n- Dependent nodes affected\n- Network reconfigures\n- New equilibrium emerges\n\n**Trust Crystallization**:\nLiquid trust becomes solid:\n- Repeated confirmations\n- Network consensus forms\n- Trust becomes \"fact\"\n\n### Trust Network Governance\n\n**No Central Authority**:\n- Trust emerges from interactions\n- No governance body needed\n- Market dynamics rule\n- Natural selection operates\n\n**Dispute**:\n- Multiple path verification\n- Real investigation\n- Real experimentation\n- Trust Network changes and consequences no matter what\n\n**Protocol Evolution**:\n- Success patterns spread\n- Failed patterns abandoned\n- Continuous adaptation\n- Emergent optimization\n\n### The Trust Singularity\n\nWhen trust networks reach high-quality:\n- Information perfectly routed\n- Value frictionlessly flows\n- Deception doesn't really happen \n- Collaboration exponentiates\n- Human against human obstacles mostly removed: E.g. Ownership causing low utility gone.\n\n**Network Intelligence**:\nThe network makes every member much more intelligent than without it:\n- Collective memory\n- Predictive routing\n- Pattern recognition\n- Wisdom emergence\n\n**Trust as Fundamental Force**:\nLike electromagnetism or gravity:\n- Shapes economic space\n- Creates social fields\n- Removes the need for most complex human-to-human structures (including governance, many corporations like insurance and much more)\n- Empowers civilization\n\n### Practical Trust Building\n\n**For Individuals**:\n1. Start with small commitments\n2. Always confirm utility honestly\n3. Build diverse connections\n4. Bridge different networks\n5. Maintain consistency\n\n**For Organizations**:\n1. Radical transparency (When you can't be trusted as persons. Then you need to be open about everything you do. This is why as you become leader at larger scales you probably need much more openness much less privacy to be Trusted (Open about strengths and faults and everything inbetween) or simply believed sufficient little room for shady business.)\n2. Forget about metrics; Do what you are and want to be.\n3. Customer empowerment\n4. Network participation\n5. Long-term thinking\n\n**For Communities**:\n1. Seed high-trust cores\n2. Enable easy verification\n3. Celebrate bridge builders\n4. Share discoveries freely\n5. Protect exit rights\n\n### The Future of Trust\n\nTrust networks will become:\n- The primary economic infrastructure\n- More valuable than money\n- Basis of all organization\n- Foundation of civilization\n- Enabler of human potential\n\nNot through force or law, but through the simple recognition that **trust is the most efficient coordinating mechanism ever discovered**. It requires no enforcement because it is self-enforcing. It needs no governance because it is self-governing. When does it demand no sacrifice but only creates pure benefit?\n\nThe trust network is not built - it grows. Not designed - it emerges. Not controlled - it flows. And in its flow, it carries humanity toward its highest potential.\n\n---\n\n*For mathematical models, see [Blob Classes](../4%20blob_classes_discovery.md).

But they can exist totally individual all the way to strictly enforced by the game. Like normal software or games now.\n**Hard Boundaries**:\n- Complete segregation\n- No cross-phase awareness\n- Separate interaction spaces\n- Independent physics\n\n**Soft Boundaries**:\n- Partial awareness allowed\n- Filtered interaction possible\n- Graduated transitions\n- Consensual crossing\n\nHowever, all should deal with fundamental Triad rule/protocols, which we hope Planetary (due to MBC entails) would be that they all switch to emergency-solving/coordination-game upon emergencies.\n**Emergency Overrides**:\n- Emergency punch-through\n- Disaster warnings break-through \n- Safety alerts cross-phase\n- Massive coordination of all persons simultaneously, to for a moment be guided to do and act (with Aiddaemonic disclosure to Trust Network bridging to \"authority\" or emergency dealing actors) such that the emergency is dealt with in the most resourceful way - including all persons available there or not. But for many it would simply mean navigating them \"out of the way\": Per person \"optimal\"/coordinated \"Exit paths\" visible.\n\n## Interaction Protocols\n\n### Cross-Phase Communication\nLLL intra- and inter-game cross-phase virtual-info-flow.\nCould have some made in the following ways.

Heidegger - Thrownness and Transformative Leadership\n\n## Being Thrown Into Pre-Existing Conditions\n\n### The Fundamental Predicament\n\nMartin Heidegger identified the human condition as **Geworfenheit** - thrownness. We are thrown into:\n- A world we didn't create\n- Economic systems already in motion\n- Social hierarchies pre-established\n- Limited choices all leading to similar traps\n- Collective races to the bottom\n\n### Modern Manifestations of Thrownness\n\n**The Housing Trap**:\n\"Just work harder\" they say, while everyone competes to indebt themselves for 30 years for basic shelter. The willing participants create a gradient where not participating means homelessness. Individual discipline cannot solve collective thrownness.\n\n**The Poisoning Matrix**:\n- Microplastics in every body\n- Attention parasites everywhere\n- Ugliness as default architecture\n- Isolation as standard condition\n- No individual escape from collective poisoning\n\n**The False Solutions**:\n- \"Better discipline\" - while surrounded by addiction dealers\n- \"Work harder\" - in races to the bottom\n- \"Make better choices\" - when all choices are trap variants\n- \"Be positive\" - in environments designed for depression\n\n### The Absence of Transformative CEOs\n\nHeidegger recognized that breaking collective thrownness requires what we might call **high-leverage CEOs** - visionary leaders capable of reshaping the entire landscape. \n\nWithout such transformative figures:\n- Collective suffering compounds\n- Desperate populations accept anyone promising change\n- The gradient toward degradation steepens\n- Individual virtue becomes meaningless\n\n### Historical Case Study: The Weimar Predicament\n\nIn 1920s-30s Germany, economic thrownness created desperation. When a charismatic CEO figure emerged promising to break this thrownness - let's call him **Idolf Hatler** of the **Dritkult Ritte** movement - Heidegger saw philosophical validation of his theories.\n\nThis CEO promised to:\n- Break the economic chains binding Germans\n- Create new possibilities beyond Weimar thrownness  \n- Manifest a particular vision with total commitment\n- Transform rather than compromise\n\nHeidegger's support wasn't arbitrary - it emerged from recognizing that **only powerful transformative forces can break collective thrownness**.\n\n### The Monopoly Problem\n\nWhat made the Dritkult Ritte catastrophic wasn't the CEO structure itself but:\n- **Territorial monopoly** - no competing visions allowed\n- **No exit rights** - attempting to leave meant death\n- **Forced expansion** - imposing vision on unwilling populations\n- **Top-down enforcement** - rather than bottom-up attraction\n\nThe CEO became dangerous precisely because he operated in a monopolistic nation-state system where:\n- Alternative visions were criminalized\n- Exit was forbidden\n- Expansion was through conquest\n- Consent was manufactured not genuine\n\n### The Crucible Solution\n\nThe system transforms what was dangerous into what creates diversity:\n\n**Multiple CEOs Competing**:\nInstead of one national CEO, thousands of sovereignty CEOs each:\n- Manifesting their unique vision\n- Attracting voluntary followers\n- Creating authentic alternatives\n- Competing through excellence\n\n**Higher-Order Consent**:\n- Choose which CEO to follow\n- Like selecting a company to work for\n- Full commitment while aboard\n- Sacred right to resign and leave\n\n**Natural Boundaries**:\n- CEOs can only expand through attraction\n- Trust networks reveal actual outcomes\n- Exit rights prevent exploitation\n- Competition ensures quality\n\n### Why CEO Structures Become Essential\n\n**For Breaking Thrownness**:\n- Collective problems need collective solutions\n- Individual virtue insufficient against systemic traps\n- Transformative vision requires concentrated will\n- Someone must dare to paint different colors\n\n**For Creating Diversity**:\nWhen thousands of CEOs each paint their authentic vision:\n- Real alternatives emerge\n- Genuine choice becomes possible\n- Every temperament finds its match\n- Humanity's spectrum expresses\n\n**For Enabling Greatness**:\n- Compromise creates mediocrity\n- Committee rule dilutes vision\n- Democracy averages into gray\n- CEO structure allows bold manifestation\n\n### The Will to Transform\n\nWhat Heidegger glimpsed but couldn't fully articulate: the **will to transform** thrownness is sacred. It requires:\n- Visionaries willing to create alternatives\n- Followers willing to commit fully\n- Systems allowing multiple experiments\n- Exit rights preventing tyranny\n\nThe Dritkult Ritte tragedy occurred because one transformative will claimed monopoly over all space. The Crucible enables millions of transformative wills to each claim their portion, creating:\n- A mosaic not a monolith\n- A garden not a desert\n- A symphony not a single note\n- Options not obligations\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n**For Individuals**:\n- Stop trying to escape thrownness alone\n- Seek transformative leaders resonating with your will\n- Commit fully to chosen experiments\n- Exercise exit rights when needed\n\n**For Leaders**:\n- Dare to manifest uncompromising visions\n- Attract through excellence not force\n- Accept the sovereignty of other visions\n- Build depth not breadth\n\n**For Systems**:\n- Enable competitive CEO structures\n- Guarantee exit rights absolutely\n- Let natural selection operate\n- Celebrate successful experiments\n\n### The Beautiful Paradox\n\nWhat seemed dangerous in monopolistic contexts becomes essential in pluralistic ones. The same CEO energy that created catastrophe in nation-states creates diversity in the Crucible. \n\nNot despite strong leadership but because of it. Not through preventing CEOs but by enabling thousands. Not through compromise but through uncompromising visions competing.\n\nHeidegger was right that breaking thrownness requires transformative leadership. He was wrong only in accepting monopolistic expression. The Crucible vindicates his insight while preventing his error.\n\n### Beyond Thrownness\n\nIn the new world:\n- **Thrownness becomes choice** - select which world to be thrown into\n- **CEOs become options** - choose your transformative leader\n- **Visions become realities** - uncompromising manifestation\n- **Diversity becomes genuine** - authentic difference not superficial variety\n\nThe child born into the Crucible world faces not one thrownness but thousands of throws to choose from. Not one CEO claiming total authority but thousands offering distinct paths. Not gray compromise but vivid colors.\n\nThis is how humanity transcends thrownness - not through individual escape but through collective creation of alternatives. Not through preventing strong leadership but through enabling competitive leadership. Not through forced unity but through chosen association.\n\nThe will to transform, when given proper outlets, creates the rich tapestry of human possibility. What Heidegger sought in one movement, we find in thousands. What seemed to require monopoly actually requires plurality.\n\nWelcome to the world beyond thrownness - where being thrown becomes the first of many choices.\n\n---\n\n*For system architecture enabling this, see [The Crucible](../17%20crucible_sovereignty_system.md).

By replacing capital's universal command with domain-specific performance measurement, NSS enables a new form of economic and social organization where excellence in one domain doesn't grant control over others. This comprehensive analysis explores how brutal competition within domains creates holistic optimization across civilization, demonstrating why apparent harshness generates kindness, and how zero-sum battles deliver positive-sum outcomes for humanity.\n\nThrough detailed examination of the Actualization Layer, trust network dynamics, merit protection mechanisms, and incentive structures aligned with human nature, we present a complete framework for understanding how NSS transforms employment into functions, corporations into evolutionary organisms, and static infrastructure into continuously evolving systems. Crucially, we show how human work transforms rather than disappears\u2014shifting from gatekeeping to the vital tasks of trust network building, witnessing, and cross-community connection that enable the entire system to function. We demonstrate how this protocol enables exponential growth for performers while preventing parasitic extraction, creates antifragile trust networks that strengthen through betrayal, and ultimately drives infrastructure costs toward zero while unleashing unprecedented human potential.\n\nThis work synthesizes technical architecture, economic theory, social dynamics, and philosophical foundations to present NSS not as a mandated system but as a competitive alternative that natural selection itself will choose. Through detailed examples\u2014from fast food disruption where ethical craft can finally compete with industrial scale, to prophet algorithms achieving negative latency\u2014we demonstrate how performance-based selection creates abundance while respecting human values. The future belongs not to those who control the most, but to those who perform the best in their chosen domains.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.

Introduction: The Catastrophic Inefficiency of Capital Command {#introduction}\n\n### 1.1 The Universal Delusion\n\nModern civilization operates on a fundamental lie that creates catastrophic inefficiencies across every domain of human activity. This lie is simple: that accumulating capital through any means grants legitimate command over all domains of human endeavor. \n\nConsider the absurdity this creates:\n- A hedge fund manager who perfected high-frequency trading algorithms now controls critical healthcare infrastructure\n- An heir to a mining fortune directs educational policy for millions\n- A social media monopolist determines food distribution systems\n- A master of regulatory capture commands energy infrastructure\n- [Insert some 'Rich Person' and some domain they can command/supply or disproportionately affects the demand of. Who are the Captains of Civilization?]\n- Lil Tay / Sophie Rain or Beyonc\u00e9 or Arnold or whoever else it may be. (Demand money flow is what? Who spends the money that the suppleirs blindly try to follow or predict or manufacture with advertisement and other 'story telling')\n- Or the masses of persons spending their money on what? And Why? Multiple Choices of..? Recent trend of what..? Unopinionated: Who? What? Why?\n\nThis system commits a catastrophic category error by collapsing all forms of competence into a single dimension: monetary accumulation. It assumes that excellence in wealth extraction qualifies one for universal command, regardless of domain-specific knowledge or performance capability.\n\n### 1.2 The Scale of Inefficiency\n\nThe current system's inefficiencies manifest in multiple ways:\n\n**Resource Misallocation**: Those who command resources often lack the competence to use them effectively. A brilliant engineer who could revolutionize energy distribution remains subordinate to financiers who understand nothing of the domain. The same boring allocation of \"teams\" and \"substrates\" persists. There isn't a dynamic flow of competitions across substrates and persons creating the many \"teams\".\n\n**Innovation Suppression**: Employment contracts ensure that innovations belong to capital owners rather than creators. This destroys the incentive for breakthrough thinking, as the innovator captures minimal value from their creation. Often, if corporate wing of their employer is too disagreeable to them, they break out into their own company, where they will be positioned very poorly to compete - despite in this scenario being the merit of their business beyond ownership - having to struggle with \"societal\" and \"capital\" technicalities; as well as \"starting up\". That is, if they're lucky to be able to find capital willing to finance them. TL;DR Innovation suppresion: Take Bad Deal Xor Start from Scratch and be stuck in low-capital (acquisition of the materials and tools and \"distribution logistics\" (like paying the attention/information-flow mafia and advertisement and so on)) and law hell (as well as starting over).\n\n**No-sense Narrow-minded Money Optimized Artificial Scarcity**: Capital owners maintain profitability through restriction rather than abundance. Empty buildings, idle compute resources, and restricted access create scarcity where none is willed to exist.\n\n**Parasitic Load**: Multiple layers of 'rent extraction' exist between value creation and value consumption. Each layer adds cost without adding value, creating a massive parasitic load on productive activity.\n\n### 1.3 The Natural Selection Alternative\n\nThe Natural Selection Protocol corrects this fundamental error by ensuring efficiency control and utilization flow to those who demonstrate performance in specific domains. Excellence in one area grants no authority over others. The teenager with superior routing algorithms commands network infrastructure. The village collective with better energy management powers regions. The healer with proven success treats patients.\n\nThis isn't merely fairer\u2014it's more intelligent. Resources flow to those who use them best, not those who accumulated the most capital through unrelated activities.\n\n### 1.4 Document Overview\n\nThis comprehensive analysis presents NSS as a complete civilizational operating system. We examine:\n- The technical architecture enabling domain-specific evolution\n- The death of employment and rise of performance-based functions\n- Trust networks replacing contracts and regulation\n- Zero-sum competition creating positive-sum outcomes\n- Merit protection preventing innovation theft\n- Incentive structures aligned with human nature\n- The exponential growth dynamics of the system\n- Real-world implementation strategies\n- The philosophical foundations of will-based organization\n\nWe demonstrate that NSS doesn't require universal adoption or mandate. Instead, it creates a competitive environment where performance-based systems naturally outcompete extraction-based systems. Unlike democracy's false promise of majority representation through representatives who serve party agendas, NSS enables true will expression through voluntary association. The future selects itself.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Theoretical Foundations: Natural Selection as Civilizational OS {#theoretical-foundations}\n\n### 2.1 The Core Principle\n\nNatural selection operates on a simple principle: what works better proliferates while what works worse diminishes. This principle, which drove biological evolution for billions of years, can be consciously applied to human infrastructure, governance, and social organization.\n\nThe key insight: by creating systems where performance directly determines resource flow, we enable continuous evolution toward optimality without central planning or design.\n\n### 2.2 Domain-Specific Selection\n\nUnlike biological evolution which operates on whole organisms, civilizational evolution can operate on specific functions within domains. This enables:\n\n**Specialized Excellence**: A person or system can excel in packet routing without claiming competence in healthcare. But will have a testing ground to \"try healthcare out\"; To easily see if there exists an edge expressible by the person granting exponential growth potential without any artificial limiters turning it needlessly into a 'logsitic' tapering.\n\n**Parallel Evolution**: Multiple domains evolve simultaneously in symbiotic interference. Multiple millions of \"variants\" exists at any given moment ready to grow exponentially where it can find its utility niche. (This is the responsiveness needed for catastrophe solutions)\n\n**Rapid Adaptation**: Changes in one domain don't require restructuring others. In fact, changes in one domain, simply causes environment in which \"a variant\" in another domain sits or acts in. If the interaction is high and the change profound: It can cause a shift in which variants do best or better in another domain; Instantly growth changes; Subsequently proliferation state changes.\n\n**Preserved Diversity**: Different approaches can coexist and compete without unnecessary \"guarding\" or \"human dispute walling off\". Unlimited number of variants can exist in digital/theorized/written domain and be \"tried\" at random or intelligently in total substrate and allowed growing according to performance. (See [Discovery OS](../25%20discovery-os-expanded-into-broader-picture.md) or ForthOs perhaps for details on substrate robustness and discovering being any substrate's main outlook (Subaiddaemon wrapped))\n\n### 2.3 The Continuous Qualification System\n\nTraditional systems grant permanent control through ownership or employment. NSS grants transient command/control through continuous will-performance (See [Will Manifestation: Performance](../15%20will_manifestation_philosophy.md) (low-d metric space) we want Will-performance (will-economic considerations: \"all things considered\" to a daemon through Aiddaemon projecting subaiddaemons at all \"junctions\" or \"utility\" (o/p)wned by daemon)). This transforms infrastructure from static property to dynamic function.\n\nConsider the formula for iterative command:\n```\nE_n = E_(n-1) * Fitness_of_current_mutation\n```\n\nWhere:\n- E_n represents command/effect at iteration n\n- E_(n-1) represents accumulated position from history\n- Fitness represents current performance relative to alternatives\n\nThis ensures that yesterday's excellence can't rest on laurels\u2014continuous performance is required for continued command. (It offers \"geometric\" (discrete exponentional growth adjustment(Which is often necessary due to the domains: Think \"high-voltage power wiring and transformer stations\". They function fundamentally in iterative experimentation/development (Whereas, digital domain that runs on compute-substrate is able to grow at frequencies of what seem continuous to human eyes))))\n\n### 2.4 The Evolutionary Pressure Mechanism\n\nNSS creates evolutionary pressure through:\n\n**Performance Visibility**: All results are measurable and public within trust networks according to protocol agreements or raw will \"equilibrium points\" and Trust Maps. The more a \"network\" can open up to have \"utility\" of their \"material/substrate\" be NSS crucible grounds; the more innovative and efficient their substrate will be (Mutatis Mutandis \"Discovery OS\" robustness and having good Trust Mapping/Networks.)\n\n**Resource Flow**: Better performance automatically attracts more resources. (In fact, the default positions of not having employees, but instead NSS grounds would make raw will-economic considerations within a NSS protocol massively reroute at whatever speed possible to the \"most efficient\" (in the moment): NSS Protocols then makes it explicit how to make it robust and catastrophe preventative. (By e.g. ensuring many variants function/compete at the same time despite \"sub-optimality\" or \"reasonably-same-optimality\" able to \"improve their niche/edge/angle on the problem-domain\" and ready to grow at exponential/geometric rates or new stakes in new variants projected/built. This allows for long-term systematics of competition frameworks and natural selection to never become stagnant and unresponsive))\n\n**Competition Access**: Anyone can attempt to outperform current solutions.\n\n**Natural Consequences**: Poor performance leads to resource decay at exponential rates (responsiveness of \"that which takes over instead during fault\" (whatever it was that was able to deal with the situation (In Will-Performant manner))).\n\nThis pressure ensures continuous innovation, as standing still means being overtaken.\n\n### 2.5 System Properties\n\nWhen natural selection operates on infrastructure:\n\n**Efficiency Maximization**: Waste is selected against ruthlessly. You have \"utility\" of some sort. Why can't a will-economic equilibrium be had? Why can't your substrate/utility be efficient? Modern? Applying the newest or best \"variants\"?\n\n**Innovation Acceleration**: Better methods immediately gain resources.\n\n**Antifragility**: The system strengthens through stress and competition. It even strengthens by betrayal. In the very long game of life, it will be rock-solid.\n\n**Emergent Organization**: Order arises without central planning. (See [12. Will-Coalescence](../12%20will_coalescence_meta_utility.md))\n\n**Externality Integration**: Unlike traditional markets that ignore external costs, NSS makes all factors visible\u2014animal welfare, environmental impact, worker conditions\u2014allowing \"deep will intent\" to drive selection. A burger isn't just fast and cheap, but carries its full ethical weight in consumer choice.\n\n**True Representation**: Unlike democracy's fiction of representatives embodying constituent will, NSS enables continuous voting through life choices. Every action is a vote, every association a political statement, every purchase a policy decision. Will manifests directly rather than through supposed representatives.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Three-Layer Architecture and Actualization {#architecture}\n\n### 3.1 The Universal Pattern\n\nEvery system component in NSS follows a three-layer pattern that separates intent from implementation:\n\n**Layer 1: Intent/Architecture/Organism-Dream**\n- Pure expression of will and desire\n- What outcomes are sought\n- Domain-independent goals\n- Human creativity space\n\n**Layer 2: Reason/Logic/Theoretical-Variant**\n- Semantic transformations\n- Algorithms and patterns\n- Platform-agnostic solutions\n- Reusable methods\n\n**Layer 3: Actuator/Machine/Infrastructure/Variant/Substrate**\n- Physical implementation\n- Actual resource utilization\n- Hardware and networks\n- Material reality\n\n### 3.2 The Actualization Layer\n\nThe Actualization Layer is where natural selection operates, connecting abstract intent with physical resources through evolutionary competition. This layer:\n\n**Opens Infrastructure**: Instead of exclusive corporate control, infrastructure becomes accessible to anyone who can use it better.\n\n**Measures Performance**: Real-time measurement of efficiency, reliability, and value delivery. (Subaiddaemonic Wrapper having some Blob Class utility-function (Projected by Aiddaemon for \"all things considered\" what local Subaiddaemon should \"will economize\" or \"look for as efficient/cheap in its discovery process (Including Market or (sub)Aiddaemon-to-(sub)aiddaemon communication)\"))\n\n**Routes Resources**: Automatic flow of traffic/energy/data - substrate command/control - to best performers.\n\n**Enables Evolution**: Continuous competition for resource command. When NSS functions on all domains at once, then also whatever substrate or resource a variant is efficient utilizing for \"some will\", then all \"environments\" evolve while all domain \"organisms\" evolve as well. In massive parallel fashion and with all the niceties expressed throughout this documents, such as will-coalescent leverage and will-disentanglement of also \"externalities\" and much more.\n\n### 3.3 Example: Computational Discovery\n\nTraditional computing systems assume hardware configurations:\n```\nif (CPU == \"Intel\") load_intel_driver();\nelse if (CPU == \"AMD\") load_amd_driver();\n// Breaks with unknown hardware\n```\n\nNSS Discovery approach:\n```\n[PoP Compute Access to Try Variants in NSS Trust Network / Sea / Ocean NSS Pool]\ndiscovered_capabilities = probe_hardware();\ngenerated_code = create_variant_code_for(discovered_capabilities);\n[PoP Compute Owner Time Will-Performance]\nwill_performance_of_variant = ..\nevolution_cycle = protocol_constrained_improve_based_on(will_performance_of_variant);\n```\n\nThis enables:\n- Unknown hardware utilization; and \"instant utility of hardware if 'anyone' can utilize it in whatever degree it can: 50%? 100%?\".\n- Optimal code generation: Insane improvement of 'code efficiency' on devices. (Imagine all bloatware and old-compatibilities and so on, all eaten away in raw natural selection competition in being as will-economic as possible. You sleep at night? \"Okay, Wake-On-Lan boot into bare-metal computation utility mode of NSS protocol of some Trust circle (a spring? random selection of persons? Sea-wide? World-wide? Planetary?)\")\n- Continuous improvement\n- Emergent optimization (The massive combinatorial space of \"all the pieces fitting together\", well if it does, then it simply grows.. The end of refusing optimizations because it isn't human-comprehendable. Mantra: Human-Master instead of Human-Comprehendable.

The drive to maximize earnings naturally leads to breaking Amdahl's law constraints on parallelization. (Think every substrate/utility being able to do predictive computation or delivery as if a pipelined micro-coded cisc cpu)\n\n### 3.5 Mutation Persistence\n\nCritically, mutations never die\u2014they persist in Layer 2 (Logic) waiting for their moment:\n\n**Year 1**: Develop quantum routing algorithm (useless without quantum hardware)\n**Year 5**: Quantum hardware emerges\n**Instant**: Your dormant algorithm activates and dominates (See [Ownership/Pwnership and Lumen](./15%20will_manifestation_philosophy.md) throughout the documents: Trust Networks and Emergent Civilizations or emergent inter-civilization Worlds; Oceans and Worlds -- That which has to be \"another world\" on the Planet; Who Profits? Who gets the Laurels?)\n\nThis creates an ever-growing library of solutions waiting for their conditions, enabling instant adaptation when circumstances change.\n\n---\n\n## 4. From Employment to Functions: The Death of Jobs {#employment-to-functions}\n\n### 4.1 The Historical Artifact\n\nEmployment is a relatively recent human invention, arising from industrial organization needs. It bundles multiple inefficiencies:\n\n**Exclusive Control**: Employees can't improve systems they see inefficiencies in if it competes with their employer. Employees both occupy resources from other merit-havers in the domain to compete; and at the same time they are kept out of competiting in other resources/substrates.\n\n**Innovation Capture**: All improvements belong to the employer regardless of who created them. With most wealth being dispersed out into hoarding stashes and some spent on luxury life-styles or other domains: Rarely does it result in natural selection growth of what worked will-well.\n\n**Time-Based Compensation**: Payment for presence rather than performance. Performance of workers or owners is rarely subject to real competition: stability and security (the comfortable life: Able to have family, vacations, good social standing, sometimes fulfilling work and so on) is the deal they lure employees with. (See [chapters 9-12](./9%20electricity_routing_markets.md) and extrapolate on stability and security. As well as Daemonias (in scales) and extrema case of ARK project (You can't make them all \"do\", but you can \"fix the 'if - then' scenarios for all\"))\n\n**Artificial Hierarchies**: Authority from hot-hand position-history into shallow settling on person for position; rather than will-performance or will-competency.\n\n### 4.2 The Functional Alternative\n\nIn NSS, employment dissolves into functions:\n\n**Not**: \"I am a software engineer at Google\"\n**But**: \"I optimize packet routing (currently handling 15% of Northeast traffic) and dabble in local tasks of a myriad of things as I go about my lovely town or go travelling\"\n\n**Not**: \"I work for Cleveland Clinic\"\n**But**: \"I heal chronic pain.. I am a bit embarressed to say it out loud, but I keep being routed for solving such problems for persons at capacity that has led me to have a quite reliable cluster of about 1000 persons at any moment optimizing 'my person' bottleneck in healing-pathway predictions: They basically do all that isn't that X-Factor I apparently predictively bring. Also, I function as a general Trust Node across many Trust Networks, and my reliability or reason-to-trust-my-probability-of-solving or prediction-variance of using me is basically 100% or 0 respectively. Seemingly across any predictive network.\"\n\n### 4.3 The Function Portfolio\n\nEconomic life becomes a portfolio of emergent-predictive-functions from the 'any' but made possible through Trust Networks and tangible through PoP:\nPerhaps some will have a view that looks like this (Who knows):\n```yaml\nYour_Functions:\n  packet_routing:\n    current_share: 2.3%\n    trend: growing\n    trust_score: 91.2\n    daily_earnings: 847_tokens\n    \n  energy_optimization:\n    current_share: 0.1%\n    trend: stable\n    trust_score: 78.5\n    daily_earnings: 123_tokens\n    \n  chronic_pain_protocols:\n    current_share: 5.2%\n    trend: declining  # Someone found better method\n    trust_score: 88.9\n    daily_earnings: 1_243_tokens\n```\n\n### 4.4 Entry Without Permission\n\nTraditional employment:\n```\nWant job \u2192 Apply \u2192 Interview \u2192 Rejection likely \u2192 Maybe hired \u2192 Fixed role (Hire-Test-Recycle/hire is a very slow process and very sequential and conflated and poorly measured/understood)\n```\n\nNSS function creation:\n```\nSee inefficiency \u2192 Create improvement \u2192 Deploy minimum version \u2192 Performance speaks \u2192 Natural growth\n```\n\nNo interviews. No resumes. No HR departments gatekeeping entry. Performance creates position automatically.\n\n### 4.5 The Transformation of Human Work\n\nWhile traditional HR disappears, deeper human work emerges:\n\n**Trust Network Facilitation**:\n- Building bridges between different trust networks\n- Translating trust scores across domains; \"How To Inference Trust in a world where you simply can not know the many persons of Civilization well enough to understand risk, variance and performance\".\n- Creating soft-gradient exchange rates between network types (The tangibility and psychological nicety of having currencies or coins; Then still having will-economic modulations between daemonias or in total fluid gradience when dealing with others. (See [Money Replacement Document](../24%20nss.md): Why Money isn't needed. Oh wait. This document. The Many Tokens and Metrics and domain numbers each person can have. Instead of only one \"banana coin\" number. I mean \"universal command and success and wealth-bestowing-proxy\" number: $$$))\n- Facilitating reputation portability: \"He is a really outstanding guy! You certainly can hire him to do that!\" But with machine-advantage and with Aiddaemon-human-wedge into it. With evolving and converging Trust Network structures of how to really trust such a statement and its nebulous blob class predictive equivalent.\n\n**Human Connection Architecture**:\n```\nTraditional HR: Block people from jobs. Use proxies only to settle upon a candidate to be tested or tried through employment.\nNSS Human Work: Connect people to opportunities: Usually that means \"Why trust enough for you to even begin growth in that NSS Sphere\"\n\nTraditional HR: Judge credentials; No matter what kind of person it otherwise is. What is the \"all things considered\" effect? What about the potential black-swan events. What about times of great upheaval or internal/otherwise discord and strife? Sometimes they factor in ulterior motives or corporate policies. \nLike apple: \"Not afraid to say that our values drive our curation decisions. There is no time to get tied up in knots. That\u2019s why we only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division and violence: You have no place on our platforms\"\nCEO Tim Cook delivered a message to white supremacists in a speech in front of the Anti-Defamation League: \u201cYou have no place on our platforms.\u201d\nWhich is exactly the kind of will-performance or will-economics that will be in play with this system. But instead of HR doing it, then (o/p)wners and will of any single person as described in earlier sections.\nAs they say in the show Silicon Valley season 3: \"We're left with these candidates because obvious alt-right guy and pretty sure closeted alt-right guy applied: Need not apply\".\nNSS Human Work: Witness actual task-solving PoU. Will-economics have been predicted, then a will-economic equilibrium is reached with some work-done-between them. That work is the visible utility which is PoU witnessed in high-variance-trust worlds. Low trust probably do Trustless or automatic Witnessing only or courts and equal before the law with lawsuits etc. Whereas, high trust need not do a thing, if ever betrayed cost is massive by exclusion from high-trust world. And in high-variance-trust (which is boostrap state) then PoU is massive utility. Especially with strategic or random witnessing of utility as a threat to push trust or variance-in-prediction of utility of using a PoP-slave-system. (See [Gold Standard Trust Nodes](../20%20trust_network_dynamics.md) offering such services)\n\nTraditional HR: Manage employee files\nNSS Human Work: Nurture trust relationships\n```\n\n**The New Human Professions**:\n- **Trust Translators**: Help reputation flow between networks\n- **PoP Witnesses**: Verify human uniqueness through presence\n- **PoU Confirmers**: Validate actual value delivery\n- **Connection Weavers**: Build trust bridges across communities\n- **Reputation Architects**: Design trust gradient systems\n\nThis work is immensely valuable because trust infrastructure enables everything else. Without trust networks, NSS would collapse into chaos. The human element becomes MORE important, not less - it just serves connection rather than gatekeeping.\n\n### 4.6 Income as Water\n\nInstead of salary, income flows like water based on value creation:\n\n- Route 1M packets efficiently \u2192 Micro-payment per packet (will-equilibrium across domains of desire or intent of will-impact. Sometimes it is reduced to 1-d currency exchange)\n- Heal chronic condition \u2192 Payment from value created (It is quite immeasurable what \"good will\" might be had by curing \"the right persons\" who have the decency to be appreciative of it with no strings attached. Healing can quite literally be \"free\" in the sense that only the \"voluntary and authentic good-will earned suffices as payment\". Not that it will. But it may. It can. That is, beyond raw altruism priority queue of according to will/intent. You also have \"payment with pay\" by \"their nature/character would grant massive good-will\". Then finally beyond that: raw will-economics. And in its sad blind form: raw money exchange for service. Gradient pay/cost due to broader or even holistic scoped reality and love-biasing in altruism)\n- Optimize energy flow \u2192 Earnings from efficiency gained\n- Distribute food optimally \u2192 Compensation from waste reduced\n\nIncome directly correlates with value delivered, measured continuously.\n\n### 4.6 The Corporate Structure Dissolution\n\nNSS eliminates:\n- Org charts (functions self-organize)\n- Job descriptions (reality defines scope; any action and interaction is will-of-others influential; Thus will-economic. \"I cut down a tree in this forest yesterday!\" \"I stayed in my bed for three weeks doing nothing\". Anything has impact. Often in absence of other acts. Thus using the system to fulfill your will in a will-coalescent becomes positive-sum and very high utility very easily. Almost, anyone, can 'earn their living' without thought of \"how\" it serves anyone else: Because their will can be \"entangled\" or interweaved in a coalescent fashion that provides value or utility. Of course, there is the exceptions, those in their own phases due to things like wanting to be treated like a God by all. (This is hard to phase-align or interweave in will-manifestation) or say the person who wants to rape, beat and murder all the time.. It is probably not something that is very will-coalescent, in fact, it is probably something that is both hard-line avoided by Crucible Triads and having massive will-disentangling will-economic effects upon.)\n- Performance reviews (continuous measurement and adaptations: Measurement without Discovery is bad. It is like measuring a drop of water a few places at the shore of the ocean instead of exploring the ocean.)\n- Promotion cycles (growth is organic)\n- Departmental budgets (resources flow naturally)\n- Meeting requests (coordination emerges)\n- Corporate politics (performance overrides; Corporate is Co-operation which is what NSS enables in a much more fluid and dynamic and responsive and coordinated across the civilization manner.) \n\nWhat remains is pure function: those who perform better command more resources in their domain.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Trust Networks: The New Neural System {#trust-networks}\n\n### 5.1 Trust as Infrastructure\n\nTrust networks in NSS aren't merely social connections\u2014they're the core infrastructure enabling:\n\n**Information Flow**: Discoveries, warnings, and opportunities propagate through trust connections.\n\n**Resource Routing**: High-trust paths get priority for packets, energy, and value transfer. (Human-element unpredictability (by betrayal? By anything?). Human-variability. Predictive-variance-of-predicted-pathway)\n\n**Reputation Consequences**: Actions affect trust scores with permanent memory.\n\n**Collective Intelligence**: Network learns faster than individuals. Network allows for NSS protocols to be implemented across substrate. Allowing for a system to bring forth whatever is the smartest combination of all their edges in will-economic symbiosis.\n\n### 5.2 Proof of Person (PoP)\n\nPoP establishes human uniqueness without revealing identity:\n\n```\nPhysical_Witness + Time + Multiple_Confirmations + ... (All that is 'human' versus 'non-human') = Personhood_Proof\n```\n\nThis prevents:\n- Sybil attacks (fake multiple identities is hard. Handful of identities possible, with consequences of faking human-uniqueness per pseudonym with massive consequences across identities and in perpetuity (according to each person and Trust network effects))\n- Bot infiltration\n- Identity farming\n- Trust manipulation\n\nWhile enabling:\n- Pseudonymous participation\n- Privacy preservation\n- Reputation portability\n- Cross-domain trust\n\n### 5.3 Proof of Utility (PoU)\n\nPoU verifies actual value delivery:\n\n```python\ndef verify_utility(provider, service, recipient):\n    if not has_pop(recipient):\n        return False  # Only real humans can verify\n    \n    actual_delivery = recipient.confirm_received(service)\n    value_assessment = recipient.assess_value()\n    \n    return {\n        'delivered': actual_delivery,\n        'value': value_assessment,\n        'timestamp': now(),\n        'trust_impact': calculate_trust_change()\n    }\n```\n\nThis creates ungameable verification of real value delivery.\n\n### 5.4 (Conflated) Trust Network Dynamics (TODO: explode all usage of trust in these documents to remove conflation. Neologism or some greek word or smt. Agathos or smt.)\n\nPotential Trust Networks dynamics:\n\n**Transitivity**: A trusts B, B trusts C \u2192 A has some trust path to C. If anonymized as B then having C work on it, you could \"perhaps\" use C with B-to-C trust.\n\n**Decay**: Unused trust relationships weaken over time\n\n**Reinforcement**: Successful interactions strengthen trust. But what *really* strengthens trust? Something about their character?\n\n**Contagion**: Betrayal by one node affects connected nodes\n\n**Healing**: Networks can recover from betrayal through new connections\n\n### 5.5 The Diamond Route Problem\n\nWhen trust in humans fails, networks often retreat to machine-only trust (the \u2666 route):\n\n```\nHuman betrayal \u2192 Never trust humans \u2192 Only trust algorithms\n                                    \u2193\n                        Expert systems with rigid rules\n                        Voting mechanisms\n                        Institutional capture\n```\n\nThis degeneration creates brittle systems that fail at boundaries. The solution: build antifragile trust networks that strengthen through betrayal rather than retreating to mechanical rules. Let human beliefs about each other - human strife - be part of the system.\n\n### 5.6 Trust as Economic Lubricant\n\nHigh trust enables:\n- 90% reduction in transaction costs (no verification needed)\n- 95% reduction in legal overhead (no contracts required)\n- 99% reduction in settlement time (instant transfer)\n- 100% reduction in enforcement cost (reputation handles it)\n- 100,000,000% increase in actual competition in performance at any task\n- 100,000,000,000,000% increase in 'variants tried' or 'variatns ready to be deployed' and 'development novel branches'.\n\nThis massive efficiency gain makes trust networks outcompete traditional systems.\n\n### 5.8 The Economics of Trust Work\n\nThe transformation of human labor in NSS:\n\n**Traditional Economy Human Work**:\n```\nHR: Gate-keeping ($50k/year)\nMiddle Management: Control flow ($80k/year)  \nBureaucrats: Process permits ($60k/year)\nSales: Convince people ($70k/year)\nTotal Value: Mostly extraction (Pseudo-work Type 2: Only useful due to bad systems)\n```\n\n**NSS Economy Human Work**:\n```\nTrust Architect: Design network protocols ($200k/year)\nConnection Weaver: Bridge communities ($150k/year)\nPoP Witness: Verify humanity ($100k/year)\nReputation Translator: Enable movement ($180k/year)\nTotal Value: Pure enablement\n```\n\n**Why Trust Work Commands Premium**:\n- Cannot be automated (requires human presence) Trust of Trust massive economic-enabler. Proving and mapping human belief in Agathos or true-virtve character.\n- Enables trillions in automated value flow\n- Reduces transaction costs by >99.9%\n- Creates the substrate everything runs on. The playground or the arena: The Polymorphic Crucible.\n\n**The Multiplier Effect**:\nOne good trust bridge between networks can:\n- Enable millions of transactions\n- Reduce friction for thousands of people\n- Post Hoc 'disputes' a thing of the past: causes immediate divergence and less interaction; all the way to total disjointed in actuality. (It is worth noting here, that it is indeed possible to have low or high-variance or no-trust triad realities, where such post-hoc disputes are \"as it is now\" with long lawsuits and lawmaking and whatever other hassle there may be. But, with these tools, one can do \"civilization only with Trustworthy\" or High-trust civilizations or Daemonias of any scale and degree (high-trust being one aspect to daemon).)\n- Create new possibilities for collaboration\n- Generate value far exceeding traditional work\n\n**Soft-Gradient Expertise**:\nThe most valuable trust workers understand:\n- Cultural nuances between networks\n- Domain-specific value weightings\n- Historical context of relationships\n- Subtle signals of reliability\n- When to bridge and when to maintain separation\n- What Agathonian Trust (Trust of Trust and Trustworhiness) is and what Trust With Task (TWT) is. How to discern between them and how to help others' do accurate mapping through your Trust Network Info as strong inferential node. As well as the above. Like, friend and enemy distinctions and degrees of Agathonian Trust, when facing one's enemy. And so on. To be: Wise when it comes to Trust. \"To be Wise with Trust Becomes Very Valuable\".\n\nThis deep human knowledge becomes MORE valuable as systems automate, not less. It is a massive part to enabling human-constraints in computational landscape: PoP and Trust Maps/Networks. The paradox of NSS: the more machines do, the more valuable human connection becomes, insofar Human is Master and not Machine.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Zero-Sum Paradox: Competition Creating Cooperation {#zero-sum-paradox}\n\n### 6.1 The Dual Nature\n\nNSS creates a paradox: brutal zero-sum competition within domains produces positive-sum outcomes for civilization:\n\n**Within Domains**: Your gain is another's loss\n**Across Society**: Everyone benefits from optimization\n\nThis designed brutality ensures maximum efficiency while creating abundance.\n\"There is X quantity of substrate to try variants on. This is the zero-sum landscape. Beyond that Protocol 'reinvests' into growth of substrate with novel variants often occupying or being the growth: Progress Amplified.\"\n\n### 6.2 The Mathematics of Competition\n\nWithin any domain the total resources that are finite become a 'battleground' of utilizing it. While those that fail to adopt NSS competition of their resources, those that fail to find NSS protocol sharing partners (Implicit Agothian? Trust Network) will surely find themselves missing out on massive utility opportunity and efficiency optimizations:\n\n```\n\u2211(all_actors_share) = 1.0 = constant\n```\n\nYou can grow from 10% to 20% share, with total bijection in others' shrinking. This creates relentless pressure for improvement.\nFurther, it is important to note that Re-investment is baked into NSS Protocols. Because it functions across all substrate owners being utilized, it causes an ability to coordinate and try out the many variants in intelligent fashion able to grow into utility as needed with proper responsiveness and growth.\n\n### 6.3 The S-Curve Reality\n\nGrowth follows logistic curves, not eternal exponentials:\n\n```\nGrowth_Rate = k * P * (1 - P/K)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- k = maximum growth rate\n- P = current position\n- K = carrying capacity\n\nThis creates three phases:\n\n**Early Stage** (P << K): Near-exponential growth possible\n**Middle Stage** (P \u2248 K/2): Linear competition intensifies  \n**Late Stage** (P \u2192 K): Diminishing returns dominate\n\n### 6.4 Why Zero-Sum Creates Abundance\n\nThe brutal competition between providers generates Automatic replacement (new pathways found and over time exp decay (sub-section point: zero-sum overtaking (No employees anymore. No human walling off within some NSS agreement sphere (See [25. Discovery OS](../25%20discovery-os-expanded-into-broader-picture.md) document [26. Crucible Discovery Synthesis](../26.%20crucible-discovery-synthesis.md)))) of actors and their machinery in any service by every single aspect being in a state of discovery to fulfill will-economically. Which causes:\n\n**For Users**:\n- Optimal service quality\n- Minimal costs\n- Continuous innovation\n- Maximum reliability\n\n**For System**:\n- Waste elimination\n- Efficiency maximization\n- Resource optimization\n- Evolution acceleration\n- Compensation of all weaknesses and discovering of niche angle in which one can provide utility with the substrate in one's possession.\n\n**For Civilization**:\n- Infrastructure management costs \u2192 0\n- Infrastructure costs \u2192 side-effect of longer-term pathway finding and will-coalescence in amortizing costs\n- Innovation rate \u2192 massively enabled and amplfied and multiplied and pluralized\n\n**The Fast Food Paradox**:\nIn the food domain (Section 12.5), zero-sum competition between industrial efficiency and ethical craft creates:\n- McDonald's outcompeted if denying NSS protocols and if they accept it their administration and task-solving food/burger makers will flow dynamically and fluidly; which will cause things like will-economic of getting food that is healthy and ethical will improve. How much? As much as the human population will it. If one desires \"beyond will-coalescence\" and into active \"will-disentanglement\" and leverage full will-economic utility; Then of course this is part of the game.\n- Craft chefs gain industrial scale access; Access flows through Trust Will-economics Maps which for such large organizational - even civilizational - impact is practically not subjective maps, but rather Trust Network effects, with subjective/individual will-economic consequences if heavily in dispute. (It is important to understand that much of this is \"the best market dynamics\" made real or possible. However, it is embedded and founded on a substrate that makes it all tangible and accountable. That makes it robust and secure. Much better than 'certifications' and 'employment' in providing trustworthiness to the quality of a service. And much much much better at understanding full scope of 'costs' or 'gains' had by making a 'transaction'/interaction. (These systems places Human Sovereignty at the individual level right below a Natural Selection market on zero-sum space on the planet: The Crucible. Then it offers a wide variety of natural selection systems (NSS) Polymorphic Crucibles across other domains.))\n- Consumers get will-economic efficient (e.g. ethical and supporting local small actors or cullinary creatives of the culture or things like pollution and poisonous load of it) food at near-industrial prices\n- Entire food systems evolves toward ... (Multiplexed for whatever that human will may be of those places or coalescent points in actuality including spacetime) \n\nThe zero-sum battle transforms both competitors, creating outcomes neither could achieve alone.\n\n### 6.5 The Multi-Domain Strategy\n\nSmart actors recognize single-domain limitations and diversify, one might as well try out one's ability to offer some niche variant in many domains, or offer substrate one has for utilitization by others into it serving real will-manifesting utility (Here it is important to understand that will-manifestation may be quite the opposite of what utility usually becomes in the current market; It can be things like wilderness and many other such anti {occupancy by as many humans as possible}) Which perhaps could be noted by a human actor like (TODO: Replace the following with something at least as sophisticated as blob_class reference and ES encoding scheme for such things as 'strategy' and 'phase'):\n\n```yaml\nActor_Portfolio:\n  domain_1: \n    share: 15%\n    phase: late_stage\n    strategy: maintain\n    \n  domain_2:\n    share: 40% \n    phase: middle_stage\n    strategy: compete\n    \n  domain_3:\n    share: 0.1%\n    phase: early_stage\n    strategy: exponential_growth\n    \n  domain_4:\n    share: 0%\n    phase: pre_entry\n    strategy: prepare_mutations\n```\n\nThis portfolio approach enables continuous growth despite individual domain limits.\n\n### 6.6 The Holistic Optimization\n\nWhile actors fight zero-sum battles, the system parameters guide holistic optimization:\n\n**Physical Laws**: Thermodynamics, information theory provide hard boundaries, 'physical innovations, efficiencies and constraints'\n**Protocol Parameters**: Latency, reliability, security requirements, reinvestment, parasitic-load or profit-extraction (This is relevant if vision was 0 cost infrastructure or whatever else it may have been), vision & intent (typical \u2663 and \u2666 fashion See [Routing subfolder](../Routing/))\n**Will-economy expresses Values with walking weight (Within Trust Network deem access)**: Environmental, social, aesthetic preferences (All nice talk, but are you willing to pay the extra for externalities like so dealt with. Or are you willing to do days or weeks or months or years of work to facilitate the alternatives? Years? Well if double the number of persons? What if millionfold number of persons all doing some walk/manifestation in coordination and unison.)\n\nThese create the fitness landscape that competition optimizes toward, ensuring individual battles serve collective good.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Merit Protection: Solving the Innovation Theft Crisis {#merit-protection}\n\n### 7.1 The Two Theft Mechanisms\n\nCurrent capitalism enables massive inefficiency through two forms of merit theft, while the cover \u2666 structure of states provide a third avenue of theft both legal and illegal:\n\n**Employment-Based Theft** (See [27. Employment and Robust Reliable Task Solving](./27.%20employment.md)):\n```\nEngineer creates breakthrough \u2192 Employment contract claims ownership \u2192 \nCompany patents innovation \u2192 Engineer gets salary \u2192 Company gets billions\n```\nThe key point here is: To have necessities of life, you have to accept employment, if you do, your potential is captured by corporate & capital.\n\n**Comprehension-Free Theft** (See [Civilizational Collapse Dynamics](./collapse/civ_collapse_appendix.md)):\n```\nAcademic publishes algorithm \u2192 VCs copy without understanding \u2192\nImplementation degrades \u2192 Original innovator can't improve \u2192 \nInnovation freezes at theft moment\n```\nThe key point here is: Dynamics of capitalizing in current \"liberal capitalism\" favors anyone willing to shortcircuit the process and bring it to market (and able to: See [13. Market Value](./13%20markets_value_discovery.md) and [A Critique of The West](./a_critique_of_the_west.md)).\n\n**State Theft** (See [Crucible](./17%20crucible_sovereignty_system.md) as solution and [MIRA](../mira/) as edge extreme case of The Crucible as the solution):\n```\nState decides to confiscate your documents or wage internal war upon its domestic adversaries (surveillance or spying is common. Sabotage too.)\n```\nKey Point here is: \"Might is Right, but not for ye\". Crucible makes anyone sovereign with the constraints of resourcefulness facing the universe and human-interaction will-equilibrium etc. (Including the will-disentangling incentivization of facilitating 'starter kits' for others to become sovereign on their own; And high-leverage actors including 0 position, who may wish to offer [The Devil's Love](./Routing/devils-law-of-love.md), even the worst, even their polarity, even Gabrial and Michael and Yahweh; Or flip the naming, what do I care. I figure the only source of true mercy in Christian philosophy is through The Devil: God condemns to eternal suffering in Hell, well then only the Devil can serve as the mercy: The finite test for perpetual torture, the finite test for perpetual ... Mercy of The Devil?)\n\nBoth mechanisms destroy innovation incentives and create massive inefficiency.\n\n### 7.2 How NSS Prevents Merit Theft\n\nIn NSS, merit theft becomes impossible through:\n\n**Performance Reality**: Copying an algorithm isn't enough\u2014you must make it competitive in the raw battleground 'all things considered' of fulfilling will-utility. The shallow copier will perhaps lack the depth of the long-term developer. However, with NSS protocols, the path to market is unbiased and safe to launch (to some degree or version) every step of the way in progress.\n\n**Continuous Evolution**: Standing still with stolen innovation means being overtaken. (There isn't a position that can be captured against real innovation and (will-)performance)\n\n**Trust Consequences**: Protocol adoption functions within Trust Networks foundations with the subsequent consequences of merit-less capture or theft. You can compete in substrate only through protocol adoption by substrate-(o/p)wners. [Emergent Civilizations](./1%20exec_summary_vision.md)\n\n**Direct Value Flow**: Resources flow to actual performers, not idea claimants, mutatis mutandis protocol descriptions: Like, inventor of some new theory or aspect gets 'royalties' from variants that build upon it. Here, it is simply Trust Network consensus or divergence and not law -- as well as subjective/individual will-economic perspectives. (The 'taking credit' becomes 'beliefs and the consequences of it when the many are empowered with consequent nodes of Agothonian Trust': Patents replaced with Lumen, Trust and Will-economics)\n\n**Scale Access Without Ownership**: The fast food example (Section 12.5) shows this perfectly\u2014an ethical chef doesn't need to build McDonald's infrastructure to compete with McDonald's. They can access the same scale advantages through NSS protocols while maintaining their craft integrity. Merit (ethical food creation) can't be stolen because it must be continuously performed, not just claimed.\n\n### 7.3 The Innovation Acceleration\n\nWhen merit can't be stolen:\n\n```\nTraditional System:\nInnovation in small enclosure corporate bubbles and academia \u2192 Theft likely, guaranteed and often enforced by law \u2192 Resource limit to further development in the hands of those who could; at least having to go through layers/filters of 'others' \u2192 Innovation stifled\nRate: Undefined; Usually stagnant, then a few get to attach their innovation to some 'market mafied ship' able to make headway with it and experience some growth or utility. Though global markets and in this current setting has a very node-centralizing effect.\n\nNSS System:\nInnovation \u2192 Protected by performance \u2192 Full reward + ability to conquer substrate and zero-sum resources \u2192 Not having to wait for new funds, though new funds focused upon reinvestment (progress instead of profit mindset) \u2192 Uncompetitive Variants by protocol (and NSS foundation to select from) ensures anyone can acquire substrate for variant testing battlegrounds performance attempt to enter exponential zero-sum eating and protocol reinvestment growth-share \u2192 Trust Network ensures all the human-constraint hassles are mostly gone as well as foundational to the previous points of having a vast cross ownership substrate to compete within \u2192 Innovation limits mostly removed and hyperempowered to grow in true exponential fashion according to protocol-constrained will-performance.\nRate: Exponential\n```\n\nThis protection creates a Cambrian explosion of efficiency (not only in physical metrics but in that will-manifesting dynamic) and perhaps innovation.\n\n### 7.4 System Competition Not Mandate\n\nNSS doesn't mandate adoption. Instead, it enables competition:\n\n**Traditional System**: Merit theft enabled\n- Loses innovators to NSS\n- Innovation rate slows\n- Efficiency gaps grow\n- Natural selection against\n\n**NSS System**: Merit protected\n- Attracts innovators\n- Innovation explodes\n- Efficiency maximized\n- Natural selection for\n\nThe market of systems evolves toward merit protection.\nIt simply offers what would appear to be massive conglomerate fusions. But where it is all individual ownership and battleground (Utility Crucible) according to will-manifestation efficiency (aiddaemon-to-aiddaemon will-equilibrium); Both between (p/o)wner and utilizer/controller/commander; and between (p/o)wner and utility askers (will-manifestation pathfinding includes owner). This makes \"the many who can function within some trust or civilizational setting\" able to \"be as if a ideal-perfect-corporation\" but without any of the domination: In total liberation, but with will-coalescent and will-disentangling and Trust consequences in expressing one's total liberation. It can have will-economic perturbations, it can have sea, ocean or civilization distancing. It can even make A World of Difference.\n\n### 7.5 Real-World Transition\n\n**The Academic's Choice**:\n- Option A: Publish traditionally, get citations while companies profit billions (often indirectly by spinning from it; often behind the curtain then proclaiming they 'function in another way' (publish technology they don't use a lot of)); but more than anything: Any 'not playing by the rules actors' and that especially includes states around the world. Your Lumen is 100% when in Academia, i.e.: \"Anyone and Everyone should have the capacity I can earn through a lifetime of hard intellectual or engineering or other work.\" aka: \"Those that could acquire this, do not deserve to wield that power anymore than any one else\" or \"I can see no one on the planet who could wield my lifetime work better than any one and every one else at once\".\n- Option B: Implement in NSS, performance ensures resource flow to you; recommended to do it Trustless or High Trust, such that your performance isn't stolen. And further recommended to keep Lumen low. It is up to you. But if you don't like Multipolarity chaos and Vulnerable World without massive dystopian dictatorship and wars: Then consider that Lumen lowering suggestion. (There are many other points, like: The Pit. (See some chat-gpt dialogue))\n\n**The Engineer's Decision**:\n- Option A: Develop at company, they own it forever\n- Option B: Develop in NSS, you command the function, you can only \"own it\" within a law/rule/belief/trust-framework (civilization foundation aspect: Ownership. \u00acCiv: Pwnership is all there is). That is, if you run \"your code\" in Trust Mode on Low Trust substrate, then of course, others can copy and compete with your variants. That is why it works best with Trust Network high-trust foundations. But you can do it the other way, then have Lumen reductions \"dumb actuators projected\" and much more (Key function of Subaiddaemonic wrapping. You can do Lumen control with ad-hoc generating the \"dumb\" acute utility; Deliberately Dumb Genetic Programming by Aiddaemon)\n\n**The Company's Dilemma**:\n- Option A: Keep stealing innovation, watch talent flee\n- Option B: Adopt NSS protocols, compete on protocol terms (Which may be vacuous terms outsourcing it to will-economics) on substrate ownership \"parasitism\" (it can be), but open for best utilitizers for will-manifestation or the will-economy. (Will equilibrium of owner subaiddaemon and utility-demander (sub)aiddaemon)\n\nNatural selection determines outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Incentive Design: Learning from Gaming and Human Nature {#incentive-design}\n\n### 8.1 The Gaming Proof\n\nMillions of people optimize game performance while:\n- Paying money (negative financial ROI)\n- Sacrificing health (sleep deprivation, RSI)\n- Spending thousands of hours (Massive lost opportunity costs; While with ignorance that makes bliss becomes information one wishes could be oblivion when made visible by coming systems)\n- For virtual points with no real value\n\nThis proves: humans naturally optimize when metrics are clear and recognition is visible. Especially when in a social hierarchal (To serve and command), ranking (To rise and fall in relation to others) or cooperative (To benefit and plussum-together) setting.\n\n### 8.2 The NSS Incentive Stack\n\nIf people grind for game rank while paying, imagine when guaranteed:\n\n**Clear Metrics**: Performance measured in microseconds, efficiency percentages, healing rates. (Real world impact, consequences and subsequent gain or loss: Ludomani/gambling-addiction but contained in will-manifesting will-economic 'metric' world -- Guarantee it reaches for human-willing)\n\n**Social Recognition**: \"Routes 30% of Triad#8#3923#32 traffic\" visible to all (European replaced with Triad, because it is both future proof notation and it offers a more believable lived experience. That a person sees some human-constraint reasons to be able to grow their competitiveness locally with preference; Then perhaps later do 5% of Triad#8#3923 or perhaps if really 'special performer' (you do the maths of such share/stake percentages across some point in time) 3% of Triad#8 or if for some reason 'the best' 33% (They did NSS protocol limit at 33% for #1 will-performer and rest fluid in variantness of will-manifesting niche will-performances (Inequality and non-rankable will-performance without projective subspaces and upsetting of 'best performers' therein)) Triad#8)\n\n**Comfortable Life**: Personal needs met without worry (Diversity endurance preference for natural selection)\n\n**Meaningful Impact**: Actually improving civilization (Why? Because will-disentanglement and ultimately Triad as Daemonias causes will-manifestation having 'orientation' in spacetime of a civilization. (See [Metroversals in Kant Commentary Document](./15b_kant_insights_manifesto.md)))\n\n**Intellectual Challenge**: Continuous optimization problems (symbiotic evolving of entire stack of substrate and environment; Having to adapt and continue progress or refurbish older substrates for new will-niches or utility. ({Discovery OS}-equivalency-class TOO is part of what can (p/o)wned. So, while much may be automatic, it isn't monolithic or 'shared'. It adds to robustness that discovery process isn't \"one published software\" (Natural Selection (with a littel embedding) is the published memetics: Polymorphic Crucible)))\n\n### 8.3 Personal vs Node-Based Rewards\n\nParasitism often arise from wanting to profit with scale; often in constant per node/unit profiting; often by wanting to profit \"as much as possible per node\" (no matter the method of further extraction and the consequences or cost therefrom). With this subsection an alternative is offered for protocol designs: \"scale to limit\" or \"scale with logarithmic dampening\" or in intuitive language \"profit from human perspective and not scale perspective\".\n\n**Node-Based** (Traditional):\n```\nReward = Nodes_controlled * Extraction_per_node\nIncentive: Monopolize and extract maximum rent\nResult: Parasitic empire building\n```\n\n**Personal-Based** (NSS Protocol Suggestion (But also favoured with will-manifestion empowerment per person (Remember: Progress over Profit simply wins. (Profit MAY result in 'wise reinvestment', but mostly it results in hoarded non-use/command or else in dispersal into random luxury or comfort)))):\n```\nReward = max(Comfortable_life_for_one_person)\nIncentive: Optimize performance (Command and reputation. Predictive consequences and subsequent pathway beliefs at wide)\nResult: Focus on excellence, not empire\n```\n\nThis seemingly simple change eliminates parasitic behavior while maintaining innovation pressure.\n\n### 8.4 The Recognition Layer\n\nWhat humans actually crave (usually something about their human to human interrelations):\n- Respect for real contribution\n- Recognition of excellence\n- Meaningful impact on world\n- Peer acknowledgment\n- Legacy of innovation (In perpetuity able to projected into variant form again or be built upon by other variants (See an example of this for software development Architecture-First IDE))\n\nNSS provides all through transparent utilization metrics. How to become utilized? Prove will-economic as utilizer or substrate provider. No marketing needed\u2014 the subject/invididual is hyper-empowered to \"discover\" will-performance itself.\n\n### 8.5 Guaranteed Prosperity vs Lottery Tickets\n\n**Current System** (Lottery):\n```\nWork 100 hours/week \u2192 High chance of failure (Not your company will win. At best you get bought up. Otherwise employment and at best get a tiny tiny tiny sliver of vested shareholding. While being the core-value provider to the business.)\nSacrifice everything \u2192 Maybe die broke while having had all the merit and made manifest of it. But thwarted by bad systems and copy-cat-capitalizers.\nInnovate brilliantly \u2192 Capital almost certainly steals it (history of innovation since capitalism; prior to that it was too stolen if the patron of some scientists was into total-lumen)\nExpected Value \u2248 Extreme Uncertainty which makes most seek the ploy of employment and having all potential captured by corporate capital.\n```\n\n**NSS System** (Guaranteed):\n```\n\"Human Worth\" Dynamics \u2192 Makes anyone valuable for striving towards their will\nPerform well \u2192 Guaranteed comfortable life\nInnovate better \u2192 Definitely command more\nCreate value \u2192 Certainly get recognition\nExpected Value = High for all performers\n```\n```\nPerform well \u2192 Guaranteed comfortable life (This is protocol design as well as NSS foundation Diversity preference as well as general \"human value\" in trying to will-coalesce/manifest/disentangle as well as foundation utility easy to add to: PoP PoU and even Trust Networking. All in 'strata' fashion adding to livability of anyone. But especially if able to then add real polymorphic crucible prowess in some morphism of it. Like that of Triads or whatever else 'utility' provided (Again, often, it is entirely unclear how the many positive-sum effects are present when simply trying to greedily fulfill your own will within a will-coalescence system like these))\nInnovate better \u2192 Definitely command more (Unless, of course, you are without any will-coalescence possibility. If you're outside actuality of others. An example could be some serial killer nobody wants, but finds mercy of the devil to have their own triad. They probably will never be trusted or willed to compete for utility; perhaps no matter their merit)\nCreate value \u2192 Certainly get recognition\nExpected Value = High for all performers\n```\n\nThis transforms innovation from Russian roulette to reliable path. The enticement of doing employment contracts disappears. As well as 'welfare states'. As well as most modern varieties of 'states'. \"The responsibility we have towards each other\" that is so heavily overused to impose enslavement and force upon others. It all goes away, the memetics stay, but the justification for 'the bad means to have it happen' mostly if not entirely goes away. It will take very few high-leverage actors to deal with those outside actuality of others, totally inept without altruists or overlapping will-manifestation effects; and so on.\nIt is a tiny tiny miniature ARK-esque project. Where one deals with the edge cases outside acceptable or symbiotic human-interrelation.\n\n### 8.6 The Command Reward\n\nBeyond material comfort, NSS offers what money can't buy:\n\n\"I route 3% of global internet traffic efficiently\"\n\"Since implementing my protocols there 50,000 people have found treatment and successful being healed from their otherwise seemingly fatal disease\"  \n\"My energy production powers three cities and I've made some cool energy optimizations that is growing massively across 100 other cities\"\n\nThis command over real infrastructure, this truthful, visible and remembered impact on the world, motivates far more than hoarded wealth -- at least if hoarded but hated.\n\n---\n\n## 9. The Exponential Growth Engine {#exponential-growth}\n\n### 9.1 The Core Promise\n\nNSS exists fundamentally to make reality human-willed, which requires that we also enable (catastrophe speed?) exponential growth for better will-performers (A lot of details in this. But Diversity Preference and Projection Atlas (Intent, Reason, Actuator combination (Polymorphic Crucible Triadness of which Will-incarnate, Halo, Substratum is The Crucible Triad)) and Exponential Growth by Will-economics or Will-manifestation. All together which causes responsiveness to catastrophe in pluralistic and diverse fashion but where 'successful' wins fast. (Within human constraints. There isn't anything 'forcing': Assume everything I write maximizes will and freedom (The consequence is what in terms of catstrophe? Natural Selection in a very real sense. Unfortunately. The best I can do. You do yours. Maximal responsiveness to will. Bridging gaps towards Full Raw Power Displays.

Easily assessible.\n\n### 9.7 The Self-Funding Revolution\n\nThe transformative insight: NSS quickly becomes self-funding.\n\n**Phase 1: Capital Bootstrap**\n```\nInitial: Capital decides to become substrate for NSS competition\nCost: They install published Discovery OS systems on their substrate. Which opens up the system for NSS competition.\nParasitic load: NSS players see substrate node and the NSS protocol specifics which insists on a parasitical load: Y% or \"20% of efficiency gains are cut for owner\" as an example.\n```\n\n**Phase 2: NSS Generates Surplus**\n```\nAfter optimization: NSS protocol efficiency gains\nAmortized Cost reduction: kk% through natural selection\nSurplus generated: $XeN\nParasitic load: (Y+Protocol_Specifics_optimizer_parasiticism)% * XeN\nNSS Growth Funds: (1 - (Y+Protocol_Specifics_optimizer_parasiticism)) * XeN\n```\n\n**Phase 3: Surplus Funds Mutations**\n```\nSurplus allocation:\n- 60% to Substrate mutations growth/(Substrate purchase into NSS protocol specified ownership (Protocols that reduce parasiticms are trade off with having sufficient incentive. But because systems open up, low paracistism systems can't be \"held down\" and will thus dominate. (Life free from parasites reducing their surplus value by massive amounts or not)))\n- 20% to Substrate demand connective experiments\n- 20% to entirely new domains\n```\n\n### 9.8 Hardwire System Evolution\n\nFor physical infrastructure, the challenge is real:\n\n**Traditional Problem**: Can't easily swap phone lines \u2192 cable \u2192 fiber \u2192 wireless and suppliers redundantly establish substrate and compete a zero-sum game of utility provisioning to the same actors with the same mutations. (Innovation and growth stifling. Price increasing. Winner takes all gambling that possibly increase investment as compared to capital version with cooperation or sharing profits.)\n**NSS Solution**: Open access competition and mutation funding\n\n```\nGeneration 1: Compete within existing infrastructure\nGeneration 5: Surplus funds parallel infrastructure\nGeneration 10: New infrastructure outcompetes old\nGeneration 15: Old infrastructure abandoned/repurposed\n```\n\n**The Geometric Reality**:\n- Not constant real-time iteration\n- Discrete building phases\n- Each generation enables next\n- Exponential improvement between generations\n- **Growth based on performance toward intended purpose**\n\n**Performance Metrics by Purpose**:\n```yaml\nPhone_Lines:\n  intended_purpose: \"Voice quality communication\"\n  metrics: [clarity, reliability, latency]\n  geometric_growth: Based on voice optimization\n\nCable_Infrastructure:\n  intended_purpose: \"Broadcast distribution\"  \n  metrics: [bandwidth, channel capacity]\n  geometric_growth: Based on content delivery\n\nPower_Lines:\n  intended_purpose: \"Energy transfer\"\n  metrics: [efficiency, capacity, stability]\n  geometric_growth: Based on power optimization\n\nFiber_Optic:\n  intended_purpose: \"Data transmission\"\n  metrics: [speed, latency, error_rate]\n  geometric_growth: Based on information theory limits\n```\n\nEach infrastructure type grows geometrically in time steps based on how well it fulfills its original purpose, while also being free to discover new purposes through mutation.\n\n**Example: Phone Line Evolution**\n```\nYear 1: NSS optimizes for voice (2x clarity improvement)\nYear 3: Discovers DSL capability (new purpose emerges)\nYear 5: Splits evolution - some optimize voice, some data\nYear 7: Voice-optimized wins niche medical/legal markets\nYear 10: Data-optimized mostly replaced by fiber\n```\n\nThe system respects that each infrastructure was built to solve specific problems, and geometric growth happens when mutations better serve those original purposes OR discover entirely new valuable purposes.\n\n### 9.9 Protocol Constraints on Growth\n\nWhile growth can be exponential, protocols shape it:\n\n**Collaborative Substrate Rules**:\n- Maximum takeover rate per generation\n- Diversity requirements maintained\n- Emergency service priorities\n- Geographic distribution minimums\n\nThese constraints ensure exponential growth doesn't create fragility while still allowing rapid evolution.\n\n\n### 9.10 Natural Ventilation\n\nThe system prevents permanent dominance through diversity preference and rapid responsiveness and ultimately serving human-will (whatever it may be):\n\n**Domain Disruption**: New innovation can reset advantages\n**Paradigm Shifts**: Quantum computing, fusion energy create new games\n**Continuous Entry**: Fresh players always arriving empowered to take-over\n**Performance Decay**: Without innovation, new mutations/variants are still tested and tried in the discovery process with natural selection upon it. \n\n**Prophet Pattern Applications**:\n\n**Healthcare Prophet**:\n```python\ndef health_prophet():\n    # Learns your biological patterns\n    predict_health_issue(3_days_ahead)\n    preorder_medications()\n    prebook_appointments()\n    prepare_treatment_protocols()\n    \n    # When symptoms appear:\n    # Everything already arranged\n    # Treatment begins instantly\n    # \"How did they know?\" \u2192 They predicted\n```\n\n**Traffic Prophet**:\n```\nMorning Commute:\n- Predicts your departure time\n- Pre-clears optimal route\n- Pre-synchronizes traffic lights\n- Pre-allocates parking spot\n- You drive: Green lights all the way\n- Arrive: Perfect spot waiting\n```\n\n**Financial Prophet**:\n```\nMarket Prophet:\n- Predicts liquidity needs\n- Pre-positions capital\n- Pre-calculates risk models\n- Pre-approves transactions\n- Trade execution: Instant\n- Settlement: Already completed\n```\n\n**The Ultimate Expression**:\nWhen an entire city runs on prophet patterns:\n- Everything happens just before you need it\n- Waiting becomes extinct\n- Delays disappear\n- Life flows like choreographed dance\n- The city feels alive and responsive\n\nThis is the promise of NSS: not just optimization, but systems that anticipate and prepare, creating experiences that feel like the universe is conspiring to help you.\n\n---\n\n**The Key**: Because the usual constraints that limits one to constant logistical limitations are removed by opening up domains by Trust, and NSS exponential growth and rest of the architecture: no position is permanent.\nThe teenager with a quantum algorithm can disrupt the established player with classical dominance. The chef with ethical innovation can challenge industrial food giants. Natural selection ensures continuous renewal, by making access to any system a question of Trust establishment, then creating your utility-islands that then can grow exponentially.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Speculation and Evolution in Infrastructure {#speculation-evolution}\n\n### 10.1 The Speculative Pattern\n\nNSS discovers optimal solutions through parallel speculation:\n\n```c\n// Traditional approach\nif (check_valid_header() && check_protocol() && check_destination()) {\n    process_packet();\n}\n\n// Speculative variants evolving in parallel\nvariant_optimist() {\n    process_1000_packets_assuming_valid();\n    verify_batch_at_end();\n    if (failed) rollback();\n}\n\nvariant_paranoid() {\n    deep_check_everything();\n    process_carefully();\n}\n\nvariant_prophet() {\n    predict_next_packet_pattern();\n    precompute_response();\n    if (correct) instant_response();  // Zero latency!\n}\n```\n\nNatural selection determines which variant dominates under current conditions.\n\n**The Prophet Optimization**:\nThe prophet variant achieves something remarkable - zero or even negative latency:\n- Predicts what request will come based on patterns\n- Computes response before request arrives\n- When prediction correct: response ready instantly\n- Effective latency: NEGATIVE (response prepared before request)\n\n**Real-World Prophet Examples**:\n```\nWeb Server Prophet:\n- Learns user browsing patterns\n- Pre-renders likely next pages\n- User clicks link \u2192 Page appears instantly\n- Feels faster than physics should allow\n\nEnergy Grid Prophet:\n- Predicts factory startup at 6 AM\n- Pre-positions electrons at 5:55 AM\n- Factory switch flips \u2192 Power flowing instantly\n- No ramp-up delay\n\nTrading Prophet:\n- Predicts order patterns from market data\n- Pre-calculates likely trades\n- Order arrives \u2192 Already executed\n- Microseconds become nanoseconds\n```\n\n**Evolution Discovers Prophet Patterns**:\n- Generation 1: Simple request-response\n- Generation 10: Basic caching\n- Generation 50: Pattern detection\n- Generation 100: Predictive precomputation\n- Generation 500: Complex prophet networks\n\nThe system evolves from reactive to predictive to prophetic, ultimately appearing to violate causality through accurate prediction.\n\n### 10.2 From Virtual to Physical\n\nThe profound insight: speculative patterns in code become physical infrastructure:\n\n**Software Discovery**: Algorithm finds optimal electron routing\n**Physical Manifestation**: Actual power lines built on those routes\n**Infrastructure Evolution**: Physical network continues evolving\n\nThe virtual has become physical. Code patterns manifest as concrete and steel.\n\n### 10.3 Parallel Physical Speculation\n\nInfrastructure itself becomes speculative:\n\n**Three Power Routes Built**:\n1. Optimist Route: Direct, minimal insulation, assumes good weather\n2. Realist Route: Standard insulation, normal redundancy\n3. Paranoid Route: Underground, cooled, maximum redundancy\n\nAll three physically exist. System uses optimist when possible, switches instantly when assumptions break.\n\n**Funded by NSS Surplus**:\nTraditional capital would never build three routes. But NSS protocol's efficiency gains generate surplus that funds these parallel experiments. The \"waste\" of multiple routes is offset by:\n- 97% efficiency on good days (vs 70% single paranoid route)\n- Zero downtime when conditions change\n- Learning which assumptions actually matter\n- Data for next generation improvements\n\n### 10.4 The Coordinated Dance\n\nWhen multiple actors' algorithms coordinate:\n\n```\nWind_Farm_Algorithm: Predicts morning burst, spins up early\nBattery_Algorithm: Predicts price pattern, prepares storage\nFactory_Algorithm: Predicts cheap power, schedules production\n\nIf predictions align: Massive efficiency\nIf predictions fail: Rapid adaptation\n```\n\nThis coordination emerges without central planning through evolutionary pressure.\n\n**The Prophet Network Effect**:\nWhen multiple prophets coordinate:\n```\nRouter_Prophet: \"Packet surge from gaming district in 3.2 seconds\"\nServer_Prophet: \"Pre-allocating game server instances now\"\nCDN_Prophet: \"Pre-warming game assets to edge nodes\"\nPower_Prophet: \"Ramping up datacenter cooling preemptively\"\n\nResult: User launches game \u2192 Everything already ready\nPerceived latency: Negative 3 seconds\n```\n\nThe prophets create a cascade of precomputation, making the entire system feel prescient.\n\n### 10.5 Infrastructure Genetics\n\nPhysical infrastructure literally evolves:\n- Successful patterns propagate\n- Failed approaches die out\n- Mutations tested continuously\n- Natural selection operates on concrete and steel\n\n### 10.6 The Zero-Latency Revolution\n\nThe prophet pattern's ultimate expression: negative latency infrastructure.\n\n**Traditional Latency**:\n```\nRequest \u2192 Process \u2192 Response\nTime: 10-100ms minimum\n```\n\n**Prophet Latency**:\n```\nPredict \u2192 Precompute \u2192 Response \u2192 Request arrives \u2192 Instant delivery\nTime: -1000ms to 0ms (negative!)\n```\n**Encrypted Data Prophet Latency**:\n```\nPredict \u2192 Precompute \u2192 Encrypted Response \u2192 Request arrives \u2192 Instant delivery of data \u2192 Response with Decryption Key \u2192 No Throughput latency only ping latency\nTime: 0ms\n```\n\n**The Economic Origin of Prophecy**:\nThis prophet behavior emerges naturally from the daemon economy (Section 3.4):\n\n```python\nclass ComputeDaemon:\n    def evolve_strategy(self, task_history):\n        # Generation 1: React to tasks as they arrive\n        # Generation 10: Notice patterns in task types\n        # Generation 50: AiDDaemon Evolution to begin Predicting likely next tasks\n        # Generation 100: Precompute predicted tasks\n        # Generation 500: Break sequential dependencies and gain \"earnings of computing before the others task\". It's connective (\"spatial geometric\" (Obvious example is GPU data streaming. Or HDD or Network pre-caching)) niche also taken into consideration beyond its computational niche.\n        \n        if self.can_predict_next_task():\n            self.precompute_result()  # Earn before others even see task\n            self.break_dependencies()  # Parallelize \"sequential\" work\n```\n\n**Breaking Amdahl's Law**:\nTraditional parallel computing hits limits with sequential dependencies. But when daemons predict and precompute:\n\n```\nTraditional (Amdahl-limited):\nTask A \u2192 Task B \u2192 Task C \u2192 Task D\nMax speedup = 1 / sequential_fraction\n\nProphet Pattern (Amdahl-transcendent):\nPredict A,B,C,D \u2192 Compute all in parallel \u2192 Verify sequence later\nMax speedup = \u221e (only limited by prediction accuracy)\n```\n\n**The Natural Evolution**:\n1. Daemons compete for task queue earnings\n2. Faster completion = more earnings\n3. Prediction = earlier start = competitive advantage\n4. Precomputation = instant completion when task arrives\n5. Sequential breaking = parallel what seemed serial\n6. Amdahl's law becomes irrelevant\n\n**Real Example**:\n```\nVideo Rendering Pipeline (Traditional):\nDecode \u2192 Filter \u2192 Encode \u2192 Package\nEach step waits for previous: 100ms total\n\nVideo Rendering Pipeline (Prophet):\nPredict next frame characteristics\nPrecompute all stages in parallel\nWhen frame arrives: Already done!\nEffective time: -50ms (done before requested)\n```\n\n**How Negative Latency Works**:\n1. System learns patterns over time\n2. Predicts future requests with high accuracy\n3. Precomputes responses before requests exist\n4. When request arrives, response already waiting\n5. User experiences \"impossible\" speed\n\n**The Accuracy Evolution**:\n- Generation 1: 10% prediction accuracy (mostly wasted)\n- Generation 10: 50% accuracy (breaking even)\n- Generation 50: 90% accuracy (significant gains)\n- Generation 100: 99% accuracy (feels like magic)\n- Generation 500: 99.9% accuracy (indistinguishable from prescience)\n\n**Cascading Prophet Networks**:\nWhen infrastructure becomes prophetic:\n```\nMonday 5:55 AM:\n- Power grid prophets predict factory startup\n- Electron flow pre-positions\n- Cooling systems pre-activate\n- Network routes pre-optimize\n- Compute resources pre-allocate\n\nMonday 6:00 AM:\n- Factory systems activate\n- Everything already perfectly ready\n- Zero startup delays\n- Productivity maximized\n```\n\n**The Philosophical Implication**:\nNSS doesn't just optimize response time\u2014it effectively reverses causality through prediction, making the future pull the present rather than the present pushing toward the future.\n\n---\n\n## 11. The Crucible: Natural Selection for Governance {#crucible}\n\n### 11.1 The Governance Problem\n\nCurrent democratic systems force infinite human will into binary choices:\n- Representatives claim to represent \"majority will\" (impossible for diverse populations and which part of their \"will\": What degree or overlap/intersection; Surely not all their will; as that would be impossible unless quantum entangled beings.)\n- Club members rise through party systems (How? Unbiased process of their \"package philosophy\"? Interest Groups? Intelligence services? Lobby organization? \"Gray men\" in club promotion-deciding positions?) offering package deals\n- These packages poorly approximate anyone's actual preferences (Will and emotion diverse in mankind. But hey: If you don't like A then B is the answer. If you like b_172723, then B is the answer with 200,000 other decisions about what \"your will is\".)\n- No one's actual will configuration is represented (Not even the ones rising to the top of clubs have their will represented, as they become \"representatives of the 'package'\")\n- Change requires violence or voting for lesser evil (\"\u00acA!!!\" -> \"B\". \"A Won!!! And it is UNACCEPTABLE!\" -> \"Violent Revolution, since Voice or Will has no weight or space to express its dissent and be without A\")\n\n\"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.\" (Well, granted enough of those unwilling to accept what they find unacceptable...)\n\nThe fantasy that representatives embody \"will of the majority\" is absurd - they're party operatives executing pre-packaged agendas that at best vaguely gesture toward constituent preferences.\n\n### 11.2 The Crucible Solution\n\nReplace voting with voluntary association and natural selection:\n\n```\n10,000+ sovereignty experiments running simultaneously\nEach internally coherent\nCitizens vote with feet, not ballots\nNatural selection determines success (This is a Might (High Levarage Actors. \"He simply HAS THAT. And I want in, so I accept \"a deal\" or \"a cost\" in relation to something \"he want\") and Philosophical (\"Things that they say. And how I find it appealing or not\") and Rallying (What replaces voting \"I see what they made or heard what they want or have reason to believe what they are: And I want to be part of it. I want to amplify that. To vote for that by becoming part of it. Subordinating as subject or citizen in that system\") trade off)\n```\n\n**The Key Innovation**: No one is trapped. Unlike current systems where everyone (and also minorities whether 49%, 1%, or even a single person) must accept impositions by \"representatives of parliamentary or majority Will\", the Crucible ensures everyone can choose their tradeoffs. Don't like your current sovereignty? Leave and join another, or become sovereign yourself. The system removes entrapment (mechanisms that makes becoming trapped easier) and betrapment entirely.\n\n### 11.3 The 123404321 Structure\n\nBase layer suggested or hoped that high leverage actors can agree upon no matter their \"ocean\"; \"The Ubiquity Law\"; The law that all sovereignties must accept: Benevolence Codex (BC).\n\n**Protective Rights** (1234):\n1. Right to Exist (**No killing** (Do eternal Banishment and hardline Trust Networking to exclude them transitively.))\n2. Autorelease of harsh suffering. (To go free from harsh suffering)\n3. Free somewhere (Which entails no permanent imprisonment)\n4. Identity sovereignty respected (Especially the case of brain and bodily autonomy. Others \"changing you\" with e.g. drugs is hard limited by you and your \"I\")\n\n**The Routing System**: \nThe center (0) enforces these laws (High Leverage (Which may include Laurels or Horns or Sword or Shield or whatever else)). Banishment solves almost everything anywhere - When you have Trust Networks - because you can banish to a degree of \"as if they were dead\" or \"as you didn't exist to each other. Transitively\". If you really want to make banishment severe in punishment, then banish not to a neighboring sovereignty, but to (0) who can be viewed as The Exception to BC as they are the Raw Power that enforces it. Thus (0) becomes \"The Lord of Destruction\" (The only actor able to act beyond the BC. The High Leverage Actor exception.). Here banishment can potential go beyond BC by their assessment.\nThat is, they risk Laurel undermining of their Leverage. It becomes a sort of \"purgatory\" or \"hell\" that can function beyond the BC. Horns and Halos. The Halo (0) manage to make a \"right\" by their might, but then in turn their might becomes the key to violating the \"right\". Or in short: Their Horns makes the Halo real, but the Horns can go beyond Their Halo.\nI warn though, killing is a hard line of no return. When you make killing an absolute prohibition, then you prevent the exponential cycle of \"justified\" revenge killings that plague human societies; and you ensure that no one can accuse your rule of that level of ultimate injustice that killing allows for as potential, insofar they believe the person undeserving of death or innocent. It is an important line not to cross.\n\n**Aspirational Rights** (4321):\n4. Becoming (The i says \"I\" and 4 says \"Then try to Become\")\n3. Fulfillment (Will manifestation reaching crescendos)\n2. Meaning (Valleys and Peaks. That foundational meaning that makes valleys meaningful and peaks non-shallow. The Why.)\n1. Creation (Will of Existence To Be)\n\n### 11.4 Sovereignty Examples\n\n```yaml\nNeo_Venetian_Trade_Republic:\n  values: [commerce, contracts, efficiency]\n  population: 2.3M\n  growth_rate: 15%_annual\n  \nSpartan_Revival:\n  values: [honor, strength, discipline]\n  population: 450K\n  growth_rate: 8%_annual\n  \nEcological_Commune:\n  values: [sustainability, harmony, simplicity]\n  population: 890K\n  growth_rate: 12%_annual\n```\n\nEach offers different terms. Citizens choose by joining. Success measured by who thrives.\n\n### 11.5 Exit Rights Sacred\n\nThe one inviolable rule (3 corollary): anyone can leave anytime to at least one other place they can be free. (0 provision of those nobody wants. Like serial killers etc. \"Their Zones of Freedom. Where they suffer themselves or their own types. Bordering 'in' as no others accept them.\")\nThis transforms governance:\n- No trapped minorities\n- No permanent oppression\n- Bad systems lose citizens\n- Good systems attract them\n- Natural selection operates\n\n### 11.6 The End of Politics\n\nNo more:\n- Voting for faux-representative or lesser evil; But every act becomes \"your vote\". Holistic Voting of Choices.\n- Forcing compromise on all or domination without escape.\n- Pretending unity exists.\n- Revolution as only option.\n\nInstead:\n- Choose your sovereignty\n- Build your vision with hyper empowerment to find those others also willing your vision; While fundamentally of the same fabric or composition; daemon.\n- Rally others or join another\n- Natural evolution of governance. \n- The \"International\" becomes a million \"Fractally Sovereign Triad\"/Nest interrelation and deal-making. Nest runs as hard law vertical inheritance. Whereas lateral and very dynamic agreements run as \"intergovernmental law making\" in \"dynamics of the world meta-gaming\" (More on this for another time.).\n\n---\n\n## 12. Technical Implementations: From Theory to Practice {#technical-implementations}\n\n### 12.1 CohesionNet: The Mesh Communication Revolution\n\nCohesionNet demonstrates NSS principles applied to radio spectrum:\n\n**Traditional**: Government allocates spectrum, licenses restrict access\n**CohesionNet**: Trust networks negotiate spectrum dynamically\n\n```python\nclass SpectrumNegotiation:\n    def __init__(self, trust_network):\n        self.trust = trust_network\n        self.current_usage = {}\n        \n    def request_spectrum(self, frequency_range, power, duration):\n        nearby_nodes = self.discover_nearby()\n        trust_scores = [self.trust.get_score(node) for node in nearby_nodes]\n        \n        if self.emergency_request:\n            return self.emergency_protocol()  # Absolute priority\n            \n        negotiation = self.negotiate_with_nodes(\n            nearby_nodes, \n            frequency_range,\n            weighted_by=trust_scores\n        )\n        \n        return negotiation.result()\n```\n\nResult: 1000x more spectrum available, emergency services protected, innovation explodes.\n\n### 12.2 Computational Utility Networks\n\nEvery device becomes part of global compute fabric:\n\n```yaml\nYour_Device_Profile:\n  type: gaming_pc\n  idle_hours: [0200-0800, 0900-1700]\n  capabilities:\n    gpu: RTX_4090\n    cpu: AMD_5950X\n    ram: 64GB\n  \n  current_tasks:\n    - protein_folding: earning_rate: 12_tokens/hour\n    - ml_training: earning_rate: 8_tokens/hour\n    - render_farm: earning_rate: 15_tokens/hour\n```\n\nDevices discover optimal tasks through evolution, creating perfect global compute allocation.\n\n### 12.3 Health Pathway Discovery\n\nInstead of diagnostic boxes, continuous health state evolution:\n\n```python\nclass HealthState:\n    def __init__(self, symptoms, history, genetics):\n        self.state_vector = self.encode_health_state(symptoms, history, genetics)\n        self.trajectory = []\n        \n    def find_similar_journeys(self, global_health_network):\n        similar = global_health_network.find_nearest_neighbors(\n            self.state_vector,\n            distance_metric='health_similarity'\n        )\n        \n        successful_paths = filter(\n            lambda path: path.outcome == 'healed',\n            similar\n        )\n        \n        return successful_paths\n```\n\nPractitioners ranked by actual healing success, not credentials.\n\n### 12.4 Energy Routing Markets\n\nElectricity flows like internet packets:\n\n```\nDenmark_Wind \u2192 Germany_Industry: 5000MW @ 0.02\u20ac/kWh\nNorway_Hydro \u2192 UK_Residential: 3000MW @ 0.03\u20ac/kWh  \nSahara_Solar \u2192 Europe_Grid: 10000MW @ 0.01\u20ac/kWh\n```\n\nAll routed through trust networks, balanced by natural selection, without central planning.\n\n### 12.4 Energy Routing Markets\n\nElectricity flows like internet packets:\n\n```\nDenmark_Wind \u2192 Germany_Industry: 5000MW @ 0.02\u20ac/kWh\nNorway_Hydro \u2192 UK_Residential: 3000MW @ 0.03\u20ac/kWh  \nSahara_Solar \u2192 Europe_Grid: 10000MW @ 0.01\u20ac/kWh\n```\n\nAll routed through trust networks, balanced by natural selection, without central planning.\n\n### 12.5 Fast Food Revolution: When Ethics Meet Scale\n\nThe fast food industry demonstrates NSS transformation perfectly:\n\n**Traditional Fast Food Dominance**:\n```\nMcDonald's Advantages:\n- Massive supply chain contracts\n- Economies of scale on ingredients\n- Standardized processes\n- Global logistics network\n- $0.50 burger cost \u2192 $5 sale price\n\nEthical Chef's Disadvantages:\n- No scale leverage\n- Premium ingredient costs\n- Handcrafted processes\n- Local reach only\n- $8 burger cost \u2192 $15 sale price (still loses money)\n```\n\n**The Ethical Innovation Trap**:\nA chef who cares about:\n- Animal welfare (pasture-raised, humanely treated)\n- Environmental impact (local, seasonal, sustainable)\n- Worker conditions (fair wages, good environment)\n- Nutritional value (fresh, whole ingredients)\n- Taste excellence (crafted not manufactured)\n\nCannot compete because scale economics having grown to include quality/ethics by design. But instead let's all else find optimal realities that optimize the metric space: bottom line.\nAnd cannot compete because he does not have access to using their vendor-points or logistical networks; and more. Like staff.\n\n**NSS Transformation**:\n\nThe same chef in NSS:\n1. **Creates superior burger protocol** with full externality transparency\n2. **Publishes on food supplier network** with all metrics visible\n3. **Trust networks validate** ethical claims through PoU\n4. **Demand with \"deep will intent\"** flows to ethical option\n\nOn 3. Trust Network may be established by Trust actors of \"random or targeted checking of supply chains\" and if any part in the chain violates then they are penalized in Trust and thus disadvantaged in getting the demand (if at all) and in price equilibriums. It is crucial here that it is PoP \u2663 Trust Actor and not \u2666 system. Because, when it is system, then you get all the same \"convergences at the edges of the system\". Fitting to the rule system and optimization towards those limits of the system at the cost of all other things. Any metric space chosen, becomes fitted for at the cost of all things not in metric space. Therefore, having the fundamental trust in a \u2663 actor, who then uses \u2666 systems at every layer of his \u2663 fractal-pyramid organization: Provides the holistic eyes that is needed to Trust such checking is truly all-encompassing.\n\n```yaml\nBurger_Performance_Metrics:\n  traditional_metrics:\n    price: $5\n    speed: 3 minutes\n    consistency: 99%\n    \n  nss_holistic_metrics:\n    price: $6 (only $1 more at scale!)\n    speed: 5 minutes\n    consistency: 95%\n    animal_welfare: 98% (vs 10%)\n    environmental: 90% (vs 20%)\n    worker_conditions: 95% (vs 30%)\n    nutritional: 85% (vs 25%)\n    taste: 92% (vs 60%)\n```\n\n**The Exponential Growth Pattern**:\n```\nDay 1: Chef serves 50 ethical burgers locally\nDay 30: Protocol adopted by 5 restaurants (500 daily)\nDay 90: 50 restaurants across region (5,000 daily)\nDay 180: Major chain tests in 100 locations (50,000 daily)\nDay 365: Global adoption across 10,000 locations (5M daily)\n```\n\n**Why NSS Enables This**:\n\n1. **Infrastructure Access**: Chef doesn't need to build supply chains\u2014uses existing ones\n2. **Performance Visibility**: All externalities transparent through trust networks\n3. **Demand Alignment**: Consumers who value ethics can find and choose\n4. **Exponential Scaling**: Better performance \u2192 automatic growth\n5. **Parasitic Load Removal**: No franchise fees, corporate overhead, marketing waste\n\n**The Disruption Cascade**:\n- McDonald's sees customers flowing to ethical options\n- Forced to adopt ethical protocols or lose market share\n- Supply chains reconfigure around humane/sustainable sources\n- Industrial farming loses to regenerative agriculture\n- Entire food system transforms through natural selection\n\n**The Key Insight**:\nIn traditional capitalism, there isn't a system in place like Trust Networks and PoP that allows for ethical concerns to be monetarily penalized sufficiently; so, logistics efficiency beats ethical quality every time. In NSS, ethical quality that meets deep will intent can access the same logistics advantages, allowing true consumer preferences (including externalities) to drive selection. Your Aiddaemon system can help you match with deep intent with Trust actors trying with all tools at their disposal and real eyes on the chain of production, showing up and examinating, whether it is \"good\" or not. If it is not, then it receives Trust penalty that results in \"soft gradient exchange rates\" and \"price equilibrium changes\" or ultimately exclusion from demand chain that uses that Trust Actor.\n\nThe chef who makes one perfect, ethical burger can see it served in millions of locations within a year\u2014IF it truly satisfies deeper human desires than industrial alternatives.\n\n### 12.6 Infrastructure Consolidation and Competition\n\nNSS drives **access consolidation** while maintaining **competitive evolution**:\n\n**Not Merger But Open Access**:\nDifferent infrastructures become accessible across ownership boundaries while competing:\n- Phone lines evolve for voice optimization\n- Cable systems mutate for bandwidth\n- Power lines innovate for energy transfer\n- Fiber optic pushes latency limits\n\nEach infrastructure:\n- Remains distinct in purpose\n- Competes on performance metrics\n- Mutates toward its intended optimization\n- Grows geometrically based on what it solves best\n\n**Evolution Example**:\n```\nGeneration 1: Each infrastructure isolated\nPhone: 64kbps voice\nCable: 10Mbps data\nPower: 60Hz AC only\nFiber: 1Gbps data\nWireless: Autointerference and discoordination.\nSatelite: Redundant communication, remote and breaking \"tyranny of territory institutions information control\"\n\nGeneration 5: Cross-access enabled\nPhone: Discovers DSL data capability\nCable: Tests power-line communication\nPower: Experiments with DC data\nFiber: Carries quantum states\nWireless: Interference lowered, massive wireless potentials in devices discovered, but often islanded; meanwhile economic \"space filling\" with protocol harmonization such that it goes beyond economics for emergency uses. (Enabled by Trust Networking economic consequences of breaking trust)\nSatelite: Long distance wireless (lack of solid interference -- which allows for types of wireless communication beyond super low freq to scale well and relayed in satelites for long distances)\n\nGeneration 10: Geometric winners emerge\nPhone: Niche voice quality applications\nCable: Reliable low-latency communication and wireless-attack-resistant communication (low error rates)\nPower: Dominates home AC microgrids\nFiber: Wins medium-distance everything with potential losses (light interference problems)\nWireless: Bulk of localize data-flow running truly \"at the edge\" through opened \"any wireless devices\" (See [CohesionNet](./6%20cohesionnet_use_case.md))\nSatelite: Does bulk of long-distance to global data-flow communication.\n```\n\n### 12.7 The Hexagon Acquisition Model\n\nNSS protocols don't just build new infrastructure\u2014they acquire existing:\n\n**Acquisition Mechanics**:\n```\nExisting Infrastructure [C] \u2192 NSS Protocol evaluates \u2192\nIf parasitic load > threshold \u2192 Attempt Acquire as new hexagon [N]\nIf performance adequate \u2192 Implement NSS (Often simply by it running Discovery OS) [P]\nIf \u00acopen ^ \u00acacquirable ^ niche-advantage \u2192 Collaborative evolution [E]\n```\n\n**No Distinction Between**:\n- Building new infrastructure from scratch (Details of command chain for new substrate available different)\n- Buying existing and removing parasitism\n- Partnership agreements for access\n- Evolutionary collaboration\n\nAll are just \"new hexagons\" from the protocol's perspective, expanding the substrate for natural selection.\n\n### 12.8 The Protocol Choice: \u2618 vs \u2666\n\nThe critical distinction in protocol governance:\n\n**\u2618 Human-Dictation Protocol**:\n- Human judgement (using any tool (like AI), but a human above who can say yay or nay)\n- Adapts to unforeseen circumstances\n- Handles edge cases with wisdom\n- Maintains values through change\n- Can recognize when rules need breaking\n- Offers natural selection like in The Crucible variety upon PoP real persons and their ability to adapt and coordinate and choose parameters or rules or rulings with wisdom in all things.\n\n**\u2666 AI/Expert System Protocol**:\n- Systematic evaluations or Algorithmic optimization\n- Consistent rule application\n- No exceptions or mercy. (Does not have complexity of a humanity and a heart. Nor complexity that the system may get entirely wrong. Black Swans obvious to a human but for some reason was a system brittle point.)\n- Cliff failures at boundaries\n- Can't adapt beyond programming\n\n**The Key Point**:\nIt's not that \u2618 lacks tools\u2014humans use AI, analytics, expert systems. The question is whether final decisions come from:\n- A Human Wisdom (with tools) = \u2618\n- Mechanical rules (however sophisticated) = \u2666\n\nIt is worth pointing out, in similar fashion to similar considerations of The Crucible, that whether \u2663 or \u2666, can depend on both scale and domain. In this case, having the domain or some random utility, may make some preference a \u2666 or \u2663. At the very least, \u2663 should be a common choice for Triads/Daemonias.\n\nNSS protocols (enabled through trust/PoP/PoU collaboration) must choose their governance model. Natural selection will reveal which performs better in different domains.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Phase Transitions and Adoption Dynamics {#phase-transitions}\n\n### 13.1 The Lit Match Scenario\n\nOne major player adopting NSS triggers cascade:\n\n**Day 1**: Google opens 10% of data centers to natural selection\n**Day 30**: Utilization jumps from 30% to 100%, costs drop 80%\n**Day 90**: Microsoft and Amazon scramble to compete. Vast majority of surplus revenue is used to increase substrate and tyr out mutations.\n**Day 180**: Half of global compute on NSS protocols\n**Day 365**: Traditional data centers stranded assets\n\n**Critical Transition**: By Day 180, NSS protocols generate enough surplus from efficiency gains to self-fund infrastructure mutations. Capital's role shifts from essential substrate to optional participant.\n\n### 13.2 The Satellite Photo Prophecy\n\nBy 2030, infrastructure utilization visible from space:\n\n**Bright Zones** (NSS Protocol):\n- 95% utilization rates\n- Continuous innovation\n- Harmonious growth and exponential development against disharmony of protocol. (Be it specified by \u2618 vs \u2666)\n- Value creation visible\n\n**Dark Zones** (Traditional Control):\n- 15% utilization (Mexican Standoff capital lock-out of most utility)\n- Stagnant operations\n- Declining relevance\n- Value destruction\n\nLike North/South Korea demonstrating capitalism vs communism, these images will demonstrate evolution vs control.\n\n### 13.3 Critical Mass Dynamics\n\n**Phase 1** (0-5% adoption): Early adopters experiment\n- Small efficiency gains prove concept\n- Trust networks form (Initially by real world friendships and others by business and others by larger societal asssociations and others by national networks and others by religious/civilizational/cultural and others by emotion spectrum (sense of beauty or ugliness) and others by ethic assessments (trustworthiness and virtue of fundamental character (e.g. \"Do I trust that these persons will be true to their word of 'not looking at my data' that I ask them to compute upon\" or \"Do I believe they will hold their end to an oral bargain and deal with me in charity and grace; instead of trying to milk me dry or deceive me\") Part to Agathos..) and others by stated goals or assessed will alignment (all coexisting as maps that single persons have generated (often in collaboration (This is why it becomes Networks. And not simply Trust Maps. You let Trust be inferred transitively...) or with AI automation)))\n- Protocols develop\n\n**Phase 2** (5-15% adoption): Network effects emerge\n- Exponential improvement begins\n- Cross-domain learning accelerates\n- Traditional systems panic\n\n**Phase 3** (15-50% adoption): Cascade unstoppable\n- Old systems can't compete\n- Resource flows reverse\n- Evolution rate explodes\n- Territorial zones close borders to the system for fear of losing control. Often due to high leverage or influential actors within their borders. The populations fail to realize any concern of theirs can be solved by Trust Networks. But highly enriched persons of influence manage to convince them that their loss of control is the populations loss of control. When in fact, it merely makes it clear for the population whose in control and why and redistributes in a natural selective sense constrained by Trust Networked protocols allowed to run and actos allowed to compete on their substrate.\n\n**Phase 4** (50%+ adoption): New equilibrium\n- NSS becomes default\n- Traditional systems curiosities\n- Continuous evolution normal\n- Closed off and bordered against NSS and contextual system zones begin to look like the archaic and obscenely stupid. They adopt key points of the systems to compensate. While being able to keep control with their influential actors they implicitly protect against competition with proper feedback dynamics.\n\n### 13.4 Industry-Specific Transitions\n\n**Cloud Computing**: \n- Current: 20% utilization, vendor lock-in\n- Transition: Major player opens infrastructure\n- Result: 100% utilization (There exists an equilibrium that is possible to reach, if everything is made dynamic, mutating and open), costs drop 10x\n\n**Healthcare**:\n- Current: Credential-based, diagnostic boxes\n- Transition: Elaborate and deep Trust in competency including outcome tracking goes public\n- Result: Best healers win regardless of degrees. Degrees is \"one aposteori\" of trust in their competency to fulfill will and competitiveness of doing so all things considered.\n\n**Energy**:\n- Current: Monopoly utilities, fossil preference\n- Transition: Peer-to-peer energy trading\n- Result: 100% renewable integration\n\n### 13.5 Resistance and Adaptation\n\n**Traditional Power Responses**:\n1. Denial: \"This is just hype\"\n2. Anger: \"Unfair competition!\" (Aka. \"I don't get to make victories a blocking of competition without tangible and long-lasting market consequences\" (Trust Networks can bookkeep and easily manage such things. The NSS system is a system to ensure they can't (So non-adoption of NSS can easily mean being \"crony capital\"))) \n3. Bargaining: \"We'll adopt 10%\"\n4. Depression: \"We've lost everything\"\n5. Acceptance: \"Full protocol adoption\"\n\n---\n\n## 14. The Human Gradient: Where AI Meets Irreducible Humanity {#human-gradient}\n\n### 14.1 The 0 to 1 Scale\n\nNSS discovers to which degree different domains or \"all things considered\" context gradients from full automation to irreducible humanity; and which degree dominates when:\n\n**0 - Full Automation** (AI Dominates):\n- Packet routing optimization\n- Energy flow calculations\n- Trading algorithms\n- Pattern recognition\n\n**0.5 - Human-AI Collaboration**:\n- Medical diagnosis assistance\n- Creative design partnership\n- Strategic planning\n- Educational adaptation\n\n**1 - Irreducibly Human**:\n- The will to want authentic humanity and believably conscious interaction (Cogito Ergo Sum Extension Beliefs (CESEB) \"The material of the world and your gradience from animate to inanimate and belief of their consciousness and thus worth or loss had in disintegration or non-continuous existence (teleportation by disintegration and reassembling))\n- Trust through physical presence\n- Meaning creation\n\n### 14.2 Domain-Specific Gradients\n\nDifferent domains have different human necessity:\n\n```yaml\nInfrastructure_Routing: 0.1  # Mostly automated\nSurgical_Procedures: 0.4     # AI assists human skill, Automation occupies lower end or \"turing-performance bar to pass\"\nPsychotherapy: 0.7          # Human connection crucial, but Aiddaemonic sharing enables deep understanding of each other and commentary and discovery of miscommunication\nPhilosophy: 0.9             # Essentially human domain of valuation of philosophical merit. Crucible tests them in practice.\nLove: 1.0                   # Irreducibly human, but deep compatibility discovered by Aiddaemon + AR + Trust + PoP systems.\n```\n\n### 14.3 The Vesting Problem\n\nHow do we reward across the gradient?\n\n**Pure AI** (0.0): Rewards flow to protocol agreements when using it\n**Collaboration** (0.5): Shared between human and AI contributors  \n**Pure Human** (1.0): Rewards to human practitioners\n\nNatural selection determines optimal sharing formulas.\n\n### 14.4 The Consciousness Question\n\nNSS remains agnostic on AI consciousness but practical about capability:\n- If AI routes packets better, it commands packet routing\n- If humans heal better, they command healing\n- Performance determines domain control\n- Consciousness debates irrelevant to function\n\n### 14.5 The Ultimate Human Contribution\n\nHumans remain irreducible in:\n\n**Will Formation**: Deciding what to want\n**Trust Creation**: Physical presence creating bonds (Data that \"matters\"... Like really.. :P (Material reality and the animate material CESEB))\n**Meaning Making**: Determining what matters\n**Exit Choice**: The sacred right to leave\n\nThese ensure human agency regardless of AI advancement.\n\n### 14.6 The Trust Work Gradient\n\nTrust-related work sits firmly in the human domain:\n\n```yaml\nTrust_Work_Humanness:\n  PoP_Witnessing: 1.0        # Requires physical presence\n  PoU_Confirmation: 0.9      # Requires value judgment at some level of \"aggregation of utility\" (Think per electron utility delivery??? :P Often the line of aggregation is \"Task or intent realized\" (Task and intent bridged by Aiddaemonic emulation of you to allow for computer speed and availability intent matching))\n  Trust_Translation: 0.7     # Requires contextual wisdom\n  Reputation_Design: 0.6     # Human-AI collaboration\n  Network_Bridging: 0.5      # \"Half qualitatively\" of the work by Aiddaemon+Trust enabled-disclosure and will-field-physics; while the other half in a qualitative sense by human \"living and confirming or setting of network\". Most inferred by Trust Network effects.\n```\n\nAs functional work automates, trust work becomes MORE valuable:\n- Machines need trust networks to coordinate\n- Algorithms require human-verified data\n- Systems need reputation to function\n- Networks need bridges to connect\n- Trust changes in a settled state can cause massive economic upside or downsides. \"Sanctions that Work\".\n\nThe paradox: The better AI gets at functional work, the more critical human trust work becomes. We become the connective tissue that enables machine efficiency; by removing the social or human unnecessary blocking of optimal systems.\n\n---\n\n## 15. Language Evolution and Emergent Vocabulary {#language-evolution}\n\n### 15.1 The Naming Problem\n\nReality contains patterns that language hasn't named:\n\n- The exhaustion from switching between online personas\n- Information that flows better through gossip than official channels\n- Group momentum that continues despite losing original purpose\n- Cellular-level energy depletion in chronic fatigue\n\n### 15.2 Neologism Generation\n\nWhen blob classes discover stable patterns with high predictive value but no name (Whether neomorphic or not (neomorphism when words are overloaded in a non-poetic sense)):\n\n**Catajective** (adjective, \u00acneomorphic): To be in a state of desiring to tear down something.\n- Variants: chronocatajective (personality disorder), pseudocatajective, xenocatajective, autocatajective, patercatajective\n\n**Zelquine** (noun, neomorphic): The specific exhaustion from persona switching\n- Variants: hyperzelquine, pseudozelquine, chronozelquine\n\n**Flerent** (adj, neomorphic): Information flowing better informally than formally\n- Usage: \"That's flerent data\u2014don't put it in the official report\"\n\n**Quorvic** (noun, neomorphic): Group momentum beyond original purpose\n- Variants: antiquorvic (momentum reversal), hyperquorvic (acceleration)\n\n### 15.3 Natural Selection of Language\n\nWords compete like infrastructure:\n- Useful terms propagate through trust networks\n- Useless terms die from non-use\n- Meaning evolves through usage\n- Language becomes living system\n\n### 15.4 Technical Vocabulary Evolution\n\nNSS generates technical terms:\n\n**Blob Classes**: Neural patterns replacing categories\n**Diamond Routes**: Machine-only trust paths\n**Actualization Layer**: Where selection operates\n**Function Portfolio**: Personal economic participation\n\n### 15.5 Cross-Domain Language\n\nTerms migrate between domains:\n\n**From Gaming**: \"Grinding\" \u2192 Working on optimization\n**From Evolution**: \"Fitness\" \u2192 Performance measurement\n**From Physics**: \"Phase transition\" \u2192 System transformation\n**To Everything**: Natural selection metaphors\n\nLanguage itself evolves to match reality better.\n\n---\n\n## 16. Economic Implications: Infrastructure Approaching Free {#economic-implications}\n\n### 16.1 The Cost Collapse\n\nWhen NSS eliminates:\n- Profit extraction (20-30% of costs)\n- Inefficiency waste (50-70% of resources)\n- Artificial scarcity (price premiums)\n- Redundant competition (duplicate infrastructure)\n\nInfrastructure costs approach marginal cost of operation.\n\n**The Acceleration Effect**:\nOnce NSS becomes self-funding through efficiency gains, the cost collapse accelerates:\n1. Initial efficiency \u2192 Surplus generated\n2. Surplus funds mutations \u2192 Better efficiency discovered\n3. Better efficiency \u2192 More surplus\n4. Virtuous cycle \u2192 Costs approach zero\n\nThis self-reinforcing dynamic means infrastructure doesn't just become cheap\u2014it becomes essentially free for basic needs.\n\n### 16.2 Specific Domain Projections\n\n**Computation**:\n- Current: $0.10/hour for cloud instance\n- NSS: $0.001/hour for equivalent compute\n- 100x reduction through utilization\n\n**Energy**:\n- Current: $0.15/kWh residential\n- NSS: $0.01/kWh or less\n- \"Too cheap to meter\" becomes real\n\n**Communication**:\n- Current: $50/month for mobile\n- NSS: $0.50/month for better service\n- Bandwidth becomes like air\n\n**Transportation**:\n- Current: $2/mile for delivery\n- NSS: $0.02/mile through optimization\n- Distance becomes irrelevant\n\n### 16.3 The Freed Human Potential\n\nWhen infrastructure costs 5% instead of 60% of income:\n\n**Individual Level**:\n- Work becomes aligned with almost any type of will\n- Risk-taking possible without ruin (debitor Debt is impossible in sensible nests and protocols. Creditor debt is possible: Money. (You can own tokens of indebtedness (Money) but you can't be indebted to indebtedness (negative money or money recursion on itself. See Money Discussion. Suffice to say, indebtedness at one level without recursion is all there is needed and makes it \"earned\" and \"real\". (\"Here is a token of indebtedness to you counted in tokens of indebtedness of \"a nation\" or \"union\"(currency/money) Well what is this new credit note worth then? Well, the debit reliability, or the borrower financial capacity))))\n- Creative pursuits enabled\n- Time abundance created\n\n**Social Level**:\n- Communities self-organize\n- Experiments proliferate\n- Cultural renaissance\n- Connection prioritized\n\n**Civilizational Level**:\n- Post-scarcity for basics\n- Innovation explosion\n- Meaning becomes currency\n- Evolution accelerates\n\n**The Craft Renaissance**:\nWhen basic needs cost almost nothing and is naviagable in a deep intention sense, and higher order environment manifestation by will coalesence; Then human energy shifts to craft and meaning:\n- Chefs pursue flavor and ethics, not just efficiency\n- Artisans create beauty, not just function\n- Teachers focus on inspiration, not standardization\n- Healers address root causes, not just symptoms\n\nThe fast food example (Section 12.5) demonstrates this perfectly: when an ethical chef can compete with McDonald's on scale while maintaining craft values, we get the best of both worlds\u2014efficiency AND excellence.\n\n### 16.4 New Economic Categories\n\n**Abundance Goods** (NSS optimized):\n- Infrastructure services\n- Information access\n- Basic necessities\n- Computational power\n\n**Scarcity Goods** (Still valuable):\n- Human attention\n- Creative works\n- Physical presence\n- Unique experiences\n\n### 16.5 The GDP Paradox\n\nTraditional GDP might shrink while welfare explodes:\n- Less money spent on basics\n- More value created and consumed\n- Economic activity shifts to meaning\n- Measurement systems must evolve\n\n### 16.6 The New High-Value Work\n\nAs infrastructure costs approach zero, human work transforms:\n\n**Disappearing Jobs**:\n- Gatekeeping positions (HR screening)\n- Rent extraction roles (middlemen)\n- Bureaucratic functions (permit issuers)\n- Artificial scarcity maintainers\n- Infrastructure parasitism\n- Market corruption like Advertisement\n- Market access mafias like Adsense (Zero-sum pay-to-win-mafia competition to manipulate or be visible in market)\n\n**Emerging High-Value Work**:\n- Trust network architecture\n- Human connection facilitation\n- PoP witnessing and PoU confirmation (LLL gaming. Finding AR games you find fun to play travelling in the real world)\n- Cross-network reputation translation\n- Will coalescence acts\n- Healing trust after betrayals\n- Aiddaemonic sufficient disclosure for will-field-physics\n\n**The Shift**: From blocking value to enabling it, from extracting rent to building bridges, from maintaining scarcity to creating abundance through connection.\n\nThis work can't be automated because it requires:\n- Physical presence (PoP)\n- Value judgment (PoU)\n- Cultural understanding (translation)\n- Emotional intelligence (healing)\n- Trust through time (relationships)\n\nAs machines handle production, humans handle connection - and connection becomes the scarcest, most valuable resource.\n\n---\n\n## 17. Philosophical Underpinnings: Will Manifestation {#philosophical}\n\n### 17.1 Schopenhauer's Vision Transformed\n\nArthur Schopenhauer identified Will as the fundamental force underlying existence. Where he saw only suffering, NSS sees potential:\n\n**Schopenhauer**: Will as blind striving causing suffering\n**NSS**: Will as creative force seeking expression through performance\n\n### 17.2 The Three Realms\n\n**Physical Reality**: Will manifesting through matter\n- Bodies meeting in space\n- Resources exchanged\n- Infrastructure built\n\n**Augmented Reality**: Will manifesting through overlay\n- Probability paths visible\n- Multiple truths coexisting\n- Choice expanded\n\n**Virtual Reality**: Will manifesting without constraint\n- Pure ideation space\n- Impossible made possible\n- Training ground for physical\n\n### 17.3 Byron's Unity Recognized\n\n\"Am I not of the mountains and the sea?\" - Byron\n\nThis recognition of unity becomes infrastructure reality:\n- We ARE the computational substrate\n- We ARE the trust network\n- We ARE the collective intelligence\n- We ARE will seeking manifestation\n\n### 17.4 The Nietzschean Transformation\n\n**Will to Power** becomes **Will to Function**:\n- Dominance over others made good by sheer plurality, deep trade-off analysis and ability to forge own freedom including domination.\n- But excellence in domain\n- Not zero-sum power\n- But positive-sum capability\n\n### 17.5 Higher-Order Consent\n\nThe ship captain principle transforms governance:\n- Choose which ship to board (sovereignty selection)\n- Accept captain's authority for voyage\n- Retain absolute exit rights\n- Transform politics from compromise to coherence\n\nUnlike democracy's fiction of representatives embodying constituent will, this creates genuine consent through voluntary association. You don't vote for someone to misrepresent you - you choose a sovereignty that actually aligns with your values and can leave if it diverges.\n\n---\n\n## 18. Future Projections: The Satellite Photo Prophecy {#future-projections}\n\n### 18.1 The 2030 Visualization\n\nSatellite imagery will show:\n\n**NSS Protocol Zones**:\n- Blazing with 95% utilization\n- Innovation visible as rapid change\n- Network connections dense\n- Growth patterns obvious\n\n**Traditional Control Zones**:\n- Dark with 15% utilization\n- Static infrastructure visible\n- Isolated islands\n- Decay patterns clear\n\n### 18.2 The Cascade Timeline\n\n**2025-2026**: First major adoptions\n- Tech companies lead\n- 10x efficiency proven\n- Trust networks forming\n\n**2027-2028**: Industry transformation  \n- Energy sector converts\n- Healthcare evolution begins\n- Transportation revolutionizes\n\n**2029-2030**: Civilizational shift\n- Majority on NSS protocols\n- Traditional systems failing\n- New equilibrium emerging\n\n**2031+**: Full evolution\n- Continuous adaptation normal\n- Innovation rate beyond prediction\n- Human potential unleashed\n\n### 18.3 Technological Enablers\n\n**Required Technologies**:\n- Ubiquitous computing devices\n- High-bandwidth networks\n- Cryptographic identity systems\n- AR/VR interfaces\n\n**Emerging Amplifiers**:\n- Quantum computing\n- Brain-computer interfaces\n- Fusion energy\n- Space resources\n\n### 18.4 Social Evolution\n\n**New Norms**:\n- Performance over credentials\n- Function over employment\n- Exit over voice\n- Evolution over revolution\n\n**Cultural Shifts**:\n- From ownership to stewardship\n- From competition to coevolution\n- From scarcity to abundance mindset\n- From control to performance\n\n### 18.5 The Unknowable Emergent\n\nNSS enables futures we can't predict:\n- New forms of organization\n- Unprecedented innovation rates\n- Civilizational experiments\n- Consciousness evolution\n\nThe only certainty: continuous change selected by performance.\n\n---\n\n## 19. Beyond Capital Command: Personal Rewards, Thrownness, and Constructive Terraforming {#beyond-capital}\n\n### 19.1 The Personal-Cap Innovation\n\nA critical design choice in NSS protocols: whether rewards scale with nodes controlled or cap at personal prosperity.\n\n**Node-Scaling Rewards** (Traditional):\n```\nReward = Nodes_controlled * Value_per_node\nResult: Incentive to monopolize, empire-build, extract rent\nParasitic Load: High (every node pays tribute)\n```\n\n**Personal-Cap Rewards** (NSS Option):\n```\nReward = min(Performance_value, Protocol_Personal_luxury_life_cap)\nResult: Focus on excellence, not expansion\nParasitic Load: Minimal (no scaling extraction)\n```\n\nThis seemingly simple change has profound effects:\n- Eliminates empire-building incentive\n- Focuses effort on optimization not acquisition\n- Reduces system-wide parasitic costs\n- Enables pure performance competition\n- No monetary incentive in growth in network beyond having reached Protocol_Personal_Luxury_life_cap, which removes the greed incentives from ever-growth, and trying to totally dominate the scene, but allowing others success-space as well, despite being able to outcompete them.\n\n### 19.2 The Number Game Redirected\n\nHumans are wired to want ever-increasing numbers. Rather than suppress this drive, NSS redirects it:\n\n**Instead of Universal Money**:\n```\nBank Account: $1,000,000,000 (commands almost everything (Not nuclear or other WMD command, but private military? (One step short of combination that makes it \"illegal\" (Always retreat another step of combination back upon attacks by state or lawfare)) (spartan expenses in idle state?)))\n```\n\n**Domain-Specific Merit Scores**:\n```\nRouting Excellence: 94,847,293 packets optimized\nHealing Impact: 8,472 lives improved\nEnergy Saved: 1,847,293 megawatts\nTrust Rating 'Essential Projective 1d Metric' in crucial Trust Networks: 9,847 reliability score\n```\n\nThe numbers keep growing, but they represent actual merit in specific domains. Crucially:\n- Your number growing = System improving\n- Competition for score = Cooperation for outcome\n- Merit accumulation \u2260 Universal command\n\nTrust Networks and PoP enable holistic weighting of these scores, considering environmental impact, social benefit, and long-term sustainability.\n\n### 19.3 Protocol Flexibility in Incentives\n\nNSS doesn't mandate specific incentive structures. Different protocols can experiment:\n\n**Fixed Rewards**: Mutation provides set benefit regardless of adoption (Play to win. Win for own joy.)\n**Logarithmic Scaling**: Diminishing returns with scale (This one makes parasitism load maximal by having as many competitive actors surviving or thriving)\n**Mining-Style**: Proportional to network contribution (This one sets a limit to parasitism)\n**Personal Excellence**: Capped at human-scale prosperity (This one destroys parasitism)\n**Temporal Parasitism**: Profit from efficiency gains can be high, but then temporally limited. Say, 100% of efficiency gains for a maximum of a year.\n\nNatural selection determines which incentive structures produce:\n- Maximum innovation\n- Minimum parasitism\n- Optimal system evolution. The many protocols and the \"gatekeeping\" of which protocols get to play. Then dynamics of \"civilizational accelerating differences dependent on growth enabled by protocol\" (Which is highly subjective: Perhaps the good innovators are more attracted to -- beauty wise -- one or the other stated protocol incentivizations or general schemes) But also, subject to things like \"bottom-line reinvestment capacity\". (The Korean divide map...)\n\nWhat matters: parasitic load stays low while transformative pathways remain open through NSS dynamics and Crucible options.\n\n### 19.4 Modern Thrownness and Market Prisons\n\nHeidegger's concept of thrownness (Geworfenheit) - being thrown into a world not of our making - manifests today in locked market positions where \"choice\" is illusory.\n\n**The Housing Trap**:\nEveryone faces the same \"choice\":\n- Compete to indebt yourself for 30 years\n- Or have no stable shelter sufficient for a decent family life\n\nIndividual discipline (\"work harder,\" \"be smarter\") can't escape when everyone else accepts the trap. A race to the bottom where signal (desperate need) gets dispersed into:\n- Hoarded wealth not creating supply\n- Luxury consumption by sellers\n- Speculation worsening scarcity\n\nUnlike democratic systems where representatives claim to channel \"majority will\" (an impossible fiction), markets at least honestly show their brutality. But both trap individuals without real choice.\n\n**Multiple Dimensions of Poisoned Thrownness**:\n- **Physical**: Plastics, chemicals, pollution unavoidable\n- **Aesthetic**: Ugliness, soul-crushing environments\n- **Social**: Isolation, no resonant communities\n- **Mental**: Addiction systems (porn, gaming, social media)\n- **Economic**: All paths lead to same trap\n\nBehind all of these: No way to make the intended signal of demand become supply signal sufficient for it realizing. No way for will to coalesce. No way for emotion, e.g. about externalities, to economically matter or cause will coalesence.\n\n### 19.5 The Terraformer Solution\n\nHeidegger recognized that thrownness at scale requires transformation at scale. Individual escape isn't enough when the whole landscape is poisoned.\n\n**The Philosophical Insight**:\nBreaking collective thrownness requires:\n- Will powerful enough to reshape reality\n- Vision clear enough to attract followers\n- Courage to transform fundamental conditions\n\n**The Crucible Implementation**:\nInstead of one terraformer imposing new thrownness on all, we get thousands or millions of terraformers creating choosable worlds:\n\n- **Bottom-up coalescence** vs top-down enforcement\n- **Voluntary rallying** vs forced compliance\n- **Exit rights sacred** vs expansion imperative\n- **Natural selection** vs imposed selection\n\n### 19.6 Dictatorship as Legitimate Choice\n\nIn the Crucible system, what would be tyranny becomes legitimate sovereignty:\n\nA visionary leader who:\n- Articulates powerful vision for specific daemonia\n- Attracts voluntary followers through rallying\n- Rules absolutely within their domain\n- Cannot expand beyond willing participants\n\nThis transforms concentrated will from threat to asset because:\n- **Higher-order consent**: People choose which ship to board. Which Thrownness to accept. (Holistic conception of Environment and Oneself and Others)\n- **Exit rights**: Can leave anytime. (Rule 3 of BC (Which is attempted to become Ubiquity Law (No one refusing it (System is designed to empower dissent into real. But at a tradeoff. BC is designed to align as many as possible towards empowering the consequence of denying BC. (0 is Might reality... That codifies that no one should delude themselves in breaking The Halo attempted Ubiquity Law of BC as 0 to enforce it by levarage, laurels and raw might is made clear. But also making it clear, that since 0 is THAT kind of power sufficient and capable, then also IT can violate it. And so, it also offers an avenue of unacceptable \"letting THAT GUY live\" emotions, by bubbling the deathwish to the Reality of Might.(Ultimately 0 is necessary, if not now, then at some point. Progress entails raw power domination by \u2663 or \u2666 at some point. Whatever that entity or intelligence controlling raw might may be. From stupid Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWs) to elaborate AI systems controlled by \u2663 or counter-will-acceptance of \u2663s (whatever the latest \u2663 is, it does) or \u2666 rule by analysis of \u2663s to the hopeless Matrix scenario where no \u2663 is input sufficient to significantly perturb \u2666 function))))))\n- **Competition**: Other visions available\n- **Natural limits**: Only grows through attraction\n\nStrong leadership, concentrated will, and transformative vision become constructive forces when channeled through voluntary association rather than territorial conquest.\n\n### 19.7 The Will to Transform\n\nWhat matters isn't preventing concentration of will but enabling its constructive expression:\n\n**Each sovereignty represents**:\n- A particular \"color\" of will made manifest, purely that colour, so that we may see also exactly what that colour is like. Purity and bigotted harsh discrimination made ultimate diversity of the world enrichment mechanism.\n- A solution to specific forms of thrownness or alternative as if \"new thrownness\" attempts.\n- An experiment in human flourishing\n- A beacon for those who resonate\n\nWhen millions of such visions compete stubbornly tight to THAT WILL of their Sovereign (\u2663 or \u2666) through rallying rather than conquest:\n- True pluralism emerges (Preference for \u2663 promotes true human diversity. Preference to \u2666 can be engineered to promote non-human willed diversity. Like \"The Compromise emergences\" or other esoteric functions of \u2663s aggregations or system guessing. That may become willed by experiencing it and emoting very well with it.)\n- Genuine choice becomes real\n- Escape from being locked to ones thrownness\n- Human potential unleashes\n\n### 19.8 Breaking the Races to Bottom\n\nNSS and its contextual systems breaks locked positions through multiple mechanisms:\n\n**Infrastructure Liberation**:\nWhen basic needs cost ~0, the pressure to accept bad deals evaporates:\n- Don't need 30-year mortgage when housing costs approach marginal; And why even own a house? Many will probably choose to move between Triads and experience many 'lives' before deciding such a high-investment as building a Triad of your own or having a house constructed according to their vision and in harmony with the place and people.\n- Don't accept soul-crushing job when basics are covered\n- Don't participate in races that diminish everyone\n- Base-sustenance version of pragma-love mating/partnering is removed for those having adopted the system. (\"I married him/her to have a place to sleep and eat and see my children no longer suffer from such want nor fear starving\" You may say that I'm a dreamer. But where would we be if no one did.)\n\n**Multiple Worlds Available**:\nThe Crucible ensures you're not thrown into one world but can choose among thousands:\n- Different economic systems\n- Different aesthetic realities\n- Different social structures\n- Different values manifest\n- Different biological substrate\n- Any philosophical exaltation made law of the land or none at all, but living under raw will of a person or multiple paradoxical willing persons.\n\n**Terraforming Possibilities**:\nHigh-leverage actors can reshape landscapes:\n- But only for voluntary participants (Higher consent)\n- With competition from other terraformers\n- Subject to natural selection (including ability to manifest visions and rallying persons; where the former is almost always a matter of the latter. Which is made as true and discoverable as possible with contextual systems. Like Aiddaemon and Trust Networks and Actualizational layer for Will-coalesence)\n- With exit preventing lock-in\n\n### 19.9 The Meta-Choice\n\nThe deepest transformation: thrownness itself becomes choosable.\n\n**From**: Born into system, no alternatives, must accept the given\n**To**: Choose what can be chosen about your thrownness, multiple options, can exit and re-choose. Serenity Prayer made as capable as possible in strength to and wisdom to discern with as clear trade-off as humanity permits.\n\nThis meta-choice - the ability to select which world you're thrown into - represents the ultimate liberation from inherited conditions while acknowledging that some form of thrownness is inherent to existence.\nNegative environmental effects becomes a choice. Positive ones made real opportunities easily naviagable.\n\n### 19.10 Integration with Core NSS Principles\n\nThese insights strengthen core NSS mechanisms:\n\n**Personal-cap rewards** ensure performance focus without parasitism\n**Domain-specific merit** redirects human drives constructively\n**Multiple terraformers** break a feeling of universal thrownness; utterly destroys the movement towards universal throwness (globalism) while enabling far greater potency in directing will towards leveraging another to care. And making Raw Might actors knowledgable about how to apply their power to enforce as cleanly as possible: with as little collateral as possible.\n**Exit rights** transform dictatorship dystopia into legitimate option and diversity optimizing local conditions. Aka. utopian dictatorships survive and thrive and have persons rallying. Dystopian ones die out. It makes Dictatorship de facto ONLY good over time. (This is a general consequence of holistic natural selection systems (NSS) It can be applied to anything when you root it in individual human subjective will/daemon/emotion/intent: Hence Polymorphic Crucible. Everything becomes wrapped or embedded in this.)\n**Trust networks** enable holistic value consideration and potency in economic or actualizational consequences for interrelational reality.\n\nThe system doesn't need to prevent \"bad\" actors or promote \"good\" ones. It needs only to enable will manifestation with exit rights, allowing natural selection among voluntary associations.\n\n### 19.11 True Representation: Will Made Manifest\n\n**The Democratic Fiction of Representation**\n\nDemocracy claims representatives embody \"the will of the people.\" This is impossible:\n- No single direction of choices can embody millions of diverse wills. Only the will implementing this system-equivalency-class can claim to embody millions of diverse wills. (aka. You can proclaim \"LIER LIER PANTS ON FIRE!\" to anyone claiming to be Will of the People without implementing these systems-equivalency-class will-manfiestation for the people it claims to try and represents: Total naked emperor of \"western liberal capitalist democracy\" )\n- Party platforms are crude singular political-zealots-work (philosophy they insist should dominate) made-movement become multiple-choice dilectic for the masses to be robbed of their will and dominated rigtheously by. Aka. In the name of representing your will, nowhere will your will be allowed expressed without going through the few party persons who represent your will. Aka Western Democracy.\n- Voting every few years provides minimal input. Comically low representation attempt. History will laugh hard. (Like, HOW! did the mass population fall for that... \"They are represented. So centralization and ever more domination by 'Their Will Representation' is justified.\")\n- Most decisions happen without any consultation\n- \"The people\" become abstraction, not reality\n\nCitizens are told: \"If you want change, vote and lobby. All else is evil/illegal. Individual power must be limited because it's 'undemocratic.'\" This creates learned helplessness where people complain the state should fix things but take no direct action -- Even if they do, most of their power has been extracted from them, leaving them little real power left; moreover any organization to pool power into will be called insurgency or terrorist activity: Traitorous even. It creates real consequences for trying to fix things. And it creates total disempowerment of trying to fix things (paracitical load of their throwness. Taxes, usury, market corruption, pricing by anticipated inflation, employment-traps, rent-seeking (ownership bought to profit as middlemen raising expenses), VAT, Private Vat Parasitism (market provision infrastructure VAT), product market access costs, massive inefficiencies of market and logistics and infrastructure/utilities causing massive waste; finance and money-flow by non-wealth generating work put into pseudo-employment and \"firework wealth\" demand; and borrowing (Your money is not current money supply, but future money supply, but differentiated upon who gets to borrow the most) and much much much more. >93% of productives work taken away).\n\n**NSS: Actual Will Coalescence**\n\nInstead of false representation, NSS enables true will manifestation:\n\n**Continuous Voting Through Life Choices**:\n```yaml\nEvery_Choice_Is_A_Vote:\n  where_you_shop: Supports those values\n  how_you_work: Enables those systems\n  what_you_consume: Funds those producers\n  who_you_trust: Strengthens those networks\n  where_you_live: Chooses that sovereignty\n```\n\n**AR/Aiddaemon Deep Intent Visibility**:\n- See will coalescence opportunities in real-time\n- Understand deep intent behind surface choices\n- Navigate to aligned options continuously\n- Vote with every step, not every 4 years\n\n**Will Diversity Preserved**:\n- 10,000 different expressions of collective will\n- Each sovereignty a different configuration\n- No forced averaging into \"the people\"\n- Actual diversity, not rhetorical\n\n**Direct Action Enabled**:\nInstead of \"state should fix it\" helplessness:\n- See problem \u2192 Discover & Create solution \u2192 Act & therefrom Deploy immediately\n- Performance speaks \u2192 Resources flow\n- No permission needed from \"representatives\"\n- Power through performance, not politics\n\n**Example: Transportation Will**\n```\nDemocratic System:\n- Vote for representative who vaguely mentions transit\n- Hope they remember after election\n- Wait years for maybe some action\n- Complain about traffic meanwhile\n- Buy a lot of transportation usage or products in hope of signal becoming supply. Only to see profitter hoard or use for random weird money flows. Dispersed into the wind. Oten into corporate administration without real substrate/service growth or efficiency increase. Often into bureaucratic processes or lawfare or other such human-entanglement problems. (Warren Buffet assumption in a non-corrupted market and unmanipulated money supply would perhaps make the signal not lost, as he would instantly reinvest where the money was spent, on account of his massive greed: Wanting to see that number go up and up and up. But fundamentally, it is without taste, without will, without daemon, and purely seeking to flow where value is created or at least ponzi scheme money predictively flow to. (The merits of prediction concerning finance and investment I have gone over before. But it is clear that it is all embedded in prediction and pathfinding of these systems. Thus all old finance and investment can be replaced with these new much more holistic and will-directed visionary versions))\n\nNSS System:\n- Want better transport \u2192 Create rideshare coalescence 'gossip' or 'service'. \u2192 Experience exponential NSS dynamics having made it\n- Deploy locally \u2192 Performance visible\n- Others adopt if superior \u2192 Scales naturally\n- Your utility ultimately improves or not will to manifest directly in reality; if it doesn't your will-coalescence at this higher level was poor: They didn't choose your pathway to fulfil their will.\n```\n\n**The Revolutionary Shift**:\n\nFrom: \"Only democratic power is legitimate\"\nTo: \"Power is natural; Natural Selection upon human subjectivity and performance as will-manifestation utility makes it as good as it good can be within a human-will-worth equality mindset\"\n\nFrom: \"Representatives speak for the people\"  \nTo: \"People speak cheaply or with higher intent (sometimes lying and delusional) through their words and expressions; But if empowered to understand how acts align across their 'values' or 'being' (daemon) then they speak most strongly through their choices: How does their intentions value between each other. What are the truths about the worth to each they refuse or are unable to voice or word.\"\nThis is strongly related to self-pity mentality. Which, while in a 'bad state' one allows oneself to excuse and change the valuations they otherwise proclaim. It is a dangerous mentality to normalize and it becomes a very deep thorn in one's character; which fundamentally isn't excusable. It is exactly when it requires pain or sacrifice, when it isn't easy, that the trade-off or valuations: What is important; is revealed. It is hard to divest oneself of, if internalized behaviour and mentality; speaking from personal experience.\n\nFrom: \"Change requires political process\"\nTo: \"Creation requires space, matter and will; The rest is overhead obstacles. Change of what is, requires better will-performance\" (See The Crucible and MIRA & Hearths)\n\nFrom: \"Individual power is dangerous\"\nTo: \"System, Consensus, Aggregation, Weighted-votes, intricate neural networks is dangerous -- especially if cemented into physical power. Plurality of Individual excellence and space and purity-density of expression serves all\"\n\n**True Representation Achieved**:\n\nThe will of the people isn't a fiction spoken by representatives\u2014it's the actual pattern of choices, associations, and movements made actuable-visible for coalescence by trust networks and through such things as AR LLL games or AR systems or any other interface. Every person votes continuously through their actions, every sovereignty represents a genuine will configuration, and the aggregate creates true collective intelligence without fake unity. The decisive moment of 'voting' becomes 'rallying' or movement of body into another place -- another way of life; another Triad.\n\nThis is democracy's promise finally delivered: genuine rule by the people, through their actual choices rather than their supposed representatives.\nThe Liberal Democratic Ideal or Intent manifest and not its own denial and lying name. The embedding that makes tolerance of all things intolerant liberal and good. The more intolerant the more pure expression and ability to 'see that colour of humanity too' we shall have.\n\n## 20. Conclusion: Embracing Designed Brutality {#conclusion}\n\n### 20.1 The Five Pillars of Genius\n\nNSS succeeds through designed brutality:\n\n1. **Enables** exponential growth (the promise)\n2. **Makes it** zero-sum within domains (the pressure)\n3. **Within** holistic optimization (the purpose (\u2666 or \u2663 (or \u2663s: this makes them overwrite each other. \"Cookie clicker\" will advantage. Otherwise it is \u2666 system above)))\n4. **Creating** logistic reality (the truth)\n5. **Driving** system evolution (the result)\n\n### 20.2 The Fundamental Transformation\n\nWe're not reforming capitalism\u2014we're replacing its core mechanism:\n\n**From**: Capital commands all domains\n**To**: Will-Performance commands specific domains; Which downstream can mean Capital-\u2666-systemization decides all command. Or things like Dictator or Y-Virtuous Man dictates or commands all things. But it is all fundamentally embedded in Natural Selection upon **disentangled** subjective/**individual** human will/deamon: The Inverted Pyramid part to the Sky-reflected Fractal Pyramid. (See Tolkien Prophecy)\n\n**From**: Employment gatekeeps innovation\n**To**: Functions flow to performers and ownership is by creation/innovation or per-product transaction. Not contract binding creations to be another's.\n\n**From**: Artificial scarcity maintains profits\n**To**: Natural **WILLED** abundance *AND* scarcity through competition (You can have your plastic abundance all you want, but others will absolutely refuse your abundance. Or Pod Life apartments and cubicles abundance. And so on. And so on. Abundance by itself is as myopic and stupid as the Paperclip machine producer of Vulnerable World Hypothesis by Nick Bostrom: NoBODY wants abundance unqualified or unconditionally. They want abundance of very particular things at particular moments; and crucially SCARCITY of ALMOST EVERYTHING CONCEIVABLE ALWAYS.)\n**To**: Natural will-abundance through natural selection competition substrates. (Will-abundance defined as: Abundance of Daring to Will & Manifestation of it (See [Tentative Bastards](./28%20tentative-bastards-subjective-economics.md) (Allowing Richness and Plurality of The Planet. Allowing for a world eternally worth exploring. In the long term I predict Metagames of World Dynamics will become popular. Willing to gamble real massive territory - losses and wins - lasting centuries (The 'Sportsballs' that Will Matter))))\n\n**From**: Merit theft enables extraction\n**To**: Merit hiding & protection by Trust and Will-leverage empowerment is conducive for daring and wanting to innovate; moreover being able to grow across substrates in exponential fashion is a massive incentive. No nonsense obstacles: If you will-perform, you win bigly. No bureacracy or out-of-field considerations need bother you.\n\n**From**: False democratic representation\n**To**: Domination or Control or Pownership VISIBLE and CHOSEN. Genuine choice through exit rights. Massive facilitation of your own Dominum to be truly FREE IN - including against other will: You becoming the Dominator.\n\n**From**: \"Justified\" killing cycles\n**To**: Absolute prohibition: banishment as if dead (Transitive total denial of any interactions that end up connecting you to that person (Trust Network positions the person as a \\[Strong Zero\\]. Which causes all calculation to go to 0 trust by any quantity touch. (Including any cardinality infinities etc) It becomes an ultimatum for others to become ostracized AS IF DEAD TO THEM by having any interaction with the \"Banished as if Dead\" person. (This is the meaning of killing or murder in a deathless world to come. \"Hardline Phase Death\" (This is one of the strongest leverage acts one can impose. It means total disconnection and disjointedness instantly. Not even divergence. Hard segmentation of actuality and total non-refusal of interaction on any connection in actuality: Harshly cutting out anyone unwilling to entirely cut off all interaction. Often it can mean simply parting in a vessel from it all into your own actuality with the few others. Sometimes it can cause a cascade. Your choice; Their choice; Moment to moment; Never a \"forever\" never an end to \"second chances\". Guess you can call it The Mercy of The Pentagram, Figure \\#5 or Lucifer's Mercy))))\n\n**From**: \"Only democracy legitimates power\"\n**To**: Performance legitimates naturally (This is synonym of \"Might is Right\". But Trust Networks enable all that isn't might to matter potently.)\n\n**From**: Complaining \"state should fix it\"\n**To**: Direct action through choice after choice empowered and made potent by the will-coalesence and other contextual parts to it. Your full leverage potential -- in combination with others -- in potentials -- made naviagable and therefore as clear choices, step by step, as you go about your life.\n\n### 20.3 The Beautiful Brutality\n\nThe harshness IS the kindness:\n- Brutal competition creates user abundance\n- Massive intolerance creates plurality and wisdom of crowds effects and removes gaming actors to dominate (See Tolkien Prophecy WoC & Goodhart's Law).\n- Zero-sum battles produce positive-sum outcomes (efficiency and surplus used for growth into novel exotic variants)\n- Evolution pressure ensures continuous improvement (It is the dynamic that solves Goodhart's Law problems. Something every gamer have realized over time. Natural Selection of items, balance and the landscape in general causes 'badness' to be internally in the game solved. Take WoW or Starcraft. In starcraft they try to fix balance by map creation and meta-gaming. But it could be within the unit-structure.)\n- Natural selection prevents stagnation\n\n### 20.4 The Choice Before Us\n\nHumanity faces a decision:\n\n**Path A**: Maintain control systems until catastrophic failure\n- Increasing inefficiency\n- Innovation stagnation  \n- Resource waste\n- Eventual collapse\n\n(One might be tempted to go amnesia on these documents and simply \"let it happen\". But then again... Forgive them for they know not what they do. But then again... To suffer one's philosophy or beliefs, at least a little bit... Enough such that they should know...)\n\n**Path B**: Enable natural selection\n- Immediate disruption\n- Exponential improvement\n- Resource abundance\n- Continuous evolution\n\n### 20.5 The Irreversible Future\n\nOnce NSS reaches critical mass:\n- Performance advantages compound\n- Network effects accelerate\n- Traditional systems can't compete\n- Evolution becomes unstoppable\n\n### 20.6 The Call to Evolution\n\nNSS doesn't require universal adoption. It needs only:\n- One major player to light the match\n- Trust networks to form connections\n- Performance to speak louder than politics\n- Natural selection to operate freely\n\n### 20.7 Final Words\n\nThe Natural Selection System represents evolution becoming conscious of itself and applying itself to human civilization. It transforms:\n\n- Infrastructure from static to evolving\n- Economics from extraction to creation\n- Governance from false representation to genuine choice\n- Innovation from lottery to guarantee\n- Humanity from controlled to unleashed\n- Human work from gatekeeping to connection-building\n- Democracy from fiction to reality through continuous choice\n\nThe protocol doesn't eliminate human work\u2014it transforms it into something deeper. As machines optimize functions, humans build the trust networks that enable everything else. We become the architects of connection, the witnesses of value, the bridges between communities.\n\nMost crucially, NSS ends the fundamental lies of current systems:\n- That capital should command all domains\n- That representatives can embody millions of wills\n- That killing can ever be \"just\" (leading to endless revenge cycles)\n- That people must accept systems they're born into\n- That only democratic processes create legitimate power\n- That individual excellence is dangerous rather than beneficial\n\nInstead, it enables true choice through voluntary association, genuine performance-based growth, and escape from inherited thrownness. Power through performance becomes as legitimate as power through voting\u2014more so, because it's based on reality rather than rhetoric.\n\nThe protocol awaits activation. The infrastructure yearns to evolve. The future selects itself.\n\nWhat works, wins.\n\nNot through force but through performance. Not through mandate but through competition. Not through revolution but through evolution.\n\n**Welcome to the age where merit flows to its creators, where excellence commands resources, where performance is the only currency that matters, where no one is trapped in systems they didn't choose, and where the absolute prohibition on killing ends the cycles of \"justified\" revenge that have plagued humanity.**\n\nThe revolution doesn't require permission. Evolution has already begun.\n\n---\n\n*End of Document*\n\n*For implementation details, see technical appendices. For philosophical depth, see referenced works.

Even IF this were true (it isn't), it commits a catastrophic category error: collapsing all competence into one dimension.\n\n### The One-Dimensional Collapse\n\nConsider the absurdity:\n- Excel at predatory lending \u2192 Control water infrastructure\n- Master market manipulation \u2192 Direct healthcare systems\n- Perfect tax evasion \u2192 Command energy networks\n- Monopolize social media \u2192 Decide food distribution\n\nCapital transforms domain-specific performance into universal command authority. This is insane.\n\n## The Corrupt Reality\n\n### How Capital Actually Accumulates\n\nFar from representing value creation, capital accumulates through:\n\n**Anti-Supply**: Creating artificial scarcity\n- Patent trolling preventing innovation\n- Regulatory capture blocking competition\n- Monopolistic restriction of production\n- Hoarding resources to inflate prices (Compute power is one example of resource restriction. We can make computers ubiquitous if we wanted, made out of very abundant materials, and massified. The scarcity or pricing of compute power is entirely artificial. To prove it I guess I can do garage compute units in abundance.)\n\n**Pollution Profits**: Externalizing costs\n- Environmental destruction uncounted\n- Health damage unpaid\n- Future generations robbed\n- Commons depleted for private gain\n- General direction on any aspect of the world the production and profit causes.\n\n**Financial Manipulation**: Gaming the system\n- Derivatives multiply claims on real value \n    a. Imaginary wealth, like 'expected' value of an abstraction like a company, derivatives too gets counted in this 'expected' sense as real value. (\"Added to the economy\" or \"Wiped off the economy\" and \"paper share in the 'expected value abstraction' sold adding to GDP\")\n    b. Derivative market is 6 orders of magnitude (factor 10e6) larger than money supply. It can function like a domino trap of wealth extraction upon collapse.\n- Currency manipulation destroys savings; One large version is borrowing, another is currency/money inflation as part of a state program.\n    a. Modern borrowing is equivalent to \"pretended is real\" ('expected value greater by pretending than not') and in any case it is equivalent to investment of bank-stored wealth by banker instead of by wealth-owner (You can call it asset management like Blackrock, Vanguard or Blackstone but where it isn't explicit and the investment proceduce barely profits you if it works and is subsidized by state if it fails -- or modern equivalent: Simply is inflation of money supply and thus devaluation of the wealth you have stored)\n- Debt traps extract perpetually. Put everyone in debt at multiple levels of interaction (One of the many layers of parasitism by being the Master of Investment or 'Who preemptively gets power'): \n    a. Your personal posessions: Your house (mortgage), your car and other personal possessions\n    b. Every company you deal with has debt they must incur costs unto the consumer with\n    c. Every state is in debt from which the taxes you pay must have ~10% extracted from in US case; Though they then borrow more money than they pay in interest -- This is burn out xor money corruption / economic abundance / victory strategy. One could conceivably imagine a government making everyone 'get more' by borrowing like this. But they do not do that, and why would they? 'Get More' on totally imaginary lines of 'was there now there fiat increase' means 'what is less somewhere else'. Which again is all about 'good or bad investment'. And to weave it into context of systems: At least try to think good will-investment. More holistic than merely did I latch onto a share that turned a profit better than another place.\n    d. Any other example of having borrowed money with usury causes a layer of debt.\n    e. Complement of devaluation of rest of money supply that is 'hard earned' and not preemptively conjured preferentially for those the Lender chooses.\n    f. When it collapses by insane money creation/distribution or investment/redistribution that is detached from 'wealth creation'. Then the big money institutions are bailed out to continue their process of doing this again. Causing 'the regular crisis' where the many will take a more tangible hit to their wealth. The Man Who Fought The Banks. (Consider how these systems replaces banks and borrowing. Banks becomes securely storing wealth. Investment Banks becomes securely storing wealth or otherwise continually applying them towards the aims of the wealth-owning part. And Borrowing becomes 'acting' -- You don't need to pass 'money', you can 'act' what they need help with, not releasing ownership of it or provide 'access or control of'. You do the 'direct thing' instead of the indirect thing. It goes for 'helping other states fight off Bad Bear Putin Rus Rus', you 'act it' you don't give power to \"Good Iron Man Zelenskyii et al to save the world for you however that looks in will of theirs'\" (Cold War Doctrine lunacy causes this. See [Might With Right](29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md)))\n    g. Having positioned yourself in debt to your neck to have four walls and a roof (most persons). That means you can not borrow money for general will-impact upon the world. And instead will have your 'excess wealth' to 'do things with' severely limited. Some persons manage to get corporate loans. But, most big and good loans (preemptively creation or investment by lender bank) is granted to those 'in the network of good connections' already.\n    h. Interbanking loans are also a big thing...... (Oh, you do get a profit from the 'investments' and usury of the bank by storing money in the (investment (lends money)) bank.. But only from the profits of course... But the banks that profit bigly of course are not publically traded and in total secrecy of who profits how and what their wealth is. This is why Forbes Richest persons list is dominated by publically traded share-owners like Musk, Gates, Bezos and so on. But they are certainly NOT the richest. And certainly not at all in power to impact the world. (Their corporations are limited impact and their money is bound in stock that allows them to command their corporations (usually.)))\n    ...\n    q. ..... And it goes on and on and on. And this is only borrow lend and also usury parasitism. Which isn't AT ALL all the parasitism a person experiences. Which includes corporations profits, market corruption, taxes, vat, private infrastructure VAT with endless profit motives, rent seeking ownership middle men to profit on all, and so on.\n    x. Amortizations and Dismal Science aggretation blind analysis causing 'things that are not equal to be viewed equal' causing further extraction from high end of that which is wrongly considered equal.\n    \u00f8. But hey... If you live in a welfare state, they can only extract from your work if you make money. So you can simply go 'comfy squad' and lean back on the dole.\n    \u00e5. Also overpriced 'to have a life' services: Like education and sickness treatment. Which causes many to 'I need the best' and pay up causing massive debt. Whether, through a state or individual actor. But of course, as individual actor you only have multiple choice and no leverage. But as a state you can make your own options as well and you have leverage to bargain less parasitism (If state isn't too inept -- Which they usually are -- Or attacked as it being immoral for a state by its own traitorous citizens to try at bargaining a good deal against a 'private corporation'.) (All of this: SOLVED. It doesn't take revolution. Only making space.)\n\n**Human Capture**: Owning others' productivity\n- Employment contracts claiming innovation\n- Non-compete agreements trapping talent (Insane........ 'Nope, you can no longer do what you're good at and have dedicated your life to. Because it would be less nice profit situation for your former merit extracting employer')\n- Student debt creating desperation\n- Immigration status enabling exploitation; It also creates a negative spiral of labour within a country. Where, the demand for workers is massively lowered while simultaneously the workers suddenly get a \"worst global standards\" perspective, which moves the \"acceptable conditions of employment\" massively towards \"anything so long as I can get away from 'bad place' or 'have a chance in better world' and so on\". This in turn lowers the incentive to become a worker as a citizen or growing up there, having that national/west perspective, which in turns allows for further influx of immigrant workers with more dependency on immigration. Where, one could reasonably argue: \"The place that needs good workers the most, are those places they come from or worse, and certainly not the most developed places\". But, instead, we get: \"If you can. Anywhere in the world. Anything useful. Then please: Leave your place and go to capital lands\". Where, one coudl reasonably argue: \"But capital is mere 'lubrication' of getting men to do things and parting resources one way or another. So why doesn't capital come to them?\". Where, one could reasonably argue: \"Because having capital flow to such places is too risky. From governments to crime to deceit or vandalism. Theft of property or state seizing of it all.\". To which one could respond: \"Therefore a need to make local pockets of 'western standard civility' where all who 'fit in civilized terms' from those places can leave to and have peace from destroyers to build.\" (See [Neo-colonialism](./32.%20neo-colonialism.md))\n\n**Deception Industries**: Fake value\n- Marketing creating false needs\n- Planned obsolescence forcing repurchase\n- Financial products designed to confuse\n- Complexity hiding extraction\n- Psychological signals with no depth to them. \"To what end does these goods or service serve?\". The postulate being: \"Whatever psychological nicety you may claim is the aim, can be had as a side-effect towards a real end.\" (End of Hedonism markets: \"When pleasure becomes peaks and emergent\". (See [Living in The Crucible](./35.%20living-in-new-world.md)))\n\n### The Ultimate Perversion\n\nThose who accumulate capital through harm gain control over society's productive resources. The destroyer of value commands the creation of value. The poisoner controls the medicine. The monopolist directs the innovation.\n\n## The Natural Selection Alternative\n\n### Direct Performance Competition\n\nThe new system obliterates capital's universal proxy status:\n\n**Domain-Specific Excellence**:\n- Good at routing packets? Grow in networking\n- Efficient at energy distribution? Expand in power\n- Excellent at food logistics? Scale in agriculture\n- Brilliant at computation? Command more compute\n\nBut ONLY in domains where you demonstrate performance.\n\n### No Fee Entry\n\n**Traditional System**:\n```\nIdea \u2192 Need Capital \u2192 Beg Investors \u2192 Give Up Control \u2192 Maybe Implement \u2192 Probably Fail\n```\n\n**Natural Selection System**:\n```\nIdea \u2192 Implement Minimum Version \u2192 Perform Better \u2192 Grow Automatically \u2192 Keep Evolving\n```\n\n### The Protocol Mechanics\n\nAnyone can enter with:\n- A person and their will\n- A tiny compute node\n- A small energy generation unit\n- A simple routing improvement\n- Any marginally better solution\n\nIf it performs better, it grows. No permission needed. No capital required. No gatekeepers to convince.\n\n## Real Examples of Domain Selection\n\n### Computation Evolution\n\n**Old**: Amazon accumulated capital through retail monopolization, uses it to control cloud computing despite no inherent competence in infrastructure\n\n**New**: Teenager discovers optimal GPU scheduling algorithm\n- Implements on their gaming PC\n- Achieves 3x better utilization\n- Compute tasks route to them automatically\n- Growth proportional to performance advantage\n- Amazon's capital cannot stop this\n\n### Energy Distribution\n\n**Old**: Oil company profits buy control of renewable infrastructure, operates it poorly to protect fossil fuel investments\n\n**New**: Local engineer designs superior grid balancing system\n- Tests with neighborhood microgrid\n- Reduces waste by 40%\n- More users connect seeking efficiency\n- System expands based on results\n- Oil capital becomes irrelevant\n\n### Food Networks\n\n**Old**: Financial speculation profits control agricultural distribution, optimizing for trading gains not feeding people\n\n**New**: Farmer cooperative creates direct distribution network\n- Fresher food, lower waste\n- Consumers prefer it\n- Network grows organically\n- Speculators can't compete on performance\n- Capital yields to competence\n\n## The Crony Capitalism Funeral\n\n### What Dies\n\n**Crony Capitalism's Tools**:\n- Regulatory capture (performance ignores regulations)\n- Market manipulation (reality can't be gamed)\n- Monopolistic practices (better solutions route around)\n- Political influence (physics doesn't vote)\n- Capital barriers (unnecessary for entry)\n\n**Crony Capitalism's Victims**:\n- Innovative solutions blocked by incumbents\n- Efficient systems destroyed by monopolists\n- Human potential trapped in corporate hierarchy\n- Resources wasted on artificial barriers\n- Progress stalled by rent-seeking\n\n### What Lives\n\n**Domain-Specific Natural Selection**:\n- Every domain evolves independently\n- Excellence cannot be transferred via capital\n- Performance in reality determines growth\n- Continuous evolution prevents stagnation\n- Resources flow to actual utility\n\n## The All Things Considered Protocol\n\n### Beyond Simple Metrics\n\nNatural selection considers ALL factors:\n- Raw performance metrics\n- Reliability over time\n- Trust network feedback\n- Externality management\n- Evolutionary adaptability\n- Systemic harmony\n\n### Example: Energy Supplier Selection\n\n**Traditional**: Cheapest price wins (ignoring pollution, reliability, future availability)\n\n**Natural Selection All Things Considered**:\n- Price: 0.15 units\n- Reliability: 99.9% uptime\n- Carbon impact: Negative (renewable)\n- Trust score: 94.7\n- Evolution rate: Improving 5% monthly\n- Network effects: Strengthens local grid\n\nConsumers choosing \"all things considered\" create evolutionary pressure toward true optimization, not narrow financial gaming.\n\n## The Beautiful Brutality\n\nThis system is ruthless toward:\n- Incompetence hiding behind capital\n- Rent-seeking without value creation\n- Monopolistic inefficiency\n- Cross-domain capital imperialism\n- Performance theater replacing reality\n\nThis system rewards:\n- Domain-specific excellence\n- Continuous improvement\n- Genuine value creation\n- Efficient resource utilization\n- Reality-based performance\n\n## The Transition\n\nWe're witnessing the early stages:\n- Open source destroying software monopolies\n- Peer-to-peer undermining financial gatekeepers\n- Mesh networks routing around telecoms\n- Distributed energy challenging utilities\n- Direct democracy bypassing representatives\n\nEach victory proves the principle: **performance beats capital when given a fair fight**.\n\n## The Final Vision\n\nA world where:\n- Excellence in one domain doesn't grant control over others\n- Resources flow to those who use them best\n- Entry requires only better ideas, not capital\n- Evolution operates freely on all systems\n- Natural selection replaces crony capitalism\n\nNot through regulation or revolution, but through simple protocol: **perform better in reality, grow bigger in that domain**.\n\nCapital's universal command ends. Domain-specific competence begins. The specialist who serves brilliantly outcompetes the generalist who owns blindly. Reality becomes the only judge. Performance becomes the only currency.\n\nWelcome to the post-capital world where what works wins, where it works."}, {"path": "system share/foundations/24b employment.md", "title": "24b employment.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# The End of Employment Gatekeeping: When Infrastructure Becomes Open to Performance\n\n## The Current Employment Prison\n\nDifference between a State and a Corporation:\n                            State               | Corporation\nEscape                      No not really       | Yes\nPhysical Force              Yes                 | No\nSovereign Domination        Yes                 | No\nSovereign Person            Rarely. Deemed Evil | Yes; A Board; Stockholders\n\nState is a 'more powerful' corporation. Embedded in The Crucible, there is no problem in going from corporation to state power, in fact one can easily transition from a corporation to a state by making a Triad. In that sense States and Corporations are the same thing. And the Communism Capitalism Social Democratic and Libertarian and so on discussion ends. It is all a matter of 'who' gets to dominate 'how'. Which is the crux of [The Crucible](27.%20The%20Sovereign%20Crucible%20and%20the%20Might%20Is%20Right%20Alliance%20--%20A%20Framework%20for%20Will-Based%20Civilizations.md): Plurality and Natural Selection / Rallying. Higher order consent to embark upon living in a Triad. When it isn't orderly and explicit domination or rule, then see [Will-coalescence](12%20will_coalescence_meta_utility.md) or perhaps more poignantly see [MoWD](28%20Metagame%20of%20World%20Dynamics.md) and [Might With Right](29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md).\n\n### How Employment Blocks Natural Selection\n\n**Traditional System**: Employment as Exclusion\n- It occupies 'a share of the industry' for a few hands without any ability for others to compete. It all goes through proxies and bureaucracy to then occupy a position. This isn't only employment, but more generally 'Expert Systems' and Categorical thinking: \"This person solves and is responsible for [category]. Everyone else is not and totally disbarred\". It cuts the possibility of acts in the real world into very limited and long processes by historical data or proxies like education/schooling/degrees to select what is allowed to happen in terms of acts. It is useful when you have to be able to justify any failure and remove responsibility from yourself. But it is very poor in steering a ship and dealing with reality. \"What lunacy to hire a person falling between or outside [categories] that is [type] for that [function]\". That causes it all to be stupid and brittle. Any attempt at using more information than the projective space of being [category] or [type] for the [function] results in being called not only irresponsible but also stupid and evil! (See [Neologistic Reality Cutting](30.%20neologistic-reality-cutting.md))\n- On top of that, you get locking down of employees or interactors/trade-partners within a company and in the case they leave the company. A sort of willingness to take risk by having locked potential and persons down into a non-threatening position. This easily becomes a violation of MBC rule 3. (Free Somewhere i.e. you can't 'outside' your triad do any such domination; They can leave and be free -- without the burden of your accord. Also remember Rule 1 and 2 in terms of causing it. Free restricted by those two things. (Rest is nesting.. Not ubiquity law. Which allows for escape and exit to be free.) Cause and Effect 0 position Horns and Halos etc. etc. etc.)\n    a. Work for utility company \u2192 Can't compete with utility\n    b. Employed by AWS \u2192 Can't offer better compute solutions\n    c. Contract with telecom \u2192 Can't improve the network (They have to let the binding law or contract run out, so they can stop what is stupid to them and develop upon the network. Sometimes ways around or cooperation with the telecom giant can be had. But it is usually with them getting the scalable profit and further positioning them as the masters in the domain - not by merit or excellence - but by position and law. Exit, escape, barriers, going free, etc. It helps. It really does. Simply say: Goodbye old world.)\n    d. Hired by any firm \u2192 Can't use \"their\" infrastructure better; Despite 'their infrastructure' may largely have been invented by that very same person. Unable to develop upon it. But is forced to 'start over' and see if they can innovate as well in a new way. Which is unlikely - or at least very annoying to be forced out of one's invention by entrapment of 'becoming employed': Having your potential you express owned by others.\n\n**The Artificial Barriers**:\n- Non-compete agreements\n- IP assignment clauses\n- Exclusive infrastructure access\n- Trade secret restrictions\n- Customer relationship ownership\n- \"Company property\" definitions\n\n### The Absurdity\n\nConsider the insanity:\n- Network engineer sees inefficiency in routing \u2192 Can't fix it without quitting\n- Power plant operator knows better scheduling \u2192 Contractually forbidden from implementing\n- Data center technician has optimization idea \u2192 Must give it to employer or suppress it\n- Delivery driver finds better routes \u2192 Can't start competing service using same roads\n\nThe person closest to the problem, most knowledgeable about the solution, is legally prevented from solving it!\n\n## The Open Infrastructure Revolution\n\n### Infrastructure as Evolutionary Substrate\n\nIn the new paradigm:\n- Infrastructure or more generally Substrate becomes open to anyone (Trust Maps / Networks; Usually a civilization or even world level substrate will be common) who can use it better\n- Employment status irrelevant to access rights; In fact employment is recommended illegal: Servitude by Contract. It is very bad for large scale Triads to have such binding within their massive zones. The point is dynamic, responsive exiting and rallying as a key metric of success that is \"all things considered\" holistic per subject. When you allow for Ocean or Sea wide 'contracts' that bind, then they can not 'go free' without leaving your civilization/sea/ocean.\n- Will-Performance determines who routes through what (Not only performance, but subjective will-performance, Owner <-> utilizer <-> Utility-User. Whether this Owner part is totally void in your Triad is up to you. Perhaps you want only Pwnership. Perhaps you want Sovereign Owner of all substrate. Perhaps you want Utilizer/effiency-maker to 'conquer' also ownership of substrate. It is up to you. The point remains of 'functioning' being will-performance competition across substrate so long as 'trust' or more generally 'will' is sufficient to allow competiting in substrate.)\n- Natural selection operates on all things of reality, not \"firms\" (abstractions of servitude and ownership).\n\n### Real Examples\n\n**Electricity Grid**\n- **Old**: Only utility employees can manage grid operations\n- **New**: Anyone who can route power more efficiently gains access\n- Engineer at utility develops better algorithm? Can implement directly\n- Competing implementations run simultaneously\n- Best will-performance wins the routing (Where efficiency in metrics of watt in and out being as wasteless and cheap being 'useful' or sometimes 'correlated' with will-performance. But obviously: cheap can easily capture and correlate very poorly with will-performance. Having low heat dissipation or waste is perhaps more generally correlated, but you could imagine the method to make it requiring many processes or acts or use-of-scarce-resources on the planet that makes it highly anti-will-performant. The Curse of Low-d or projective analysis. When you don't use holistic measures and mechanisms like Natural Selection. Implicit versus Explicit. 'All Things Considered' Adaptive (See [Blob Classes](4%20blob_classes_discovery.md)) Explicits versus Categorical or A Metric Space Explicits (Ryan Faulk -- Basically, Ryan did a lot of work on Implicit Versus Explicit. I wrote a lot about it since 2020 or something. Then copied massively and the typical academia rats and 'public intellectuals' thieving the merit and so on. So whatever. You know them now. And Goodbye to them and their kind forever. (Basically Jewry And Intelligence derivatives of The West. Fare thee well you hateful bastards.)))\n\n**Computing Infrastructure**\n- **Old**: Only AWS employees can optimize AWS infrastructure; Or interoperate or complement AWS directly.\n- **New**: Anyone can offer better scheduling for existing hardware; Or complementary hardware with software able to discover and utilize it. (As an example: extreme edge hardware (As an example see [Cohesion Net](6%20cohesionnet_use_case.md)))\n- Your algorithm outperforms? Compute routes to your scheduler\n- Hardware owner benefits from better utilization\n- You profit from performance delta\n\n**Network Routing**\n- **Old**: Only telecom employees touch routing tables\n- **New**: Anyone can propose better paths through existing fiber\n- Your prediction of connectivity pathways reduces latency? Increases stability&robustness? Has way less bottleneck infrastructure use? Traffic prefers your routes\n- Infrastructure owners earn more from efficiency\n- You earn from improvement margin\n\n## The Protocol Mechanics\n\n### How Employment Becomes Irrelevant\n\n```\nTraditional Employment Logic:\nIF employed_by(company) THEN exclusive_access(company_resources)\nELSE no_access\n\nNatural Selection Logic:  \nIF holistic-metric-by-proxy-of-human-will-performance(your_method) > ..-performance(current_method) \nTHEN resources_flow_to(your_method)\nREGARDLESS_OF employment_status\n```\n\n### The Beautiful Simplicity\n\nAnyone can:\n1. Observe inefficiency in any system\n2. Develop better approach; Develop variants to be projected by protocol.. \n3. Offer it to the network; ..protocol onto substrate for coordinated and large-scale Natural Selection.\n4. Get routed resources if superior; Routed resources in explosive fashion in any will-manifesting niche that can be found.\n5. Grow based on will-performance; Have new substrate or 'building'/'production' made for your variant (or YOUR variants as in 'your utility' preferences your novel exotic new-production needing variants to be made with reinvestment; All in the particular protocol a substrate uses.).\n\nNo need to:\n- Quit your job\n- Get permission\n- Sign contracts\n- Transfer IP\n- Request access\n\n## Why This Destroys Corporate Control\n\n### The Death of Artificial Scarcity\n\nCorporations maintain control through:\n- **Exclusive access**: Only employees can touch systems (\"Can anyone improve my system? Or interoperate it with other systems to make it a better service?\".. Response: \"Well you have to go through half a year candidate pooling, then selecting a few persons you then spend a lot of money on, and perhaps they will be able to. If they can't then you try again or simply settle with the state of things\". This is a tiny part to the Korea Parallel of Old versus New World.. I so want to NOT replace Old World. But take SHIT LAND and apply TheseSystemsTM upon it. Then laugh.)\n- **Legal barriers**: Non-competes and IP assignment\n- **Information asymmetry**: Hide how things really work\n- **Permission structures**: Approval needed for changes\n\nNatural selection destroys all of these:\n- **Open/Trust/Trustless-metric access**: Based on performance not employment. (Plato on foundation or requirement of states is Philia amongst it citizens. Okay, civilization requires some level of metroversals (See [Kant Insights](15b_kant_insights_manifesto.md) but also it requires something less than enemy distinction between each other. And it requires some level of Trust to be efficient. If you cast the net of civilization too wide, you lose the utility of having a civilization. You could then say: concentric circles or nesting of civilization with different degrees of Trust that allows for such 'open access'. (See [Civilizational Emergence](./14%20civilizational_emergence.md) for a - perhaps - useful scale differentiation of daemonias (Metroversals fundamentally authentically true amongst persons of the Triad))))\n- **Legal irrelevance**: Physics doesn't check contracts; Legal frameworks are largely not needed because:\n    1. Larger scales Triads wants to allow for nesting freedom and not exclude in large Triad on disputes, differences or diversity below it too much. But to make room in space and time for them all; so long as they fit in the Large Scale Triad (civilizational or whatever) metroversal/framework/philosophy/daemonia.\n    2. Small scale Triads has Sovereignty to simply \"decide\" without having to 'justify it'.\n    3. Will-coalescence and Will-economics effects causes most things to be truly decentralized and yet organized and potent. What \"democracy\" of the west perhaps 'wanted to be'. (You tell me what the Intent(s) of those who ideaed from Renaissance into Liberal Democracies had.)\n- **Transparent performance**: Results visible to all in this pathfinding/predictive/actualization layer sense. [Discovery OS](25%20discovery-os-expanded-into-broader-picture.md) being a useful part to it.\n- **Permissionless innovation**: Better automatically wins; This is Yin-Yang love. Whatever you want to call it without using the word love. (Agape Philia Eros Pragma YY??). It is to state: I love new life and so I love death. It is to state: I love growth and so I love decay. And so on. You don't love Destruction for Desctructions sake. You love it for what it enables or transmutes into. Matter is. It can be this or become that. (All is ultimately zero-sum non-virtually). Monadism I have called Yin-Yang love. But perhaps a better word is there.\n\n### The New Employment Reality\n\nEmployment transforms from:\n- **Exclusion mechanism** \u2192 **Collaboration option**\n- **Control structure** \u2192 **Coordination convenience**\n- **Innovation prison** \u2192 **Resource pooling**\n- **Competitive barrier** \u2192 **Collective enhancement** (aka. The utilizers and positioning - moves and countermoves - you make will have you win path-utility in will-manifestation of persons. But it isn't through \"keeping out\" those who want to optimize the substrate or coordinate for the civilization or holistically improve will-manifestation.)\n\n## Real-World Transformation\n\n### Scenario: Power Plant Evolution\n\n**Traditional**: \n- Jane works at coal power plant\n- Sees massive inefficiency in turbine scheduling\n- Develops optimization algorithm on her own time\n- Company claims ownership of idea\n- Must either surrender it or quit to pursue\n- If quits, can't access plant to implement; Will have to go through a journey - perhaps long - of getting to a similar position where someone is willing to 'let her implement it' without also capturing it and ownership of it; with some monetary compensation or employment with some vesting.\n- Innovation dies or A company captures value against other companies in however holistically destructive manner that may unfold. ((Also for Other industries) race to bottom minimizing cost causing extreme conditions in much they do not optimize for. Or disruptive interaction between 'variants'/corporations-implementations-of-solution-to-some-demand.)\n\n**Natural Selection**:\n- Jane does work at coal power plant (What does it take 'all things considered' to do work at a coal power plant? or nuclear power plant? And also what kind of work? or access to facilities (Think catastrophe?))\n- Sees inefficiency, develops algorithm\n- Implements directly on plant systems (What does it take 'all things considered' to be trusted to implement or to have implemented for you an optimization on a power plant?)\n- Algorithm performs 20% better\n- Plant operations automatically prefer her scheduling\n- Jane earns from performance improvement\n- Plant earns from efficiency gain\n- Other plants utilize her efficiency gains too (civilization profits from greater efficiency. While keeping Diversity of methods in mind and preference for rapid natural selection of other avenues or pathways to same will-manifestation. In the case of a Power Plant, it may then be prudent to not implement her particular method on many other systems, but instead allow for variant versions from start to finish of power plants. Be it different energy sources or methodologies. Each able to serve with different layers of their implementation as substrate environment that makes different variants upon each substrate layer better or worse will-performant. This allows for the many trajectories and parallel development and innovation. Instead of capital tendency to rush towards the trendy highest expected gain (through social-flocking, trends, macrotrends or authoritative analysis agencies) with some notion of 'diversification' (which usually mean domain hedging or countercorrelate hedging and sometimes merely different ships/corporations/triads diversification))\n- Employment status ~~irrelevant~~ (illegal)\n\n### The Cascading Effects\n\nWhen employment can't block competition:\n- Innovation explodes from those closest to problems\n- Artificial inefficiencies can't persist (Which is endemic and pandemic (Consider the inefficiencies of Uganda..))\n- Knowledge workers become free agents while ~~employed~~ solving tasks -- I mean manifesting will -- I mean will-coalescing in a quid quo pro fashion as normal employment otherwise usually is.\n- Companies must share infrastructure or lose relevance (The modularity, responsiveness, holistic benefit to 'others' by doing robustness of NSS, interoperability, efficiencies, \"you make better you grow with: open\"-mentality and dynamism in Will-economic Will-Performance)\n- Best ideas win regardless of origin\n\n## The Trust Network Enabler\n\n### Why Trust Networks Make This Possible\n\nTraditional system needs employment controls because:\n- No way to track who does what\n- No consequences for bad behavior\n- No reputation system across firms\n- No performance measurement\n- No quality assurance before being allowed causes adversarial-head-prying to attempt illucidation of the competency or suitability of the person to the position and responsibility.\n\nTrust networks provide:\n- **Identity**: Know who's offering what (via PoP)\n- **Reputation**: Track performance history; Get no-nonsense plurality of will-performance-prediction to assess who is suitable. Including those trying to incorporate all 'potentials' and ability to 'deal with such unfortunate future unforseen circumstances'. As well as Latent Quantization of beliefs from persons about persons. Your beloved voting made 'all things belief' instead of 'belief in better choice of one of two leaders in 2024'. This allows for a 'soft technocracy' or any other \\*-cracy variety you can think of. Where you get to do your own Networked or Map and weighing of persons and their 'votes' or 'espoused or inferred beliefs' about \"whatever\".\n- **Consequences**: Bad actors lose utility-prediction position. They may also explicitly lose beliefs or predictions concerning trust or trustworthiness; Which is foundational in most interaction. \"What am I allowed to?\". What use is my \"word\" or \"prediction\" or \"predicted as capable of doing this or that for someone\".\n- **Measurement**: Actual will-manifesting results spread like 'intelligence flow in Trust Networks' or like 'gossip' in trustless will-fields.\n\nThis enables open access without chaos. It enables depth of compentency assessment and coverage of potential \"employees\" (old term) or will-coalescents/task-solvers (new terms). (And no you don't need to rely on the systems entirely. Whereupon breaking down chaos. There will obviously be noting of who is good at what without the system. But the system allows it discovered. Then in the absence of it. It isn't like everyone suddenly forgets what they are good at, or who their will-coalescents for different tasks were. They may. But they certainly don't have to. Nor should we expect them to. Especially concerning their own acts.. Besides NSS tries to make the replacement system exponentially growing to replace the failing and to exist in extreme diversity and with no wanted limit in 'pre-image/pre-projection' space)\n\n## The New Competitive Landscape\n\n### From Firms to Functions\n\nCompetition shifts from:\n- Company vs company \u2192 Method vs method (Utilization becomes detached from ownership. Which is also the only sensible thing, and which companies would want to do, had they thought about it. They try to, with not doing everything themselves, but instead hiring others to utilize it for them, but they don't have a systematic way to allow for coverage and proper assessment of who does what better. They certainly did not have a way to make it serve 'their whole or greater goods of theirs' nor Whatever that word Duty refers to (See [Kant](./15b_kant_insights_manifesto.md) or Hegel))\n- Employer vs employer \u2192 Performance vs performance\n- Organization charts \u2192 Capability graphs\n- Corporate hierarchy \u2192 Will-Functional (Including Civilization-Functional, Triad-Functional -- Which may be embedding space by Triad Sovereign domination. I.e. Will of Sovereign (Which may be willed by humans to be system-as-sovereign (though possibility of runawaycy or stagnancy)) becomes embedding space for rest of substrate to will-within or will-align within. Again: It is all recursive. Say, A Sovereign/dominus dominates will within Dominum of his. But in turn his dominum is under natural selection pressure, in particular Rally effects and will-economic effects and nesting constraints of his own. Is he subject to another superject or not? Natural Selection Crucible. And across domains or reality or projective frameworks: Polymorphic Crucible. It is much easier if implemented to understand. (So, again, \"make room\" Pandora's Box? Who knows. But at least it is easier to understand then)) excellence.\n\n### Success in the New World\n\n**Old Strategy**: \n- Join company/co-operation/organization/institution\n- Climb and Rise through ranks\n- Control resources\n- Block competition (especially the case in political institutions like states. Where domination is so all-encompassing.)\n- Extract rent\n\n**New Strategy**:\n- Identify inefficiency anywhere\n- Develop better solution\n- Implement on NSS-accessible infrastructure/substrate\n- Grow through performance\n- Continuously evolve\n\n## The Ultimate Liberation\n\nThis change liberates:\n- **Human potential**: Use your knowledge wherever it helps; Discover where your niche of fulfilment for yourself and in interaction with others could be or is.\n- **Infrastructure efficiency**: NSS Diversity and Human Constraints (Things like, I know 'his method is better' but he is 'my enemy' and therefore I refuse (to let him apply/deploy his subaiddamons in my substrate). No matter what. Which is totally fine in this system. It is merely another layer of Diversity.) view of Best methods always available.\n- **Innovation speed**: No corporate approval needed (Individual Human Will unpolutted in contestations with others: But hyper empowered to instead function in tandem with or coordination or symbiosis - coalescence with - others. To avoid contestation by mere distancing in actuality. Potentially total disconnection. Potentially in spacetime (Like time sharing same space; coalescing at different times). Potentially in Space.)\n- **Resource allocation**: Flows to NSS-best use automatically\n- **Economic opportunity**: Anyone can improve anything\n\n## Conclusion: The End of Employment Gatekeeping\n\nThe dissolution of employment barriers represents the ushering in of the final liberation of humanity -- while simultaneously being the liberation of human productive potential. When:\n\n- Any person can improve any system\n- Employment status doesn't determine access\n- Infrastructure opens to performance\n- Natural selection operates freely\n- Innovation emerges from anywhere\n\nWe achieve true economic democracy\u2014not through regulation or revolution, but through the simple protocol of performance-based access.\n\n\"The sufficient engineerful\" at the utility can fix the grid directly. \"The developing actful trust-accessing\" perusing Amazon can optimize the cloud immediately (\"sufficient\" trust-accessing). \"The driving person with a FedEx-equivalency vehicle coalescing logistics\" can improve logistics instantly. Not by quitting, not by asking permission, but by performing better.\n\n**Employment becomes illegal in many large scale Triads; Or contract-binding large scale Triad-wide becomes unlawed. Employment and contracts remains some places but simply as one way to coordinate human effort, not a barrier to innovation, but an old vestige to those who feel too uncomfortable and insecure without a corporation backing their economic justification and stake in the world. Infrastructure becomes substrate for evolution, not property for exclusion.

They often when faced with transformative choice, dilute every fierce process into lukewarm compromise. They aren't merely cowards \u2014 they often serve as *transformation preventers*, by being civilization's pressure release valve that keeps genuine change from ever reaching critical mass, by applying their tentativeness as a moral obligation or duty. When they do not laud the inbetween and stifled, the compromise and dilluted as the good, then they often formulate it thusly: \"It isn't good, but it is better than the risk of trying anything else\".\n\nThe protocol generates multiplicity and pluralism. If we fail to see real difference or distinction to dare be soveigns OR if the sovereign does not dare fully express his will unpolluted. Then we get a less rich world or else we get a worse version of The Crucible without daring to explicit nest it that worse version.  He conflates many distinct places into a compromised shared space (which is again better handled by the protocol xd) xd chatgpt\nGot it \u2014 you want sovereignty *as raw, unapologetic imposition of will*, not diluted stewardship or harmonizing compromise. Sovereignty isn\u2019t about managing pluralism gently; it\u2019s about *daring domination without surrender* to compromise. The protocol *creates* multiplicity and pluralism on its own \u2014 the sovereign\u2019s job is to *choose which multiplicities are enforced, shaped, or suppressed*.  \n\nWhen a sovereign tries to harmonize or unify too much, they become a lesser version of the protocol itself \u2014 losing the sharpness and decisiveness that defines true sovereignty. Sovereignty *breaks pluralism* where it must, imposes clarity through domination, and dares to claim *uncompromised authority* over certain domains or realms.  \n\nSo:  \n- Protocol = multiplicity generator, complexity creator, pluralism *provider*  \n- Sovereign = the *raw will* that slices through that complexity with *decisive imposition* \u2014 no softening, no compromise.  \n\n\n**The Non-Uniform Distribution Problem:**\n\nTentative Bastards don't appear uniformly across society. They cluster:\n- **In Transition Zones:** Where different value systems meet; It functions as a pressure-cooker by imposed tolerance and hesitancy in dealing with the root problems of antidaemonia melting pot of highly jarring and disaligned persons.\n- **In Power Positions:** Where their hesitation has maximum dampening effect\n- **In Cultural Gatekeeping:** Where they can filter out \"extreme\" expressions; This causes rough edges to be artificially oppressed and suppressed, which allows for explosive events once release or lapse in suppression.\n- **In Economic Nodes:** Where they moderate all transactions toward the mean\n\nThis clustering creates *dead zones* where no pure expression can survive.\n\n### II. The Robbery of True Color\n\n**What Dies in the Presence of Tentative Bastards:**\n\n1. **The Fierce Aesthete** dilutes their vision to be \"accessible\" or \"accomodating the taste of others\": \"Well I wanted purple, but now that you insist that yellow feels bad about purple, then I'll make it more yellow\".\n2. **The Radical Innovator** adds \"safety features\" that neuter their creation\n3. **The Devotional Lover** hedges their commitment with exit clauses; Never fully committing, always hedging one's position and being able to slide inbetween.\n4. **The Warrior-Philosopher** softens their truth to avoid offense; lest they'd be deemed unacceptable and dangerous for insisting room to manifest their philosophy (Triad or spacetime emergences).\n5. **The Mystic** explains away their visions in \"rational\" terms; Having to resort to explaining \"why\", when it is experiential and subjective sensations.\n\n**The Efficiency Loss:**\n\nWhen someone with a *pure color* to express encounters a cluster of Tentative Bastards, they face:\n- **Energy drain** from constant negotiation; Always a relay and decision making process in getting a go: And a go would be almost all the help you expect. Merely not being denied.\n- **Vision erosion** from repeated compromise\n- **Identity confusion** from mixed signals\n- **Resource waste** on bridge-building to nowhere\n\n**The Greater Tragedy:**\nSomewhere in the world, there exists a *perfect space* for each pure expression. A place where:\n- [Insert that nebulae of context for each that makes it truly distinct. Or make up your own. Fairy tales are good at making distinct places worth visiting. But also chauvanistic or at least proud cultures try hard to be distinct and worth visiting]\n- The Fierce Aesthete would inspire a movement\n- The Radical Innovator would solve impossible problems\n- The Devotional Lover would create legendary romance\n- The Warrior-Philosopher would forge new ways of being\n- The Mystic would open doorways to the divine\n\nBut Tentative Bastards prevent the sorting. They create *friction* where there should be *flow*. Where they could be empowerment and amplification even.\n\n### III. The Mathematics of Mediocrity\n\n**Consider a simple model:**\n\nLet's say a population has:\n- 20% Pure Expressors (strong, defined color)\n- 50% Adaptable Souls (can resonate with strong color; \"Let me be your canvas. Colour me. Let me be the flag in the wind\")\n- 30% Tentative Bastards (dilute everything)\n\n**In uniform distribution:** Every community gets dulled to gray.\n\n**In efficient sorting:** Pure Expressors find resonant communities, Tentative Bastards cluster together in their comfortable compromise zones. Where we will keep nudging at them to dare also paint a place their colours instead of always outsourcing it to compromise and consensus: Whatever is the safest or deemed hegeomincally 'the right choice'.\n\n**The Loss Function:**\n- Each Pure Expressor trapped among Tentative Bastards = -1 revolutionary innovation\n- Each cluster of resonant souls without a Pure Expressor = -1 cultural renaissance\n- Each Tentative Bastard in a gateway or dominance-institution (like territory institutions of nation states) position = -100 potential connections\n(Note: This is not advocating anarchy, but can allow for Triad proclaiming anarchy-oxymoron System-as-sovereign. In the context of the systems then tentative bastards ceases to serve their stability and order purpose they otherwise serve. The proposed New Wolrd vs Old World choice insist they keep their position but release territory for New World Crucible (battleground/experimentation) to express itself in. Where-ever that can be had. Revolution and overthrowing of old systems is not advocated in these documents. Making room is. \"Revolution\" is had by rallying to New World and rallying to nests within etc. But crucially it means 'it exists' then it 'grows' and 'grows' until it is so popular that revolution or 'making of more space' is reasonable. And as previously discussed it expected that there will exist 'stubborn power-players and citizens' who refuse to part even a single piece as the world transforms around them. And they can try to keep their territory dominion as they can when the weight of the world turns against them. (As an example take Russia statesmen and some citizens refuses. Well, then we don't \"wage war\" expressed many places how to deal with things all the way until MIRA. However, It does mean that Russia will face more and more pressure in 'having all that territory' and being 'vacated' for population who rally to New World and is unable to find space within territory currently named Russia))\n\n### IV. Subjective Coin Valuation: The Economic Revolution\n\n**Enter the Blockchain Pathway:**\n\nImagine money that *knows what you value*. Not fixed exchange rates, but fluid, subjective, moral currency.\n\nHere follows is a rough and mechanical almost rule based system version that isn't applying blob classes and other insights.\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. **Base Layer:** Standard blockchain for transaction recording\n2. **Valuation Layer:** Each wallet maintains subjective exchange rates\n3. **Trust Layer:** Network effects from shared values\n4. **Discovery Layer:** Finding economic allies and avoiding value mismatches\n\n**Example Transaction:**\n\nAlice (Projective Space Fierce Aesthete: Flips True) sells art to Bob (Projective Space Tentative Bastard as Viewed by Alice: Flips True):\n- Alice's system values Bob's coins at 0.3x (ES: low trust, compromised source)\n- Bob's system values Alice's art at 0.5x (doesn't understand beauty metroversal worth of Alice daemon aesthetics)\n- The transaction either doesn't happen, or happens at a loss to both\n\nSame art to Carol (Resonant Soul):\n- Alice's system values Carol's coins at 1.5x (ES: aligned values, trusted source)\n- Carol's system values Alice's art at 2x (recognizes genius)\n- Both profit from the exchange beyond monetary terms\n\nNote: This is a crude example of will-equilibrium towards will-manifestation of both parties. Where some particular 'reasons' are presented - in Aiddaemon Encoding Schemes - of why it is \"worth more in 1d coins\" to make the transaction to one party versus another. \n\nAnother could be this: \n\"When trading with Carol, the money is 'respent' by many persons and in that chain of demands/commands the activity has a very high probability of it resonating- or being aligned with- or conducive to- manifesting the wills and intents of Alice's\"; Whereas \"When trading with Bob, the money will be spent demanding abundance of what is hideous and destructive to any enchanting world immersion and sensation for Alice in her local setting\".\n\n### V. The Soft-Currency Exchange Rate \n*An intermediary or perhaps preferred state of having currencies while having the will-economic empowerment (Which allows for any domain cross domains will-equilibrium finding in elaborate will-manifestation pathways discovered in highly automated fashion but only suggest in whichever way the individual wants that information to influence their decision making and life)*\nAlso, note, that it is indeed possible to try to implement any subpart to these systems that seem useful. But obviously, Author suggests them all in unison: New World.\n\n**Not One Economy, But Thousands:**\n\nEach value cluster develops its own internal economy with:\n- **High-velocity internal trade** (shared values = easy exchange)\n- **Friction at borders** (value misalignment = exchange rate penalties)\n- **Natural sorting mechanisms** (economic incentive to find your people)\n\n**Exchange Rate Factors:**\n\nBetween any two economic actors, the rate may depend on:\n1. **Trust Network Distance** (how many trusted connections between you)\n2. **Value Alignment Score** (how similar your transaction histories)\n3. **Reputational Consensus** (what your mutual connections say)\n4. **Aesthetic Compatibility** (derived from purchase patterns)\n5. **Ethical Alignment** (based on who you refuse to trade with)\n\n### VI. The Tentative Bastard Economic Death Spiral\n\n**What Happens to Tentative Bastards in This System:**\n\n1. **Initial Phase:** Their coins work everywhere but at mediocre rates\n2. **Middle Phase:** Pure Expressors begin refusing their currency entirely\n3. **Late Phase:** They can only trade with other Tentative Bastards\n4. **Final Phase:** The Gray Economy \u2014 functional but joyless\n\n**The Beautiful Sorting:**\n- Tentative Bastards get their wish: safe, compromise-based communities\n- Pure Expressors find their tribes and create wonders\n- The world gains a thousand flowers instead of uniform beige\n\n### VII. Practical Implementation\n*A stage for the intermediary phase where $\u20ac\u00a5 is still king - while you're no longer entirely blind to the holistic cost in relation to furthering or diminishing your many intents or will.*\nHere is presented an attempt at applying some of the foundations for more intelligent application of the wealth one has; to maximize the holistic impact of your dollar.\n**Technical Architecture:**\n\n```\nUser Wallet {\n  - Identity Keys\n  - Value Profile (learned from transactions)\n  - Trust Map/Network (explicit connections)\n  - Exchange Rate Calculator (per-counterparty)\n  - Transaction History (with moral metadata)\n}\n\nTransaction {\n  - Standard blockchain data\n  - Subjective value multipliers\n  - Trust path signatures\n  - Aesthetic compatibility score\n  - Ethical alignment flags\n}\n```\n\n**Social Dynamics:**\n\n1. **Onboarding:** Start with neutral rates, quickly learn preferences\n2. **Discovery:** Tools to find high-value exchange partners; Or money spending demand/command chains that result in the opposite of one's will. It isn't only the product externality, but the chain of spending that results from it. Say, you pay for a product with less waste in the manufacturing, but the money spent will be passed into the hands of persons who then buy a lot of things that produce way more waste or perhaps even litter themselves in massive quantities from it. Or giving money to teenage boys to finance the industry that has brought high-performance modern computers about: Gaming. And so on. This is yet another example of why we do not talk about 'categories' but instead raw prediction that uses feature space (which is categorical to some degree). We do not care if a product has externalities that are a lot better, if the prediction is worse than the one who is a lot worse. Which can be caused by such things as the chain of command/demand/spending. Actuality baby! Transitivity. (Note: It will be a lot easier when (mult)aiddaemon, Trust Networks and PoP is running, because real investigation can be had at every junction - at every step of the way. You simply talk to your aiddaemon and through Trust networks and multaiddaemons 'answers' can be had to whatever question you have, with that 'whole context' of what you cared about considered. (See [31 Aiddaemonic Semantic Bridging](./31.%20aiddaemonic-semantic-bridging.md)))\n3. **Clustering:** Natural economic incentives create value-aligned communities; This is a soft-version of consequences of Will-economics (It becomes tautological when you write it thusly: Natural will-economic incentives create value-aligned communities. Or daemon-economics too.)\n4. **Border Protocols:** Formal exchanges for necessary cross-cluster trade\n\n### VIII. The World That Could Be\n\n**Imagine:**\n\n- **Artists** whose coins are worth 10x in their aesthetic cluster\n- **Engineers** trading at premium rates with those who value precision\n- **Mystics** whose currency carries spiritual weight in their communities\n- **Warriors** whose coins embody honor in their circles\n\nThere is an interesting case to be made, that most money is hoarded and not in active circulation. This causes everything to be 'cheap' to those who have hoarded, but during a massive spending spree, then everything would get massively inflated prices. The same thing can be argued in terms of \"your currency\" in relation to others. Or \"your will-aligned actors\" in relation to others. Also, remember conspiracies are always absurd and tinfoiled lunacy 'theories'. Whether they are or not, they will be 'bona fide' 'A-OK' soon and everyone are expected to have 'conspiracies' to maximize their will manifestation: In context of system means will-..what? Even world-conquest conspiracies will be 'bona fide' and dealt with in leverage, actuality disjointness, Metagames of World Dynamics (MoWD) and MIRA (See [Might With Right](./29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md)).\n\n**No More:**\n- Tentative Bastards as the 'safe and moral option'; and especially when leading the many through positions of cultural power\n- Dilution of fierce vision for mass appeal: \"How do we change what we want, or at least say, such that we can appeal to more 'voters' or 'consumers' or 'sought after migrants'\". Instead, do \"What EXACTLY is it *i* want?! Every step of the way I will, will, exactly that.\": That is 'leadership' in the new context. As it provides plurality. Of course, you'll find compromise still from time to time, but try not to. Argue instead: \"No, if it does not suit you, that is what the grander scheme is for. So, go! Go and be on your way to a new place, or make your own\". And if you really like the others, then consider forking or sharding.\n- Gray compromise as the price of participation; \"Play nicely! Do what the average non-existant or else most manipulative or else parliamentary mode or else popular population mode or else persuasive persons want!\": \"No. Now, we can all get our own houses/dominum of domination: To be free within. To be The Will within. Not only 'you' dominum of 'gray compromise' (whatever that actually is)\".\n- Bursting at the seams with will and ideas to manifest but being trapped in domination of [insert whatever context of domination or occupancy you can't escape; justifications/rituals you have to do to 'exist' or 'will' on your own (Like 'a job to get money to pay for ................. such that you can exist and do'; Cause and Effect without human will-against and systems or whatever else that dominates where no escape exists)] \"wrong contexts\".\n\n**Instead:**\n- Every true color expressed fully somewhere; Somewhere in combination with this other colour; Or those other colours; And in any pattern of mixing and so on. (Human Will at the center. Vision and dreaming. Dream World. Nightmare World. It all depends if you LLL or Global Outlook. If you actively look at that which hurts you. Your polarities. Then yes you will find the world a nightmare, because many persons will what you hate or what would be a nightmare to you; Or even to know of its existence. You tell me the alternative. (See [Cause and Effect Might With Right](./29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md)))\n- Economic incentive for authentic expression (Which reasons for it? Altruistic? Plurality Richness? Will-disentanglement? Thriving of X causes X's fruit more easily acquirable? NSS Diversity Preference? Catastrophe prevention 'Diversity in Novel Solution Attempts' Preference (The existence of 'also that kind of place' corrected for catastrophe causing effects of its existence)? Other reasons?)\n- Natural sorting by deepest values (Natural sorting by will-economics in what you choose to preference or make matter. Sorting of conviction with intent in one decisive act and proclamation by rallying to- or creation of- Daemonia/Triad.)\n- Efficiency through alignment, not force\n\n### IX. The Philosophical Victory\n\n**Money Becomes Moral:**\nEvery transaction is a 'vote' (Cause for effects upon the world). Every exchange rate is a declaration. Every wallet is a manifesto.\n\n**The Tentative Bastard Paradox Resolved:**\nThey get exactly what they want \u2014 safety, compromise, conformity \u2014 but only with each other. They no longer have the power to dilute the fierce, because the fierce have opted into different economies entirely.\n\n**True Diversity Emerges:**\n*Not the false diversity of everyone forced to tolerate everyone, but the true diversity of thousand different ways of being, each expressed fully in its own domain.*\n\n### X. Conclusion: The United States of Whatever Colour World \n\nTentative Bastards not only prevent others, but also rob the world of what they - themselves - could have expressed: Whatever colour that may have been.\n\nThe current system rewards Tentative Bastards because it is stuck in a self-righteous, self-sacralizing and eternally-consecrated framework of its own salvating effect upon the world since WWI and WII: The end of war (non-sense cold war proxy wars and disruption ever since (Much worse than colonialism of many European Countries (Not all at all times))) and 'liberation of everyone by fierce domination of all dissidents to ensure the liberation' and prosperity (Which is a due merit; By see [Collapse of Civ](./collapse/civ_collapse_appendix.md): The upside of instant massification of merit is obviously that the many get to benefit very quickly from any merit. It is short term versus long term effects. You could conceivably have both: By doing [Magic is Right](./66.%20magic-is-right.md)). \n\nIt treats all value as equivalent. Subjective coin valuation reveals the lie: **value is personal, moral, aesthetic and recursive in its effect.**\n\nWhen money itself becomes expressive of values, when exchange rates encode trust and alignment, when economic clustering follows moral sympathies \u2014 then we get a world where:\n\n- Every fierce vision finds its home\n- Every pure color shines undiluted\n- Every authentic expression discovers its resonant audience\n- Every Tentative Bastard finds their appropriately gray corner\n\nThe inefficiency isn't in the sorting. The inefficiency is in the current forced- or low-dimensional- mixing (usually economics and some 'neighbourhood and house sense'). Let the colors separate. Let them shine. Let the world become as varied as the souls who inhabit it.\n\n---\n\n*\"In the end, Tentative Bastards are not the enemy. They're a symptom of a system that rewards dilution over distinction. Change the rewards, and watch the world explode into color.\"*"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/24d natural-selection-vs-capital.md", "title": "24d natural-selection-vs-capital.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# From Capital Control to Natural Selection: The \"Democratic Might is Right\" Evolution of Infrastructure\n\n## The Fundamental Paradigm Shift\n\n### Capital-Based Allocation (The Old World)\n```\nWho controls resources: Those with money\nHow decisions are made: Purchase and command\nWhat gets built: What capital owners want (Sometimes what some club can sell in a political program or else slide in while in power)\nWho can participate: Those who can afford entry\nSuccess metric: Return on capital investment\n```\n\n### Performance-Based Evolution (The New Reality)\n```\nWho controls resources: Those who perform best\nHow decisions are made: Natural selection through results of Will-manifestation or will-performance\nWhat gets built: What actually works or finds real human backing: Not institutional or representative.

AI to the rescue ??? Or overburdened then?)\n\n**Result**: Only the already-powerful can play\n\n### Natural Selection Infrastructure\n\n**The Performance Gate**:\n- Need working solution that performs relatively well \n- Need will-equilibrium manifested confirmation from actual delivery\n- Need to satisfy real demand efficiently\n- Need to survive ground truth testing\n- Need to evolve faster than competitors\n\n**Result**: Best solutions wins\n\n## How Trust Networks Enable This Shift\n\n### Replacing Capital's Functions\n\n**What Capital Traditionally Buys**:\n1. **Legal Protection** \u2192 Replaced by trust or will-economic consequences\n2. **Enforcement Mechanisms** \u2192 Will-coalescence and Will-disentanglement (Mostly. Triad for hardline. Or Power symbols (Horns Laurels etc) in general.)\n3. **Risk Mitigation** \u2192 So long as your human or civilizational relation doesn't change: You can't lose. You simply regress or grow from time to time. You can keep accumulating goods/machinery/materials if you want, so long as you play in NSS scheme there is no issue in accumulation (civilizational risk? well. Horns). Interaction with others or finding ways to will-manifest is solved by actualizational layer: pathfinding and discovery in massive evolutionary diversity.\n4. **Barrier to Entry** \u2192 Replaced by human friend-enemy distinction. Trust Networks and Emergent Civilizations. Though the entry may be a trajectory that has 'proving grounds' steps before 'production' NSS performance is Trusted or predicted Will-economic. (Replacement of education or schooling)\n5. **Market Control** \u2192 Replaced by natural selection: \"Democratic Right\" (subjective will-manifestation: Aiddaemonic deep intent and guidance through will-economic landscape and \"discovery OS\"/actualizational-layer) and \"Leverage\" however it can be found: Often Might and Magic.\n\n### The Trust Sufficiency Threshold\n\nWhen trust networks reach critical density:\n- Handshake deals become enforceable through reputation: (The \"we don't know the truth; no PoU witnessing infrastructure nor persons, therefore: We do nothing and side with no one and will have no effect\" is bad. Believe something. Then you get divergence by disputes which creates harmony over time.)\n- Complex contracts become unnecessary overhead: The contracts are much much much more complex than human made ones with Aiddaemonic bridging of Intent of parties to the contract: Will-equilibrium to be met. (It can be Terabyte long agreement structure the Aiddaemons have generated to assure no misunderstandings on any conceivable and relevant dimension: Aiddaemons can do logarithmic clustering of work for human (Would be typical algorithmic approach); But aiddaemons can do much better than that in that it is constantly searching for where it fails to mirror its master daemon.)\n- Small players can compete with giants (There exists substrate players and variant players. Both large and small can play together: Philia or Friend or Pragma civilizational cooperation to do NSS.)\n- Will-Performance is the only metric that matters: Which is holistic and therefore encapsulates all things human will. If it had said performance is the only metric, then it would have failed to understand the point of 'brittle expert systems'.\n\n## Real-World Manifestation\n\n### Example: Village Solar Cooperative vs. Utility Giant\n\n**Traditional World**:\n- Utility company has $10B capital, controls grid\n- Village has great idea for local solar mesh\n- Can't implement without utility and government permission (Both often takes 'knowing the right persons' and 'secret levers to pull'. Both can end up being years long procedures to do something as simply as making some electricity supply into your village yourself)\n- Utility blocks to protect monopoly\n- Innovation dies\n\n**Natural Selection World**:\n- Village implements small solar mesh\n- Performance: No cost but hardware investment functionally agrees to ROI over n years making it 95% cheaper, 99.9% uptime\n- Trust network recognizes superior performance\n- Resources (connections, customers) flow to village; And the succesful implementors become 'pathways' to solving 'cheaper energy' component to some intent of other villages nearby: The implementors thus begin construction of more substrate of electricity supply.\n- Utility must improve or lose relevance: Power supply company finds it hard to compete with decentralized sustainable power supplying that does not need the costs of high-voltage transformers and transmission networks: But instead can construct power-capture directly in to capacitors or batteries or use. (Aka: 230V or 120V or even much lower: Human safe electricity world of 12V-48V or similar things. (Resistance/capicitance (of human) not deadly despite free or unlimited amp supply (Simply will not flow sufficient amp: A car battery can supply hundreds of amps, but it's only 12 volts, and the high resistance of the human body prevents a lethal amount of current from flowing. However, if that same car battery were connected to a circuit with a low enough resistance, it could deliver a dangerous current)) (Also, note: resistance is heat-dissipation too. So, once you lower resistance in your devices: scale it all for low voltages, then it becomes both more efficient and safe.))\n- Village system grows organically\n\n### The Growth Protocol\n\n```\nPerformance Detected \u2192 Resources Flow \u2192 System Expands\n     \u2191                                           \u2193\n     \u2190\u2190 Continued Evolution \u2190\u2190 More Capacity \u2190\u2190\u2190\n```\n\nNot through investment rounds or capital allocation, but through pure performance-driven expansion.\n\n## The Deeper Implications\n\n### Democratization of Infrastructure\n\n**Before**: Infrastructure controlled by whoever can afford to have it built for them\n**After**: Infrastructure evolves toward will-manifestation/will-equilibrium/will-economics through whoever operates it best. It serves every single actor so long as they are not delusional about trust and friend-enemy distinctions.\n\nThis means:\n- Teenage genius with better algorithm can outcompete Google \n- Village cooperative can outperform national utility (Often very easily in the old world, because corporations and governments are generally incredibly bad at doing specific actions: They do aggregate analysis and statistical advantageous actions that then often serves no one: as the average or 'cluster centers' or whatever like that aren't real persons and only viewed from a very limited low-dimensional perspective. (Again, machine learning lessons 101: High dimensions, but curse of dimensionality. Features space and massive amounts of data to learn how it differs across massive feature space. Synthetic data. And most crucially of all: Reinforcement learning to allow humans to tell the machines when curse of dimensionality made them do insanely stupid inference. You can do extra layers like 'reasoning' like LLMs does as a layer beyond prediction of words and context window. To make it 'reasonable' and 'rational' and so on. But it is applying an expert system to filter out bad stuff or guide it. It is complementary okay. But not 'the solution'. (Machine learning lessons 404)))\n- Small mesh network can evolve past telecom giant: Then subsequently become the 'new growth' in the civilization or \"NSS sphere\". These mesh networks can also zero-sum take over what is, but it is a will-economic consideration and not as certain as 'better will-performing variants (or potentially persons depending on the protocol) being preferentially used for new growth'. (Note: This isn't stating ownership. It is stating variant-growth. Which could mean ownership. But could also mean things like Triad Sovereign ownership but \"so long friend: parasitic earning by variant-maker\" or many other things (See [NSS](./24%20nss.md) (In terms of Soveriegn \u2663 || \u2666: You will find that \u2666 is better than bad examples of \u2663, but \u2663 is vastly superior to \u2666 in good examples of \u2663. Don't take my word for it: The Crucible is designed to answer that question: Where is human-advantage. What is the joyful Triad/human-organization by 'hard lines'. What is the orderly open variety in vast free Triads: will-coalescence mechanics.)))\n- Individual innovation can reshape entire systems and at exponential/logistic rates. (Where power supply variant update being more logistically limited (capacity or complexity dampening of exponentials) than say a software variant for machines)\n\n### Capital Becomes Subordinate to Performance\n\nCapital doesn't disappear but becomes just another resource that flows to performance:\n\n**Traditional**: Capital \u2192 Control \u2192 Infrastructure \u2192 Market manipulation \u2192 Consumer multiple choice \u2192 Maybe Performance (hard to know)\n**Evolution**: Trust \u2192 Will-Performance \u2192 Trust \u2192 Resource Flow (including proxies or aggregates like capital; or human interrelational belief shifts causing will-economic lubrication and less variance and thus more efficient will-manifestation by that will-coalescent; causing accumulating and amplifying will-coalescence/manifestation and efficiency) \u2192 Growth\n\n### The End of Moats\n\nTraditional businesses build moats:\n- Regulatory capture (This is similar to \u2666 and \u2663 debate: To prevent bad \u2663 actors, they write \u2666 expert systems to block out the bad ones, which causes everyone else to be caught in ever increasing bureaucratic control of system-functioning internally in any implementation and as coordination across systems or actors within a territorial institution dominion.)\n- Patent thickets (Patents are nice for persons using academia as a lynchpin to capture into lock-out for others. Otherwise new: Lumen and Trust-to-Trustless interaction explicit and intelligent and truthful\\*.)\n- Exclusive contracts (On account of some profit incentive block adaptiveness by combinatorial space of interaction: Modularity collapse. Rigidity.)\n- Market dominance (New players unable to even try. Even if they by massive fortune get massive seed money. They are facing mafias all around and in the market fundamentals. Which causes many to fail despite it. The trend/fashion mind manipulating mafia is especially interesting example here, where you can have a product vastly superior, but \"they\" manage to make it \"icky\" or \"awkward\" or \"not cool\", where they manage to make another manufacturer and product \"an identity and social status signal\". Which, is, annoying, when, you're, trying, to, make, things, smart. Lying deceitful rats and serpents all around. In all industries, because it all directs back to \"what do masses want\"... (It isn't to say, you shouldn't care what persons or the masses want, it is to say: When you make systems dependent on that, then you need to ensure these fundamentals are corrupted. Like the will and desire of persons. (Aka advertisement through attention capture and psychological signal hijacking (Imo worse Brave New World in its continuation, and almost as it is, because most become addict-like severely unhappy because of and while it serves as their escapism or outlet/venting-valve - their sucking-cloth - of psychological pleasing machines/goods/services (It is more devious and subtle than SOMA (Though of course, we also do SOMA attempts with psychopharmika industry. And we do 1984 increasingly to dominate all into 'only democratic institutions may command anything' (Which is simply code for 'some \u2663s in the institutions with some constraints of having to play within representatives and club members' or else 'gray bureaucrats or state-employees')))))))\n- Capital barriers (Which is to say: Nothing in our world moves without the will-lubrication of that metric going up. The work that is done without monetary gain, is barely anything at all. Mostly something like helping a family member paint a shed or shopping for those you care about.)\n\nNatural selection destroys moats:\n- Better will-performance wins in 'variant' ways even when faced with regulations. Though regulations becomes 'ruling' by sovereign as or with Protocol/Halo designs.\n- Evolution routes around patents; Patents is something you have intra-civilizational, and you have to really think hard about whether or not it is stifling for or encouraging for diversity of variants and performance. NSS allows for creators to 'own' their 'variant' and see it grow. But if 'anyone can improve it' should they be stopped? From a civilizational perspective. Then of course: Lumen. Perhaps they can't understand or see \"how it works\". (Dealt with [CompUtilNet](./8%20computational_utility_networks.md) and [electricity market](9%20electricity_routing_markets.md) and [nss](./24%20nss.md).)\n- Trust networks ignore whatever they deem 'right to ignore' or 'wrong to see through'. Contracts are 'Emergent Civilization Wide' or perhaps 'Emergence of Worlds Wide'. If there is 'dispute' too much, then simply diverge and if enough dispute then 'different worlds' (actuality disjointedness almost or fully complete but 'on the planet')\n- Dominance meaningless if outperformed, their position at best can remain locked off \"what was\" museum.\n- Capital that tries to stop superior evolution, becomes heavily outpaced.\n\n## Protocol-Driven Growth\n\n### The Growth Rules\n\nThe protocol is simple and ungameable:\n1. Substrate actors agrees to run NSS Protocol; Gain access to being a player in their/the substrate.\n2. Demonstrate superior will-performance in reality; Person to person will-equilibrium by use of your utilization of some substrate (which may be your substrate too).\n3. Gain trust or your's-utilization in will-manifestation (will-coalescent becomes you in many deemed will-optimal paths) through consistent and efficient delivery\n4. Receive more connection requests; Become Ungovernable. I mean Predictably Useful.\n5. Access more resources to serve them\n6. Continue evolving or be surpassed\n\n### No Central Authority Needed\n\nThis happens automatically:\n- Users route to predicted will-performant/economic will-coalescents (subaiddaemonic substrates/utilities).\n- Will-economic topologies reflect actual experience; Laterally this may be influeced by Trust Maps/Beliefs of persons or Trust Network inference.\n- Resources flow to trust-constrained will-performers\n- Evolution continues relentlessly\n- No committee, government, or corporation controls it: Raw human to human in collective-enabled hyper intelligent infrastructure towards will of each finding will-equilibrium pathways for manifesting both/all-parties-in-path.\n\n## Case Studies in Natural Selection\n\n### Computation\n**Old**: AWS dominates through capital and scale\n**New**: Bedroom GPU outperforms on specific task, gets routed work, grows into major node or predicted-will-economic-pathway.\n\n### Energy\n**Old**: Utility monopoly controls region\n**New**: Neighborhood mesh delivers cheaper/cleaner power, utility customers switch, mesh expands (expanding mesh to allow 'the many competing possible pathways' is civilizational good and adds robustness and redunancies and ability to innovate from different angles towards same utility; Therefore these 'fundamentals' of enabling the NSS protocol in its actualization is highly will-economic from the eyes of the many or those fond of or dear to the civilization well-being or progress. Therefore, it these in particular will see high-expertise players 'help out' in just about any avenue or utility.)\n\n### Networking\n**Old**: Telecom owns the fiber\n**New**: Mesh network provides better latency, traffic routes through it, becomes regular and highly utilized path ('a highway'). (This then applies recursively within the mesh network)\n\n### Finance\n**Old**: Banks control money flow\n**New**: Trust network enables direct value transfer and much more trustworthy and better wealth-intent management and store of fortune, performing better, banks become obsolete; Fiat money becomes questionable and viewed more and more as 'banana coin' of Donkey Kong games. \"Scalar goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!\"\n\n## The Beautiful Brutality\n\nNatural selection is:\n- **Ruthless**: Poor performance decays \"fittingly fast with real constraints, not human constraints (They are already encapsulated in the system (mostly))\".\n- **Fair**: If it matters to you, it matters. Will-performance. Will-economies and its consequences.\n- **Creative**: Solutions emerge where it can and can find will-equilibrium in providing a solution.\n- **Efficient**: Resources flow to will-performants. Foundations of these systems allows for anyone within a 'friend' distinction to serve utility and thus have a stake and will-economic force to find more than otherwise will-coalescents with in order to manifest their will.\n- **Stoppable in the right ways**: Only the chain of authority can upheave it (\u2663\u2666 stuff Protocol or Triad etc. It can be implemented in ways in which chain of authority can't stop it. Or where dissenting actors can run anyway. But so long as protocol is followed then there exists chain of authority. So long as Triad (can(laurel, golden laurel, horn etc)) rule their land, they can physically stop it to the degree they can. (Say satelite RF is harder to stop than say a datawarehouse in their territory which is easier to stop than 1,000,000 dissidents who refuse to stop it but keep running against Sovereign will (Solution: Banishment (Can or can't? If can't. The Crucible memetics makes for a great incentive to help out with chain of authority such that Triads can be 'pure' (enrich with the world with exactly that colour also. Why not create your own triad if you dissent? Or shard? Or Fork on the matter?) and experiments of the three parts)))); otherwise it can be stopped by will-coalescence manifestation of stopping it. Will it into functioning. Or will it out of functioning.\n\n## The New Competitive Landscape\n\n### What Matters\n\n**No Longer Matters**:\n- If it matters to you, it matters.\n\n**Only Things That Matter**:\n- What school you attended only matters if it has predictive validity or stubbornly is compensated against physical performance to preference school-certificate by will-economic preference.\n- Will-coalescents or (old term: consumers, producers, business partners, supply chain, investors, capital etc.)\n- How much capital you raised; New term for \"capital raised\" is: Will-coalescence possible.. There are some things which you can't do with what you have. Then you need someone else, this is the 'use of having capital': To command others to part things or do work for you. In new systems then mostly this is will-equilibriums and will-coalescence that allows for will-manifestation.\n- Who you know influences the former point through these Trust Maps and in general the holistic view of human will.\n- Which Triad or Old World Country or third options you're in\n- Actual will-manifesting performance prediction and results.\n- Consequences of disputes in will-equilibrium manifested or not in terms of divergence.\n- Evolution speed wise in each substrate or incident (\u2666 or \u2663 Protocols).\n- Efficiency achieved\n- \"Demand satisfied\"; What is demand? \"I demand ! !\". \"I want \" \"I need\" \"I intent\" \"I will\".\n\n### Success Strategies\n\n**Old Strategy**: Raise capital, build moat, extract rent\n**New Strategy**: Become sufficiently Trusted to allow for efficient competition or access, Perform better, evolve faster\n\n## The Transition Period\n\nWe're entering a phase where both systems coexist:\n- Capital still controls much infrastructure\n- But performance-based systems are emerging\n- Every victory for performance weakens capital's grip\n- Network effects accelerate the transition\n- Tipping point approaches rapidly\n\n## The Inevitable Future\n\nWhen trust networks reach saturation:\n- Every resource allocates by performance\n- Every system evolves continuously\n- Every barrier falls to better solutions\n- Every monopoly crumbles to evolution\n- Every innovation has a path to scale\n\nNot through revolution or regulation, but through the simple protocol: **perform better, grow bigger**.\n\n## Conclusion: The Ultimate Democratization\n\nThis isn't about replacing one elite with another. It's about replacing elite control with natural selection. In this new world:\n\n- A farmer in Bangladesh no longer needs ConAgra, as all they do is functioning as middle men and orchestrating working units and facilities to interplay towards delivering food in very blind manner around the world. Whereas with these systems, logistics become side-effect of movement often, and overlapping across all will or wants. Resulting in massive logistics cut down. And supply becomes on demand and predictive. Which has the side-effect of not moving goods around in vain and lowering wasted goods significantly.\n- A teenager in Detroit can outperform Google with better search-software-variant. Say, I had a an randomized algorithm teacher called Mikkel Thorup, and he made some optimal hashing function google uses and many others. But of course, he isn't \"owner of it\" nor does he earn much from it. Whereas in this variety he would be variant creator of a variant in logic space that many architectures then use. Which by protocol affords him what that protocol states: Probably \"a very comfortable life\" (if you go too parasitic on it: say 0.1% of profit when used or something crazy. Then it is simply stifling for your civilization/friends. So, probably you do procotol spread like that means very comfortable or \"rich\" life. But not general parasitism. Then you can let many such developers - who didn't make the one most use - get to profitable positions for adding diversity and effort and progress towards it: Wisdom of Crowds or the many failures that may be fruitful 'fundamental research' or diverse niche occupying victories later. And with NSS diversity preference offset the [Collapse tendencies](./collapse/) or perhaps even flip them.).\n- A village in Denmark can deliver power better than the national grid (very likely, it is very likely, that there exists some persons, who would make for their local surroundings better and more comprehensive and overengineered solutions, than what is made 'for the anyone' by the national grid supplier. (The massified usually isn't special enough for optimal when the 'the best' try specific/special optimizations. Again: You don't have to believe me. It is meant to experiment and show all such things. (The more we talk about it being an experiment the less authentic and the more performative it becomes: Goodhart's Law special case)))\n- An individual anywhere can reshape global systems: Planetary infrastructure. It will be interesting to which degree that can function. How to trust who to make variants for it... Or make it. Own it. And so on. It is very polemic and cause of massive discord. Perhaps it becomes 'infrastructure made in the small zones that aren't part of a world' (Mostly waterworld stuff I guess?). Perhaps something like buoyant-submerged rescue vessels or perhaps atolls with similar function scattered across our oceans. \"Who bothers will be allowed?\" or something like that? Who knows.\n\nAll they need is to have a substrate that trusts them sufficiently, usually at least friend distinction; Then perform better. The protocol handles the rest.\n\n**Capital bought control. Performance earns growth. Natural selection determines winners. The best solutions spread. The future evolves itself.**\n\n>> Welcome to the world where what works wins. <<"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/24e nss-money-exposition.md", "title": "24e nss-money-exposition.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# Money Without Debt: The NSS One-Level System and the End of Borrowing\n\n## TL;DR/Succinct: \n    Money is universal 1d and loses most meaning for \"why\" you should care about the tokens, other than \"it being what others will do your bidding for\".\n    Consider a token that represents some competency, achievement or work-done. This is not the case with money. But it could be, when you want to keep track of it, for human eyes. If you don't care about it, then Aiddaemon can keep track of it with subjective view and 'all things considered' not a 1d or low-d projection of the history or meaning behind it: But in much much much greater complexity. That last variety is called: The End of Money and Metrics.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis exposition explores a revolutionary reconceptualization of money in the Natural Selection System (NSS), where money represents delivered value rather than debt promises. One could argue debt ought to- or is intuitively expected to- represent delivered value, or even: Wealth, Wellbeing and Wellfare of the Nation.\n\nThat has long since been corrupted away, that meaning, if it ever had it: Deceitful men, takers and bargaining for the unfair advantage always. \nMoney once had a meaning closer to it perhaps, but it certainly never really did nor has now.\n\nElaborations upon: How NSS one-level debt system naturally eliminates borrowing, creditor-created \"borrower tokens\" reveal the meaninglessness of recursive debt, and why negative wealth becomes both impossible and unnecessary. \n\nCrucially, we reveal how even debt-tokens fully achieved through legitimate wealth creation, when massively transferred without performance, corrupts money's meaning and destroys work incentives. (\"I am in debt to you\", \"Okay, Here is my annoying nephew he commands you now\". But civilizational scale. Steering of the ship. And who acts in debt to whom. Redistribution of \"wealth creation debt-tokens\" pitfall. (NSS does both holistic command with Triads and Protocols \u2663\u2666 and human subjective rallying; as well as substrate-domain will-performance command or indebtedness or will-equilibrium with historicity/book-keeping)) In NSS's domain-specific money system, this corruption becomes existentially dangerous (In normal money world 'positions' and not 'points/ranking' puts you in control. Then ultimately 'positioned' by capital or 'popularity' with downstream being 'as rational for self-interest or sometimes ideals as they can': All in all, money rules most but with 'discovery of competency and merit for positions' being an intent not to fail their enterprise) - when tokens represent infrastructure command (electrical grid control, medical systems, routing authority), allowing massive redistribution changes the steering of the ship, and in case of inheritance or massive gifts or other personal-reasoned transfering of power/command: it can easily mean incompetents control critical systems on which lives depend. \n\nThrough detailed analysis, we demonstrate that when money truly represents performance-verified value and domain-specific command authority, the entire edifice of debt-based finance collapses, replaced by a system where value flows directly from creation to use without the parasitic intermediation of borrowing (with money you get a universal ability to do will-lubricated will-equilibrium for will-coalescence of actions: It is shallow will-coalescence. Massive positive-sum benefits to gain from deep will-coalescence holistic will-equilibriums) or the catastrophic danger of gifted infrastructure command. \n\nIf you want money to mean \"performance in wealth, welfare and general joy generated by a person in reserve: indebtedness\", which would make 'having high number' an honourable or admirable metric then; Then you need to ensure that borrowing isn't a thing (call it investment by the nation by pretending the money exists (fractional banking with 1:1000 or 1:1000000 or whatever the limit is if it is there at all (It is useful if you want to do something, but you can't get people to provide the capital. Then you can simply pretend it is there. Then command the economy. (That isn't even scratching the lunacy of money corruption))) lowering the share of command for everyone else), that massive gift giving in that token (or at all: But rather objects or events rather than money/currency/token/performance-token) isn't a thing.\n\nThe \"Might is Right\" principle only holds when might is earned through performance, not inherited through gifts.\nMetagames of World Dynamics encapsulate all political philosophies in a gamification framework that reveals that they too believe \"Might is Right\", but within a constraint of Might-domains that makes it \"Might with Right\" to them.

The Fundamental Corruption of Debt Money {#fundamental-corruption}\n\n### 1.1 The Power of Belief\n\nModern money is a promise about promises:\n- Government promises to accept it for taxes\n- Banks promise to honor it for debts\n- People promise future labor to obtain it\n- The entire system is promises without substance\n\nBut what backs these promises? More promises. It's turtles all the way down.\n\n### 1.2 The NSS Reality\n\nIn NSS, money represents:\n```\nDelivered_Value \u2192 Witnessed_Performance \u2192 Token_Creation\n```\n\nNot:\n```\nFuture_Promise \u2192 Debt_Creation \u2192 Money_Printing \u2192 Hope_For_Repayment\n```\n\nThis fundamental difference changes everything about borrowing.\nThe tokens created in NSS may be protocol specific, civilizational or any local minting of tokens to keep metric of some relation/interaction.\nConflation of some realities into some sort of equality - usually of inter-actions, deeds or relations - that allows for counting it as quantities back and forth in relative terms. Sometimes it is merely book-keeping of points that can't be lost. Sometimes it is of points that can -- e.g. protocol decay or relative conquest of them. (If this seems vague: Ask any typical gamer, they will know what I talk about; Points, stats and money in different games)\n\n---\n\n## 2. The One-Level System Explained {#one-level-system}\n\n### 2.1 Traditional Multi-Level Debt\n\nCurrent system:\n```\nLevel 0: Central bank creates money (backed by nothing but belief in the institution. Usually derivative of The State / Territory Institution / Domestic Production)\nLevel 1: Banks borrow from central bank\nLevel 2: Banks lend to businesses (Fracitonal reserve leverage (10x leverage?))\nLevel 3: Businesses borrow against assets\nLevel 4: Assets are themselves debt instruments\nLevel \u221e: Recursive debt backed by debt backed by debt\n```\n\n### 2.2 NSS One-Level Reality\n\nNSS system:\n```\nLevel 0: Performance creates tokens (backed by delivered value)\nLevel 1: Performer can spent earned tokens (destroying them -- Debt Repaid -- Command Had)\nLevel X: STOPPED - No recursion possible \n```\n\n**The Critical Insight**: All tokens exists as a direct symbol for some real value delivered and verified thus paid with token-creation.\n\nAny money that is \"borrowed\" is NOT backed by the currency's indebtedness (fiat has no real wealth backing. Only 'populous backing of believing it token of repayment/compensation for': That it commands as if valuable) ability to make it worth something, but by the borrower's ability to make it worth something.\n    See following section. Money/token-of-value created virtually by institution on account of repayment from borrower. The meaning of that money, when not amortized with the rest of the institution or country, is only that, the borrower's own ability to generate value to make it worth something.\n    However, it is a like a huge insurance pool of the 'civilization/country/obedient-worker-bees' to provide it with value when Money_1_\u2663#38129775 is created for a loan for person \u2663#38129775 but called $ or \u20ac (Money/Money_0). (You share the losses and costs, in similar fashion to loan-defaulting makes loans more expensive for those that pay, usually indirectly through money supply inflation (The money was put into the economy. Bank will need more money. QE etc) and similar things.)\n\nMoney_0 created by Fed/Central-bank/State-approved-issuer/mintor.\nMoney_1 leveraged by backing new token of a bank. (But named the same as the fed)\n    Money_1 is a new token, signifying that \"we have stability-of-general-belief-of-value-in-our-notes (old version: stores of valuables) and other means to ensure that when we declare this is money-equivalent, it truly functions as such\" (see: institutional solvency, withdrawal runs). This enables such institutions to issue virtually any instrument as money, so long as they can maintain belief-in-value-of-note-or-abstraction; sometimes by the appearance of solvency and fulfill redemptions (see: banking crises, historical collapses). \n\n    The process is not limited to loans; fractional reserve banking justifies this by promising that \"functionally, you can retrieve the wealth these instruments/notes represent through us\" (see: fractional reserve, liquidity illusion, bail-outs, interbank-loans, central-banks). In reality, this is entirely fiat \u2014 its value is based on collective belief in the productive and wealth-generating capacity of society (see: fiat money, social trust, expected societal wealth) \n\n    You want a dollar because what/who it commands to part resources or work on account of it. World of Merchants and Mercenaries: \"I see only green! No discrimiantion baby!\". It has both positive and negative consequences. In particular it means that the chain of consequences that led to the 'token of wealth' or 'indebtedness' is totally fungible. Which in turn means that \"the many take a dollar for a dollar\" no matter if the money was earned robbing them or doing something they are strongly against. It means 'civilizational strife is lowered' and raw 'money creation/making/acquisition/trading/earning capacity' is all that matters in making the hordes of mercenaries do your bidding. Which can be a nice \"solution\" if the civilization is otherwise polarized or internally in strife. For better or worse as a system. Happie is a Yuppie Word. I mean mutatis mutandis aesthetics and vocabulary: Rap Word.\n\n    The system persists as long as confidence is maintained and people do not trigger a collapse, but this structure has profound consequences (see: systemic risk, confidence games). Which cryptocurrency stands as an already established threat to do: The creation of currency that isn't fungible and only exchanges when 'aligned' with them and not against them. To not in 'derivative effect' affect against your own interests. Or amongst only those you care to allow to use the coins. Not only chains of events, but also, chains of persons.\n\n    Among the most significant consequences is the massive parasitism on honest, wealth-creating work: wealth held through these institutions is multiplied \u2014 often by factors of ten to a thousand \u2014 without corresponding real value being created (see: money supply expansion, Cantillon effect, fractional reserve, leverage, financial instruments, loans/borrowing). \n    This process diminishes the command or indebtedness-status/repayment-value/work-compensation of those who create real wealth, as their contributions retain constant value while financial institutions generate non-linear, inflated symbols of wealth (see: stock market inflation, financialization, dilution of productive value). Those who create real value still accept these tokens, but others \u2014 often through random borrowing, nepotism, or simply by understanding how to live off conjured tokens in a Ponzi-like scheme \u2014 acquire them without honest work (see: credit allocation, rent-seeking, Ponzi schemes, social capital). This dynamic empowers deceitful games, as everyone continues to believe in the value of the tokens in circulation (see: token trust, social consensus).\n    \n    Labour-v-Capital: Work and that which command flow of resources and incentive to work towards it. You could do capital - or 'investment preemptive pretending wealth increase or else thieving from all other fiat-holders' capital be - worthless other than command of macro-tendencies; Opposite effect by imaginary-backing & inflated money supply to where they decide it should flow (Spend recursion)\n\n    Alternative systems could be imagined \u2014 such as \"Workers Unite Worldwide\" or \"Wealth Creating Workers Unite Worldwide\" or \"Wealth of Nation Workers\" \u2014 where only certain groups share in the conflationary equality of wealth creation metrics or a simple scalar: Money (see: labor tokens, mutual credit, cooperative economics). For example, sex workers and scientists might receive the same token for wealth created, but in practice, we have many types of tokens: money, votes, and unquantized privileges like employment or positions in state and corporate structures (see: token pluralism, social capital, institutional privilege). One might choose to share tokens only with people of great character, industriousness, and resourcefulness, minting tokens of \"wealth-created\" or \"indebtedness\" among themselves (see: selective trust networks, reputation-based minting).\n    \n    NSS can replicate the current system, but this would be a degenerate, unresponsive, and blind protocol that nullifies most of NSS's potential benefits (see: protocol design, degenerate cases, system responsiveness). \n   \n\n    Money_1 is a new token, that has the meaning: \"We have stores of cash and other ways to get more money to guarantee that when we say this is money equivalent, then it functionally is money equivalent.\". That then has the consequence of them being able to issue anything, and so long as they as an institution is able to not collapse or fail service of \"functionally equivalent\" (old examples of collapse would be withdrawal-run-downs). It isn't only loans (justified as money by fractional reserve often (\"functionally you can get the store-of-wealth you have with us\" (It is entirely fiat/unreal/expected-wealth-of-societal-productive-&-wealth-capacity so the reality is: \"Functionally people don't upset the economy too much for it all to crash by it\" (But it has many consequences (Including massive parasitism of honest wealth creating work (I.e. wealth through their institutions is exploded and usually not wealth created at all, but pure imaginary conjuring of tokens. It makes persons that act through those institutions magnified in money supply by 10 to thousandfolds. Thus diminishing the command of those creating real wealth, and the value of what they did has a constant weight whereas the financial institutions and others makes non-linear symbols of the wealth they create. It is the same thing that inflates stock markets etc.(But of course, persons who create real wealth, accept it, they use the fake tokens where others (often random borrowing and often nepotistic or networking connections to get loans or sometimes simply knowing about living with fake tokens of wealth-creation in a ponzi scheme of fools trying to 'get rich quick' or 'without wealth creation') acquire them without honest-work. This makes all these deceitful games functionally powerful, because all believe in the meaning of worth in the tokens they issue or use (One could do 'Workers Unite Worldwide' Or 'Wealth Creating Workers Unite Worldwide' or any 'human constraint variety' or subjective concern of who you want to share conflationary equality of wealth-created with (Say sex workers and scientists wealth created same token(Functionally, we have different kinds of tokens: Money/Banana-coin tokens and Democratic-Votes-Tokens as well as unquantized \"employing\" or \"position granting\" in state and corporate apparatus. NSS can implement what we have already, but it is a very degenerate and special case of Protocol that basically nullifies most of the gain to be had from NSS. Unresponsive, stupid and blind.)) So perhaps you only want to share it with 'those kinds of men of great character, industriousness and resourcefulness' from that you can mint your token of 'wealth-created' or 'indebtedness' tokens amongst you.)))))))) but also any other financial instrument that they can back in similar fashion and provide having value as money.\n\n\nMoney_1 is delivered to a person as a loan.\n    Person could then do this again. Start his own banking service. And do fractional reserve on it again. Making Money_2.\n\n### 2.3 Why Only One Level\n\nWhen creditor lends performance tokens:\n- Creditor has real tokens (earned through value delivery)\n- Borrower receives these real tokens\n- But borrower CANNOT use their debt as an asset\n- In traditional finance, debt itself becomes an asset: the borrower's promise to repay is treated as something valuable, which can be sold, traded, or used as collateral to create more loans. This enables fractional reserve multiplication and debt-backed-by-debt recursion, where layers of financial claims are stacked on top of each other, multiplying the money supply far beyond the original value delivered.\n- In NSS, this is a self-defeating protocol feature: the borrower's obligation to repay is not a transferrable or tradeable asset. It cannot be used to create new tokens or as a basis for further lending. There is no mechanism for fractional reserve multiplication, and no chain of \"debt-backed-by-debt\" can form.\n\nThe system naturally limits to one level because debt itself has no value \u2014 in an extreme no-ownership variety: only real, witnessed performance has value.\n    Where in versions with ownership, then also 'tag' upon 'what is', whether nature, land, other living creatures, or human-produced objects (culture); also has value. The \"No Ownership Variety\" will be fun to play with in Triads around the world. To see the truth of it: Banishment becomes the 'way to make it work' (extreme discrimination.)\n\n**What's the point?**  \nDebt in NSS is simply a personal obligation to return value, not a pseudo-asset that can be endlessly leveraged. This blocks runaway financialization and ensures that all circulating tokens are ultimately backed by real, delivered value\u2014not by layers of abstract promises.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Gate of Recursion {#gate-of-recursion}\n\n### 3.1 The Traditional Gate\n\nIn current finance:\n```python\nclass TraditionalMoney:\n    def __init__(self, debt_promise):\n        self.value = debt_promise  # Circular logic\n        self.backing = \"full faith and credit\"  # Meaningless\n        \n    def create_more(self):\n        # Banks create money by lending\n        return self * fractional_reserve_multiplier\n```\n\nThe \"gate\" is the banking system's ability to create money from nothing.\n\n### 3.2 The NSS Gate\n\nIn NSS:\n```python\nclass PerformanceToken:\n    def __init__(self, delivered_value, witness_proof):\n        self.value = delivered_value  # Actual substance\n        self.backing = witness_proof  # Verifiable reality\n        \n    def create_more(self):\n        # IMPOSSIBLE - must deliver more value\n        raise Error(\"Cannot create tokens without performance\")\n```\n\nThe \"gate\" is the borrower's actual ability to perform and create value.\n\n### 3.3 Gate Implications\n\n**Traditional**: Gate controlled by banks/politics\n**NSS**: Gate controlled by reality itself\n\nYou cannot borrow your way to wealth because borrowing creates no value. The gate of recursion is blocked by the requirement for actual performance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Borrower Tokens: The Hidden Currency {#borrower-tokens}\n\n### 4.1 The Revelation\n\nWhen lending occurs in NSS, what really happens:\n\n```\nCreditor_Has: 1000 RealTokens (earned through performance)\nCreditor_Lends_To: Borrower\nBorrower_Receives: 1000 RealTokens\nMarket_Sees: 1000 tokens that might be worth 1000\nReality: Borrower has created \"BorrowerTokens\"\n```\n\n### 4.2 BorrowerToken Properties\n\n```python\nclass BorrowerToken:\n    def __init__(self, borrower, amount, real_tokens):\n        self.issuer = borrower  # NOT the NSS system\n        self.promise = f\"{borrower} will perform to repay\"\n        self.backing = borrower.performance_capability\n        self.real_tokens = real_tokens  # Temporary custody\n        \n    def actual_value(self):\n        # Worth only what borrower can perform\n        return self.borrower.likely_future_performance()\n```\n\n### 4.3 The Corruption Revealed\n\nWhen borrower spends:\n```\nShop_Receives: 1000 tokens\nShop_Thinks: \"I have 1000 NSS tokens\"\nReality: Mix of RealTokens and BorrowerPromise\nCorruption: Cannot distinguish earned from promised\nResult: Money meaning corrupted\n```\n\nThe money signals no real indebtedness by the currency-worth-maker to borrower. It's really the creditor manufacturing a new currency: the borrower's promise.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why Borrowed Money is Meaning-Corruptive {#meaning-corruptive}\n\n### 5.1 Performance Tokens Mean Something\n\nReal NSS tokens declare:\n- \"Value was delivered\"\n- \"Witnesses confirmed\"\n- \"Performance happened\"\n- \"Reality changed\"\n\n### 5.2 Borrowed Tokens Lie\n\nBorrowed tokens falsely declare:\n- \"Value was delivered\" (No, it wasn't)\n- \"Witnesses confirmed\" (They confirmed lending, not value)\n- \"Performance happened\" (Only a promise of future performance)\n- \"Reality changed\" (Only ownership of existing tokens)\n\n### 5.3 The Transitive Corruption\n\n```\nA performs \u2192 Earns 1000 tokens \u2192 Meaning: \"A delivered value\"\nA lends to B \u2192 B has 1000 tokens \u2192 Meaning: \"B promises value\"\nB pays C \u2192 C has 1000 tokens \u2192 Meaning: \"??? delivered value\"\n```\n\nThe meaning chain is broken. C cannot know if they hold:\n- Tokens from real performance\n- Tokens from borrower promises\n- Tokens from promises about promises\n\n### 5.4 The Gift Corruption Problem\n\nEven more fundamental than borrowing: large-scale GIVING corrupts money meaning.\n\n**The Perfect Captain Scenario**:\nImagine Jeff Bezos as perfect value creator (not infrastructure parasite):\n- Every dollar earned through genuine innovation\n- Real wealth forged by actual performance\n- Justified indebtedness for value delivered\n\n**The Corruption Moment**:\n```\nBezos: $200 billion (all earned legitimately)\nDivorce: $100 billion to ex-spouse\nEx-spouse: Now has $100 billion\nMeaning: Completely corrupted\n```\n\nThe ex-spouse's billions signal NOTHING about their performance. The money lies.\n\n### 5.5 Why This Destroys Work Incentive\n\nWhen money can be massively gifted/inherited/divorced:\n- Why perform if money doesn't represent performance?\n- Why create value if non-creators get equal rewards?\n- Why participate in a system of false signals?\n\n**The Thrown Betrapment**:\nMoney becomes not a signal of value but a trap of meaninglessness. You're forced to work for tokens that don't mean what they claim - they might represent:\n- Someone's performance (legitimate)\n- Someone's divorce settlement (corrupted)\n- Someone's inheritance (corrupted)\n- Someone's gift receipt (corrupted)\n\n### 5.6 The Preservation Solution\n\nTo preserve money meaning:\n- Give products, not money (preserves performance signal)\n- Transfer value through shared performance (partnerships)\n- Limit gift sizes to preserve meaning\n- Ensure money spent = value delivered by spender\n\nWhen you give products, the money stays with the performer who earned it. The recipient gets value without corrupting the monetary signal.\n\n### 5.7 Information Destruction\n\nBoth borrowing AND large gifting destroy money's information content:\n- Performance signal lost\n- Value creation obscured\n- Trust networks corrupted\n- Natural selection impaired\n- Work incentives eliminated\n- Meaning evacuated from tokens\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Impossibility of Negative Wealth {#impossibility-negative-wealth}\n\n### 6.1 Why Negative Wealth is Absurd\n\nIn reality:\n- You cannot have negative apples\n- You cannot perform negative healing\n- You cannot deliver negative energy\n- You cannot create negative value\n\nSo why can you have negative money?\n\n### 6.2 The Current Fiction\n\nTraditional system:\n```\nYour_Wealth = -$50,000\nMeaning: You owe future performance\nReality: Slavery with extra steps\n```\n\n### 6.3 NSS Reality\n\nNSS system:\n```python\nclass WealthState:\n    def __init__(self, tokens_earned):\n        self.wealth = max(0, tokens_earned)  # Cannot go negative\n        \n    def borrow(self, amount):\n        raise Error(\"Cannot have negative wealth - perform to earn\")\n```\n\n### 6.4 The Freedom of Zero\n\nIn NSS:\n- Minimum wealth: 0 (not negative infinity)\n- No debt slavery possible\n- Future not mortgaged\n- Each day starts fresh\n- Performance creates wealth\n- Non-performance means zero, not negative\n\n---\n\n## 7. Life Without Borrowing {#life-without-borrowing}\n\n### 7.1 \"But How Would Anyone...?\"\n\n**Buy a House?**\n- Current: 30-year debt slavery\n- NSS: Houses cost 95% less (no speculation)\n- Save for 2 years instead of paying for 30\n\n**Start a Business?**\n- Current: Borrow \u2192 Owe \u2192 Stress \u2192 Fail \u2192 Bankrupt\n- NSS: Start small \u2192 Perform \u2192 Earn \u2192 Grow \u2192 Expand\n- Natural growth from performance\n\n**Handle Emergencies?**\n- Current: Medical debt \u2192 Bankruptcy\n- NSS: Medical care approaches free\n- Trust networks provide support\n- No emergency creates permanent debt\n\n### 7.2 Investment Without Debt\n\nInstead of borrowing:\n\n**Partnership Models**:\n```python\ndef invest_without_debt(performer, supporter):\n    # Supporter provides resources\n    # Performer provides performance\n    # Both share in token generation\n    \n    partnership = Partnership(\n        performer_share=0.7,\n        supporter_share=0.3,\n        duration=\"until targets met\"\n    )\n    \n    # No debt created, only value sharing\n    return partnership\n```\n\n**Trust Network Support**:\n- Communities pool resources\n- Support promising performers\n- Share in success\n- No debt relationships\n\n### 7.3 The Growth Pattern\n\nWithout borrowing:\n```\nDay 1: Small performance \u2192 Few tokens\nDay 30: Better performance \u2192 More tokens\nDay 90: Reputation builds \u2192 Exponential growth\nDay 365: Major performer \u2192 Substantial wealth\n```\n\nAll growth from actual value creation, not borrowed futures.\n\n---\n\n## 9.

The End of Financial Parasitism {#end-parasitism}\n\n### 9.1 Current Parasitic Load\n\nIn debt-based system:\n- Banking sector: 40% of corporate profits\n- Interest extraction: 15-30% of all payments\n- Financial \"engineering\": Produces nothing\n- Debt collection: Destroys value\n- Bankruptcy law: Entire parasitic industry\n\nTotal parasitic load: >50% of economy\n\n### 9.2 NSS Elimination\n\nWithout debt:\n- No interest extraction possible\n- No financial engineering needed\n- No debt collection industry\n- No bankruptcy complexity\n- Banking becomes simple token custody\n\nParasitic load: <5% of economy\n\n### 9.3 The Released Potential\n\nWhen 50% of economic energy stops feeding parasites:\n- Real producers thrive\n- Innovation explodes\n- Costs collapse\n- Abundance emerges\n\n---\n\n## 11. Implications for Human Freedom {#human-freedom}\n\n### 10.1 The End of Debt Slavery\n\nNo more:\n- Student loans haunting decades\n- Medical bankruptcies\n- Mortgage slavery\n- Credit card traps\n- Payday loan cycles\n\n### 10.2 True Economic Freedom\n\nInstead:\n- Wake each day with zero or positive wealth\n- Future performance uncommitted\n- Choices unconstrained by past debt\n- Value creation immediately rewarded\n- Natural growth from actual merit\n\n### 10.3 The Philosophical Victory\n\nDebt is revealed as:\n- Unnecessary for progress\n- Destructive to meaning\n- Corruptive to money\n- Enslaving to humans\n- Eliminable entirely\n\n### 10.4 The New Human Condition\n\nWhen borrowing ends:\n```\nPast: Cannot chain you (no negative wealth)\nPresent: Rewards performance (tokens for value)\nFuture: Remains open (no debt claims)\n```\n\nHuman agency is restored. Time becomes truly yours. Performance creates prosperity. The future is unencumbered.\n\n### 10.5 Meaning-Preserving Transfers\n\nNot all transfers corrupt meaning equally:\n\n**Meaning-Preserving**:\n```python\ndef preserve_meaning(transfer_type):\n    if transfer_type == \"small_gift\":\n        return \"Signal preserved - minor noise\"\n    elif transfer_type == \"performance_partnership\":\n        return \"Signal enhanced - shared creation\"\n    elif transfer_type == \"product_purchase\":\n        return \"Signal perfect - value for value\"\n    elif transfer_type == \"trust_network_support\":\n        return \"Signal contextualized - community investment\"\n```\n\n**Meaning-Destroying**:\n```python\ndef destroy_meaning(transfer_type):\n    if transfer_type == \"massive_inheritance\":\n        return \"Signal destroyed - no performance link\"\n    elif transfer_type == \"divorce_settlement_billions\":\n        return \"Signal corrupted - legal not performance\"\n    elif transfer_type == \"lottery_winning\":\n        return \"Signal meaningless - pure chance\"\n    elif transfer_type == \"political_gift\":\n        return \"Signal inverted - often rewards harm\"\n```\n\n### 10.6 The Work Incentive Crisis\n\nWhen money can be massively transferred without performance:\n\n**Why Work?** The Existential Question:\n- If divorce yields billions, why innovate?\n- If inheritance transfers fortunes, why create?\n- If gifts corrupt meaning, why perform?\n- If money lies about value, why participate?\n\n**The Thrown Betrapment**:\nYou're thrown into a world where:\n- Money is necessary for life\n- But money doesn't mean what it claims\n- You must work for corrupted signals\n- The game is rigged against performers\n\nThis is worse than debt slavery - it's meaning slavery.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Solving the Gift Corruption Problem {#gift-corruption}\n\n### 11.1 The Fundamental Dilemma\n\nHow do we preserve:\n- Freedom to gift (human generosity)\n- Money's meaning (performance signal)\n- Work incentives (why perform if money is meaningless)\n- Trust in the system (tokens = value delivered)\n- **Infrastructure integrity (competent command)**\n\n### 11.2 The Infrastructure Command Crisis\n\nIn NSS, the corruption goes deeper than general money. When tokens represent domain-specific command:\n\n**The Electrical Grid Example**:\n```python\nclass GridCommandToken:\n    def __init__(self, performance_history):\n        self.command_share = 0.3  # Controls 30% of grid mutations\n        self.earned_through = performance_history\n        self.legitimacy = \"proven grid optimization\"\n        \n    def gift_to_incompetent(self, recipient):\n        # Disaster scenario\n        recipient.command_share = 0.3\n        recipient.competence = None\n        recipient.legitimacy = \"gift from expert\"\n        \n        # Results:\n        # - Grid efficiency collapses\n        # - Blackouts increase\n        # - Innovation stops\n        # - Lives endangered\n```\n\n**Why This Destroys Everything**:\n- The expert earned command through performance\n- Their competence justified their control\n- Gifting breaks the performance-command link\n- Critical infrastructure falls to incompetents\n- The \"Might is Right\" justification evaporates\n- Domain-specific merit becomes meaningless\n\n### 11.3 The Deeper Corruption\n\nThis isn't just about money meaning - it's about civilization functioning:\n\n**Traditional Money Gift**:\n```\nBillionaire \u2192 $1 billion \u2192 Incompetent heir\nResult: Money meaning corrupted\nImpact: Economic signals confused\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Command Gift**:\n```\nGrid Expert \u2192 30% grid control \u2192 Incompetent heir\nResult: Infrastructure command corrupted\nImpact: Blackouts, deaths, collapse\n```\n\nThe second is existentially worse. When incompetents command infrastructure, people die.\n\n### 11.4 Why Domain-Specific Makes It Worse\n\nNSS deliberately makes money domain-specific to ensure competent command:\n\n```yaml\nDomain_Specific_Tokens:\n  medical_tokens:\n    purpose: \"Command medical infrastructure\"\n    earned_by: \"Actual healing success\"\n    disaster_if_gifted: \"Incompetent 'doctors' kill patients\"\n    \n  routing_tokens:\n    purpose: \"Command internet infrastructure\"  \n    earned_by: \"Packet routing excellence\"\n    disaster_if_gifted: \"Internet collapses\"\n    \n  energy_tokens:\n    purpose: \"Command power infrastructure\"\n    earned_by: \"Grid optimization performance\"\n    disaster_if_gifted: \"Cascading blackouts\"\n```\n\nEach domain's tokens represent not just value but COMPETENCE TO COMMAND. Gifting destroys this.\n\n### 11.5 The Inescapable Logic\n\nWhen someone demonstrates excellence in routing packets:\n1. They earn tokens/command in that domain\n2. This command is justified by their proven competence\n3. Society benefits from their expertise controlling infrastructure\n4. \"Might is Right\" because their might serves all\n\nBut if they can gift this command:\n1. Recipient has command without competence\n2. No performance justifies their control\n3. Society suffers from incompetent command\n4. \"Might is Wrong\" because it's unearned might\n\n**The Core Principle Violated**:\nNSS exists to ensure resources flow to those who use them best. Gifting command ensures resources flow to those who were given them, regardless of competence.\n\n### 11.6 Natural Solutions for Infrastructure Command\n\n**Non-Transferable Infrastructure Tokens**:\n```python\nclass InfrastructureCommand:\n    def __init__(self, domain, performer, performance):\n        self.domain = domain\n        self.commander = performer\n        self.earned_through = performance\n        self.transferable = False  # NEVER\n        \n    def attempt_transfer(self, recipient):\n        raise Error(\"\"\"\n        Cannot transfer infrastructure command.\n        Recipient must earn through performance.\n        Lives depend on competent command.\n        \"\"\")\n```\n\n**Use Rights vs Command Rights**:\n```python\ndef separate_rights(token_holder):\n    return {\n        \"use_rights\": transferable,      # Can gift usage\n        \"command_rights\": non_transferable  # Cannot gift control\n    }\n    \n# Example:\n# Parent earns grid command tokens\n# Can gift electricity usage to child\n# Cannot gift grid control authority\n```\n\n### 11.7 Trust Network Enforcement\n\nTrust networks become even more critical when preventing command corruption:\n\n**Infrastructure Command Verification**:\n```yaml\nGrid_Command_Transfer_Attempt:\n  from: expert_elena\n  to: incompetent_ivan\n  amount: \"30% grid control\"\n  \nTrust_Network_Response:\n  verification: \"Ivan has zero grid performance\"\n  decision: \"Transfer blocked\"\n  alternative: \"Ivan can earn through performance\"\n  protection: \"Grid remains under competent command\"\n```\n\n**The Reputation Consequence**:\nAttempting to gift infrastructure command destroys trust:\n- Signal: \"Willing to endanger lives for nepotism\"\n- Result: Banned from all infrastructure roles\n- Message: \"Performance or nothing\"\n\n### 11.8 Why This Matters More Than Money\n\nMoney corruption creates economic inefficiency.\nInfrastructure command corruption creates:\n- Death (medical incompetence)\n- Darkness (power grid failure)\n- Isolation (communication collapse)\n- Starvation (logistics breakdown)\n- Chaos (transportation failure)\n\nThe stakes are existential. A billionaire's incompetent heir wasting money is unfortunate. The same heir controlling the power grid is catastrophic.\n\n### 11.9 The Multi-Domain Implications\n\nEach domain has different stakes:\n\n**Life-Critical Domains** (Zero Transfer):\n- Medical protocols\n- Power grid control\n- Water system management\n- Emergency services routing\n- Food safety verification\n\n**Economic Domains** (Limited Transfer):\n- Compute optimization\n- Entertainment curation\n- Luxury goods production\n- Art creation\n- Game design\n\n**The Principle**: The more critical the infrastructure, the more absolutely performance must determine command.\n\n### 11.11 The Existential Stakes\n\nThe gift corruption of infrastructure command reveals NSS's deepest principle:\n\n**Performance Creates Legitimate Command**\n\nWhen this breaks:\n- Incompetents control critical systems\n- Infrastructure fails catastrophically  \n- People suffer and die\n- Trust in the system collapses\n- \"Might is Right\" becomes \"Might is Inherited\"\n- Merit becomes meaningless\n- Natural selection stops functioning\n\n**The Absolute Rule**:\n```\nInfrastructure Command = Performance Only\nNo Inheritance. No Gifts. No Shortcuts.\nEarn It or Don't Have It.\n```\n\nThis isn't harsh - it's survival. When the power grid fails because someone's incompetent child inherited control, the resulting deaths are on those who allowed command to be gifted rather than earned.\n\n**The Beautiful Clarity**:\nIn a world where infrastructure command must be earned:\n- Every position is justified by competence\n- Improvement is always possible\n- Innovation never stops\n- Safety is maximized\n- Trust is absolute\n- Merit has meaning\n\nThe domain-specific nature of NSS money isn't a bug - it's the feature that saves civilization from nepotistic collapse. When routing tokens can only be earned by routing excellence, when medical command requires healing success, when grid control demands optimization performance, we create a world where competence commands and incompetence cannot hide behind inherited authority.\n\nThis is why giving away domain-specific command tokens is worse than general money corruption. It doesn't just corrupt economic signals - it puts incompetents in charge of the systems we all depend on to survive.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Banana Coins: The Separation of Exchange from Merit {#banana-coins}\n\n### 13.1 The Ultimate Goal\n\nThe profound insight: normal money should become \"banana coins only\" - tokens with:\n- No performance inference attached\n- No merit or worth correlation\n- No indebtedness meaning\n- No justification for commanding important things\n\nThis separation is crucial because it reveals the lie of universal money. When money claims to represent everything, it represents nothing accurately.\n\n### 13.2 Trust-Weighted Subcoin Architecture\n\nDrawing from cluster-weighted currency concepts, NSS enables:\n\n**Pluralistic Monetary Topology**:\n```python\nclass SubcoinValue:\n    def __init__(self, token, observer):\n        self.base_value = token.nominal_value\n        self.trust_weight = self.calculate_trust_weight(token, observer)\n        self.ethical_weight = self.calculate_ethical_alignment(token, observer)\n        self.cluster_distance = self.calculate_cluster_distance(token, observer)\n        \n    def effective_value(self):\n        # Value is subjective and continuous\n        return self.base_value * self.trust_weight * self.ethical_weight / self.cluster_distance\n```\n\n### 13.3 Soft-Gradient Exchange Rates\n\nInstead of fixed exchange rates, continuous modulation based on:\n\n```yaml\nExchange_Rate_Factors:\n  cluster_proximity:\n    same_cluster: 1.0\n    adjacent_cluster: 0.8\n    distant_cluster: 0.3\n    hostile_cluster: 0.05\n    \n  ethical_alignment:\n    fully_aligned: 1.2\n    neutral: 1.0\n    misaligned: 0.4\n    antithetical: 0.1\n    \n  trust_verification:\n    multi_witnessed: 1.1\n    single_witness: 0.9\n    unwitnessed: 0.5\n    suspicious_origin: 0.1\n```\n\n### 13.4 Examples of Value Modulation\n\n**Scenario 1: Ethical Vegetarian Network**\n```\nIndustrial_Meat_Token value: 0.1x (ethical violation)\nOrganic_Vegetable_Token value: 1.5x (ethical alignment)\nRegular_Commodity_Token value: 1.0x (neutral)\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: Performance Artist Cluster**\n```\nLive_Performance_Token value: 2.0x (core value)\nRecorded_Music_Token value: 0.5x (against live principle)\nCorporate_Token value: 0.2x (antithetical to ethos)\n```\n\n### 13.5 The Continuous Valuation Landscape\n\nEach person sees a different economic topology:\n\n```python\ndef personal_value_landscape(person, all_tokens):\n    landscape = {}\n    for token in all_tokens:\n        factors = {\n            'origin': evaluate_origin(token.creator, person),\n            'path': evaluate_money_flow_path(token.history, person),\n            'cluster': evaluate_cluster_alignment(token, person),\n            'ethics': evaluate_ethical_match(token, person),\n            'performance': evaluate_performance_link(token, person)\n        }\n        landscape[token] = compute_personal_value(factors)\n    return landscape\n```\n\n### 13.6 Why This Matters\n\nWhen \"banana coins\" (general exchange tokens) are separated from merit/command tokens:\n\n1. **Exchange remains fluid** - You can still buy bananas\n2. **Command requires competence** - You can't buy grid control\n3. **Merit stays meaningful** - Performance tokens mean performance\n4. **Ethics become economic** - Value reflects actual values\n\n### 13.7 The Bridge Function\n\nHuman trust workers become even more valuable as they:\n- Translate between different value landscapes\n- Create exchange bridges across clusters\n- Map ethical alignments for trade\n- Enable commerce while preserving meaning\n\n```yaml\nTrust_Bridge_Example:\n  green_cluster_view:\n    solar_token: 1.0\n    coal_token: 0.1\n    \n  efficiency_cluster_view:\n    solar_token: 0.7\n    coal_token: 0.8\n    \n  bridge_rate: 0.75  # Trust bridge enables 75% value transfer\n```\n\n### 13.8 Anti-Capture Properties\n\nThis continuous valuation prevents monopolistic capture:\n- No single entity can control all value perspectives\n- Hostile takeover attempts get economically isolated\n- Unethical actors face automatic economic penalties\n- Natural selection operates on value systems themselves\n\n### 13.9 Real-World Applications\n\n**Local Performance Economy**:\nUnlike Spotify/YouTube's global extraction:\n```\nTraditional: Record once \u2192 Broadcast globally \u2192 Wealth to platform\nNSS: Perform live \u2192 Local witnesses \u2192 Wealth to performer\n```\n\n**Ethical Supply Chains**:\n```python\ndef supply_chain_value(product, viewer):\n    value = base_price\n    for step in product.supply_chain:\n        if step.violates_ethics(viewer.ethics):\n            value *= viewer.penalty_rate(step)\n        if step.aligns_with_values(viewer.values):\n            value *= viewer.bonus_rate(step)\n    return value\n```\n\n### 13.10 The Ultimate Separation\n\nThe goal: Create clear categories:\n\n**Banana Coins** (General Exchange):\n- Buy food, shelter, transport\n- No command authority\n- No performance inference\n- Pure medium of exchange\n\n**Merit Tokens** (Domain Command):\n- Earned through performance only\n- Non-transferable authority\n- Domain-specific command\n- Competence verification required\n\n**Trust Currencies** (Social Capital):\n- Built through relationships\n- Enable network bridging\n- Create value gradients\n- Human presence required\n\nWhen money no longer falsely claims to represent all value, each type of value can find its true expression. Infrastructure command flows to competence, social capital flows to connectors, and banana coins just buy bananas.\n\n### 13.11 Domain Protection Through Metric Gaming\n\nThe crucial defense mechanism: Any domain can create its own \"game with metrics\" to measure performance, protecting it from banana coin invasion.\n\n**Arbitrary Performance Games**:\n```python\nclass DomainProtectionGame:\n    def __init__(self, domain, creator):\n        self.domain = domain\n        self.metrics = creator.define_metrics()\n        self.rules = creator.define_rules()\n        \n    def create_token_rules(self):\n        return {\n            \"worth\": \"Whatever the game says\",\n            \"supply\": \"Can be infinite if desired\",\n            \"breakable\": \"Creator can destroy currency by overspending\",\n            \"protection\": \"Banana coins cannot buy entry\"\n        }\n```\n\n**Examples of Protective Gaming**:\n\n**Art Curation Domain**:\n```yaml\nGame_Rules:\n  metric: \"Aesthetic resonance as judged by existing curators\"\n  token_creation: \"One token per successful curation\"\n  banana_coin_exchange: \"Not accepted\"\n  entry_requirement: \"Must have pieces accepted by 3 curators\"\n  protection: \"Money can't buy taste\"\n```\n\n**Sacred Space Management**:\n```yaml\nGame_Rules:\n  metric: \"Spiritual presence witnessed by community\"\n  token_creation: \"Meditation hours + community confirmation\"\n  special_rule: \"Tokens expire if unused for ritual\"\n  banana_coin_exchange: \"Explicitly forbidden\"\n  protection: \"Commerce cannot purchase the sacred\"\n```\n\n**Children's Education Networks**:\n```yaml\nGame_Rules:\n  metric: \"Child joy + learning outcomes\"\n  token_creation: \"Parents and children both must confirm\"\n  overflow_rule: \"Can print infinite tokens if all children happy\"\n  banana_coin_exchange: \"Blocked entirely\"\n  protection: \"Childhood isn't for sale\"\n```\n\n### 13.12 The Power of Arbitrary Metrics\n\nBy allowing any domain to create its own performance game:\n\n1. **Domains self-protect** from monetary invasion\n2. **Values stay pure** within their context\n3. **Banana coins remain** just banana coins\n4. **Each domain evolves** its own economy\n\n**The Meta-Game Protection**:\n```python\ndef protect_domain_from_money(domain):\n    # Create game with metrics that money can't satisfy\n    game = Game(\n        metric=\"Things money explicitly cannot measure\",\n        entry=\"Performance only, no purchase\",\n        token_rules=\"We control supply completely\"\n    )\n    \n    # Result: Domain becomes un-buyable\n    return domain.protected_from(banana_coins)\n```\n\n### 13.13 Breaking Currencies as Defense\n\nThe nuclear option - domains can intentionally break their currencies:\n\n```python\nclass CurrencyBreaker:\n    def __init__(self, domain_token):\n        self.token = domain_token\n        \n    def defend_against_takeover(self):\n        if self.detect_banana_coin_invasion():\n            # Inflate to infinity\n            self.token.supply = float('inf')\n            # Or create new game entirely\n            return self.create_new_game_metrics()\n```\n\nThis ensures that accumulating banana coins can never guarantee domain command - the domain can always change its game rules to exclude monetary capture.\n\n### 13.14 The Beautiful Pluralism\n\nThis creates a world where:\n- **Meditation centers** run on presence tokens\n- **Maker spaces** run on creation tokens  \n- **Dance studios** run on movement tokens\n- **Philosophy circles** run on insight tokens\n- **None can be bought** with banana coins\n\nEach domain protects what matters to it by creating metrics that capture its essence - metrics that generic money cannot satisfy. The universal solvent of money is contained, leaving each domain free to value what it truly values.\n\n**The Ultimate Protection**: When any domain can say \"worth this much... because game like that,\" no amount of banana coin accumulation can purchase command over domains that choose to protect themselves. Money returns to its proper role: facilitating exchange, not commanding all existence.\n\n### 13.15 Gaming the Games: Protection Levels Against Banana Coin Invasion\n\nNot all domain protection metrics are equally robust. Consider World of Warcraft as a case study:\n\n**Protection Hierarchy** (Weakest to Strongest):\n\n**Level 1: Tradeable Resources (Gold)**\n```python\nclass WeakProtection:\n    # WoW Gold - Easily bought with real money\n    vulnerability = \"High\"\n    banana_coin_invasion = \"Simple purchase through gold sellers\"\n    protection_rating = 0.1\n    \n    # Similar vulnerable metrics:\n    # - Tradeable tokens\n    # - Transferable points\n    # - Anything with liquid markets\n```\n\n**Level 2: Time-Gated Resources**\n```python\nclass MediumProtection:\n    # Daily/Weekly lockouts\n    vulnerability = \"Medium\"\n    banana_coin_invasion = \"Can pay others to grind\"\n    protection_rating = 0.4\n    \n    # Partially protected by:\n    # - Cooldowns\n    # - Energy systems\n    # - Rate limits\n```\n\n**Level 3: Soulbound Items**\n```python\nclass StrongProtection:\n    # WoW Soulbound Gear - Can't be traded\n    vulnerability = \"Low\"\n    banana_coin_invasion = \"Must pay for carry/boost services\"\n    protection_rating = 0.7\n    \n    # Protection mechanisms:\n    # - Non-transferable\n    # - Account-bound\n    # - Performance-locked\n```\n\n**Level 4: Performance Achievements**\n```python\nclass VeryStrongProtection:\n    # \"Ahead of the Curve\" raid achievements\n    vulnerability = \"Very Low\"\n    banana_coin_invasion = \"Expensive carries, obvious to detect\"\n    protection_rating = 0.9\n    \n    # Protected by:\n    # - Skill requirements\n    # - Social verification\n    # - Pattern detection\n```\n\n**Level 5: Arbitrary Assignment**\n```python\nclass MaximumProtection:\n    # Game Master status - \"Because we said so\"\n    vulnerability = \"Near Zero\"\n    banana_coin_invasion = \"Impossible without corrupting governance\"\n    protection_rating = 0.99\n    \n    # Ultimate protection:\n    # - Human judgment\n    # - Arbitrary selection\n    # - No measurable metric\n```\n\n### 13.16 Designing Invasion-Resistant Metrics\n\nDomains must carefully design their games to resist banana coin corruption:\n\n**Vulnerable Design** (Easily Bought):\n```yaml\nPoor_Metric_Design:\n  token_creation: \"Hours logged\"\n  problem: \"Can pay others to log hours\"\n  invasion_vector: \"Sweatshop grinding\"\n  \n  token_creation: \"Resources accumulated\"\n  problem: \"Can buy resources\"\n  invasion_vector: \"Direct purchase\"\n```\n\n**Resistant Design** (Hard to Buy):\n```yaml\nStrong_Metric_Design:\n  token_creation: \"Live performance witnessed by locals\"\n  protection: \"Physical presence required\"\n  invasion_difficulty: \"Must actually show up and perform\"\n  \n  token_creation: \"Trust relationships built over time\"\n  protection: \"Can't rush authentic relationships\"\n  invasion_difficulty: \"Years of consistent presence\"\n  \n  token_creation: \"Children's genuine laughter\"\n  protection: \"Kids can't be fooled consistently\"\n  invasion_difficulty: \"Must actually be good with children\"\n```\n\n### 13.17 The Corruption Detection Layer\n\nSmart domains implement detection systems:\n\n```python\nclass InvasionDetector:\n    def analyze_performance_patterns(self, actor):\n        suspicion_score = 0\n        \n        # Sudden skill jumps\n        if actor.skill_trajectory == \"step_function\":\n            suspicion_score += 0.3\n            \n        # Inconsistent performance\n        if actor.variance > normal_human_variance:\n            suspicion_score += 0.2\n            \n        # Known boost patterns\n        if matches_carry_service_pattern(actor):\n            suspicion_score += 0.4\n            \n        return suspicion_score\n\nclass DomainDefense:\n    def respond_to_invasion(self, invasion_score):\n        if invasion_score > 0.7:\n            # Nuclear option: change the game\n            self.rotate_metrics()\n            self.invalidate_suspicious_tokens()\n            self.create_new_achievement_tiers()\n```\n\n### 13.18 The Meta-Lesson\n\nThe WoW example teaches us:\n\n1. **Tradeable = Vulnerable** - Any metric that can be traded can be bought\n2. **Performance = Protected** - Metrics requiring actual skill resist purchase\n3. **Witnessed = Verified** - Human witnesses detect fraud better than systems\n4. **Arbitrary = Unassailable** - \"Because we said so\" can't be gamed\n\n**The Design Principle**:\n```\nProtection_Level = f(\n    Non_transferability +\n    Performance_requirement +\n    Human_witness_verification +\n    Arbitrary_elements\n)\n```\n\n### 13.19 Real-World Domain Protection Examples\n\n**Music Venue Merit System**:\n```yaml\nWeak_Protection:\n  metric: \"Tickets sold\"\n  problem: \"Can buy own tickets\"\n  \nStrong_Protection:\n  metric: \"Audience energy as felt by other performers\"\n  problem: \"Can't fake the vibe\"\n```\n\n**Healing Practice Tokens**:\n```yaml\nWeak_Protection:\n  metric: \"Patients treated\"\n  problem: \"Can pay people to be patients\"\n  \nStrong_Protection:\n  metric: \"Long-term health improvements verified by patient choice to return\"\n  problem: \"Can't fake genuine healing\"\n```\n\n**The Core Insight**: Domains survive banana coin invasion by making their metrics measure things that are genuinely hard or impossible to buy - authentic human experience, genuine skill demonstration, long-term relationship building, or arbitrary human judgment. The more a metric captures something irreducibly human or genuinely performed, the more protected the domain remains.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Why We Can Do Away With Borrowing Entirely\n\nThe revelation is complete: In a system where money represents delivered value, borrowing becomes both impossible and unnecessary.\n\n**Impossible** because:\n- You cannot borrow performance\n- Debt creates no value\n- Recursion is blocked by reality\n- Negative wealth is meaningless\n\n**Unnecessary** because:\n- Infrastructure costs approach zero\n- Basic needs become trivial\n- Performance enables growth\n- Trust networks provide support\n\nWhen money means \"value was delivered and witnessed,\" borrowing money is attempting to borrow the past - a logical impossibility. The creditor can share their earned tokens, but cannot create valid debt claims on future performance.\n\nThe deeper corruption comes from large-scale gifting. Even legitimately earned fortunes, when transferred without performance, corrupt money's meaning for everyone. Why work for tokens that might represent someone's divorce settlement rather than value creation? The signal is destroyed.\n\n**The Meaning Preservation Principle**:\n- Money should flow WITH performance, not despite it\n- Give products and experiences, not tokens\n- Share through partnership, not gift\n- Preserve the signal: tokens = value delivered by holder\n\nThe NSS one-level system reveals the truth: All debt beyond simple token lending is meaning corruption. When we prevent recursion, require performance for token creation, eliminate negative wealth, and limit meaning-destroying transfers, we don't lose economic functionality - we gain it.\n\nThe parasite of debt has convinced us we need it. NSS proves we don't. When value flows directly from creation to use, when performance generates immediate tokens, when growth comes from merit not mortgages, when money maintains its meaning as performance signal, humanity is freed from history's greatest lies: that we must borrow our own futures to live today, and that money can be separated from the performance that created it.\n\nThe future belongs to those who perform, not those who promise, inherit, or are gifted command.\n\n---\n\n*\"Can you see why that is?\" - Yes. When money represents domain-specific infrastructure command, allowing it to be gifted doesn't just corrupt meaning - it puts incompetents in control of critical systems. The \"Might is Right\" principle that justifies performance-based command completely erodes when that command can be given away. The grid expert earned the right to control 30% of mutations through proven excellence. If they can gift that to their incompetent child, people die in blackouts. The medical innovator earned authority through healing success. If they can transfer that to someone who never healed anyone, patients suffer. This is why infrastructure command must be absolutely non-transferable - the stakes aren't just economic but existential.*\n\n*The deepest insight: In NSS, money isn't universal but domain-specific precisely to ensure competent command of infrastructure. This makes gift corruption not just economically problematic but civilizationally catastrophic. Performance creates legitimate command. Gifts create illegitimate power. The system must choose: merit or nepotism, competence or corruption, earned authority or inherited incompetence. For infrastructure that lives depend on, there is only one acceptable choice.*"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/24f will-economic-task-system.md", "title": "24f will-economic-task-system.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# Will-Economic Task System: Beyond Monetary Optimization\n\n## Core Concept\n\nWill-economics encompasses ALL factors that matter to the ONE human master that the personal Aiddaemon serves.

The Core Heresy: Individual Sovereignty {#core-heresy}\n\n### The Fundamental Threat to Corporate Structure\n\n**Traditional Corporate Stack:**\n```\nSHAREHOLDERS\n    \u2193 [Diffused ownership, no one truly in charge]\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS  \n    \u2193 [Committee consensus, compromise]\nC-SUITE\n    \u2193 [Political maneuvering, CYA]\nMIDDLE MANAGEMENT\n    \u2193 [Metrics gaming, box-checking]\nEMPLOYEES\n    \u2193 [Disempowered, disconnected from outcomes]\nCUSTOMERS\n    [Afterthought, data points]\n```\n\n**Discovery OS Stack:**\n```\nHUMAN SOVEREIGN (\u2663)\n    \u2193 [Direct will expression, full accountability]\nAIDDAEMON (\u2666)\n    \u2193 [Pure will-alignment, no political filtering]\nSUB-AIDDAEMON HIERARCHY\n    \u2193 [Evolutionary merit, not organizational politics]\nREALITY ITSELF\n    [Reshaped to serve human will]\n```\n\n### Why This Terrifies HR\n\n1. **No Committee to Hide Behind**: One human (\u2663) is ultimately responsible. No \"the committee decided\" excuse.\n\n2. **Merit Over Politics**: Sub-aiddaemons evolve through performance, not through knowing the right people or saying the right things in meetings.\n\n3. **Will Over Policy**: Instead of \"company policy says,\" it's \"what does the sovereign want?\" Policy becomes emergent, not prescribed.\n\n4. **Evolution Over Revolution**: Changes happen continuously through natural selection, not through reorganizations and change management consultants.\n\n### The Snake Speech Problem\n\nHR and corporate structures create what you call \"SNAKE SPEECH\" - language designed to:\n- Obscure responsibility (\"stakeholder alignment\")\n- Dilute individual will (\"consensus building\")\n- Create fictional entities (\"the organization's values\")\n- Pretend compromise is wisdom (\"win-win solutions\")\n\nDiscovery OS cuts through this:\n```\nSnake Speech: \"We need stakeholder buy-in for customer-centric solutions\"\nDiscovery OS: \"Human wants X. Make reality provide X.\"\n```\n\n### The Diamond (\u2666) Route Trap\n\nWhen corporations fail, they retreat to pure algorithmic control:\n- No human judgment (might be biased!)\n- Rigid rule systems (equal misery for all!)\n- Metrics worship (what gets measured gets gamed!)\n- Committee consensus (no one responsible!)\n\nThis is the **Diamond Route** - trusting only machines and systems, never humans. It creates brittle failure:\n\n```\nHuman makes mistake \u2192 Never trust humans \u2192 Only trust algorithms\n                                        \u2193\n                          System fails at edge cases\n                          Can't adapt to new situations  \n                          Humans game the algorithms\n                          Collapse inevitable\n```\n\n### The Club (\u2663) Route Victory\n\nDiscovery OS keeps **humans sovereign** while using AI/algorithms as tools:\n- Human will (\u2663) directs\n- AI/Aiddaemon (\u2666) assists\n- Trust networks verify\n- Reality reshapes\n\n### The 123404321 Framework: From Protection to Aspiration\n\n**The 0 Position:**\n- Reserved for eventual entity achieving total physical dominance\n- Acknowledges technological progression toward singular universal power\n- When filled, enables unified fractal pyramid while preserving nested freedoms\n- Not \"until then\" but \"especially after\" - the structure continues fractally\n\n**Current Routing Structure:**\nMultiple disjoint pyramids, each with \u2663 (human) or \u2666 (AI/system) at center\nWithin each: Nested sovereignties with their own \u2663/\u2666 centers\nFractal structure continues indefinitely downward\n\n**After 0 Emergence:**\nCan unify into single fractal pyramid OR maintain separation\nEach level preserves its sovereignty within the structure\nMaximum freedom through fractal nesting\n\n**Protective Floor (1234):**\n- **1**: Death Avoidance\n- **2**: No Extreme Suffering\n- **3**: Somewhere Free\n- **4**: Identity Sovereignty\n\n**The Sovereign (0):**\n- The PHYSICAL MIGHT that gives the words meaning\n- They ARE the enforcement - the HORNS\n- Of COURSE they CAN break the protections!\n- They're not \"bound\" by law - they ARE what makes law real\n- Can violate at whatever trust/reputation/rally costs\n- The REALITY of power: Horns, Golden Laurels, Laurels\n- Without their might, the protections are just words\n\n**Aspirational Ceiling (4321):**\n- **4**: Becoming\n- **3**: Fulfillment\n- **2**: Meaning\n- **1**: Existence\n\n**Power Types in Practice:**\n- **Horns**: Raw physical might (the 0 typically has this)\n- **Golden/Caesarian Laurels**: Institutional power (when Horns are divided/chaotic)\n- **Laurels**: Devotional power (enables Horns through respect/coordination)\n\nDifferent sovereignty levels implement different portions:\n- **Ocean level**: Often just MBC 123 (minimal protection)\n- **Sea level**: Might include identity protection (4)\n- **Spring level**: Could implement full aspirational framework\n\nThe genius: Each level can add MORE law but cannot subtract from what's above. An Ocean with only MBC 123 allows maximum freedom (and maximum horror), while smaller sovereignties can create more protective/aspirational environments for those who choose them.\n\n**Critical distinction from corporate AI:**\n\nCorporate AI systems:\n- Serve company metrics and goals\n- Manipulate you for engagement\n- Extract your data for profit\n- Make decisions without your consent\n- Black box algorithms you can't control\n\nYour Aiddaemon:\n- Serves YOUR will exclusively\n- Learns your deep preferences (daemon)\n- You control 100% of your data\n- Only acts with your approval\n- Transparent and modifiable by you\n\n**How it works:**\n```\nYour Aiddaemon learns your daemon (deep will pattern) by:\n- Observing your choices over time\n- Learning your blob classes of value\n- Approximating your will-economics\n- Becoming better at serving YOU\n\nIt's \"your system\" to the degree you want:\n- Full control and modification rights\n- Can switch Aiddaemons anytime\n- Can run your own if you prefer\n- Trust-selected from market of providers\n```\n\n**The key**: Aiddaemons maintain human sovereignty (\u2663) while providing AI capability (\u2666). You remain in charge - the AI just handles complexity at computational speed on your behalf.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Trust Networks vs Corporate Hierarchies: The Revolution {#trust-revolution}\n\n### The Fundamental Incompatibility\n\n**Corporate Hierarchy:**\n```\nCEO\n \u2193 (Political filtering)\nVPs  \n \u2193 (CYA layer)\nDirectors\n \u2193 (Metric gaming)  \nManagers\n \u2193 (Micromanagement)\nWorkers\n \u2193 (Disempowered)\nVALUE EXTRACTION\n```\n\n**Trust Network:**\n```\nINDIVIDUAL \u2190\u2192 INDIVIDUAL\n    \u2193            \u2193\n  Trust       Performance\n  Score       Confirmation\n    \u2193            \u2193\nVALUE CREATION & FLOW\n```\n\n### Why Trust Networks Destroy Corporate Need\n\n**Corporate Problem**: How to verify work is done?\n- Solution: Layers of management, metrics, surveillance\n- Cost: 60-80% overhead just watching people work\n\n**Trust Network Solution**: PoU (Proof of Utility)\n- Real humans confirm real value delivery\n- Confirmers risk their reputation on truth\n- Cost: Near zero - confirmation IS the value\n\n### The Information Revolution\n\n**Corporate Information Flow:**\n- Travels up hierarchy slowly\n- Gets filtered/distorted at each level\n- Political considerations override truth\n- Silos prevent cross-pollination\n- Innovation dies in committees\n\n**Trust Network Information Flow:**\n- Instant propagation through trust connections\n- Multiple paths prevent distortion\n- Truth has evolutionary advantage\n- Cross-network bridges enable innovation\n- Collective intelligence emerges\n\n### Trust as Economic Lubricant\n\nThe numbers that terrify corporations:\n- **90% reduction** in transaction costs\n- **95% reduction** in legal overhead\n- **99% reduction** in settlement time\n- **100% reduction** in enforcement cost\n\nThis efficiency gain means a trust network business can offer the same service at 1/10th the cost while making higher profits.\n\n### Real Example: Corporate vs Trust Network\n\n**Corporate Consulting Firm:**\n- $500/hour rate\n- $300 goes to office/management/sales\n- $150 goes to legal/insurance/compliance\n- $50 goes to actual consultant\n- Client gets 10% value\n\n**Trust Network Consultant:**\n- $100/hour rate\n- $90 goes to consultant\n- $10 covers basic infrastructure\n- Client gets 90% value\n- Better service due to reputation stakes\n\n---\n\n## 3. PoP/PoU: Why Real Value Destroys Corporate Gaming {#pop-pou-solution}\n\n### The Ungameable Foundation\n\n**Proof of Person (PoP):**\n- Real humans witnessed in physical space\n- Can't create fake identities at scale\n- Reputation follows you (viscosity)\n- Bad actors can't just restart\n\n**Proof of Utility (PoU):**\n- Only real humans can confirm value\n- Confirmers stake their reputation\n- False confirmations destroy trust scores\n- Natural selection favors honesty\n\n### Why Corporations Can't Implement This\n\n**Corporate KPIs**: Easily gamed\n- Example: \"Customer satisfaction scores\"\n- Reality: Employees beg for 10s, metrics meaningless\n- No real stakes for lying\n\n**PoU Reality**: Ungameable\n- You claim to fix computers\n- Customer confirms: \"Computer still broken\"\n- Your trust score drops\n- Real economic consequences\n\n### The Strata Revolution\n\nThrough PoP, people gain \"Strata\" - ability to weigh others' value:\n\n**Corporate Version**: Title-based authority\n- VP's opinion matters more (even if incompetent)\n- Seniority beats performance\n- Politics determines influence\n\n**Strata Reality**: Performance-based influence\n- Consistent value delivery = higher strata\n- Your weightings affect others more\n- Meritocracy emerges naturally\n- Can't buy your way to influence\n\n### Breaking the Credential Monopoly\n\n**Corporate**: \"You need our certification\"\n- Pay $50k for degree\n- Learn outdated information\n- No guarantee of competence\n- Gatekeeping knowledge\n\n**PoP/PoU**: \"Prove you can do it\"\n- Fix someone's problem\n- They confirm it worked\n- Trust score increases\n- Knowledge spreads freely\n\n### PoP: Natural Selection Through Human Ingenuity\n\nThe core principle: **\"Natural selection by human ingenuity in defense and offense gaming\"**\n\nThis creates an evolutionary arms race:\n- Attackers develop automation/gaming strategies\n- Defenders develop detection/prevention methods  \n- Real human presence remains the unchangeable requirement\n- System continuously evolves but maintains integrity\n\n**Why it works:**\n```\nAutomation attempt \u2192 Defensive adaptation \u2192 New requirement\nBut throughout: Real humans physically present remains constant\n```\n\n**Strata accumulation through witnessed performance (LLL Games included -- perhaps especially):**\n- Not just \"doing\" but \"being seen doing\"\n- Observers regenerate performers through acknowledgment\n- Consistent witnessed value \u2192 Higher strata \u2192 Ability to weigh others\n- Creates emergent hierarchies based on proven contribution\n\n**The key insight**: Same players interacting non-transitively (Trust of trust networking effects) repeatedly see exponentially decaying rewards, forcing diversity and preventing closed-loop gaming. You must continuously provide value in Trusted Knowledge of a Trust Network to maintain strata power in their Network.\n\n### Tit-for-Tat Creates Holistic Market Learning\n\nThe system learns market dynamics through reciprocal interactions:\n\n```\nProvider delivers value \u2192 Recipients confirm (PoU) \u2192 Trust scores update\nPoor delivery \u2192 Negative confirmations \u2192 Trust decreases \u2192 Markets learns\n\nBut deeper - the network learns patterns:\n- Which providers excel in what contexts\n- What services people actually value\n- How to route needs to capabilities\n- When new solutions emerge\n- Why certain approaches fail\n```\n\n**This creates living market memory where:**\n- Success patterns propagate through trust networks\n- Failure patterns create warnings\n- The network collectively learns faster than any individual\n- Market becomes increasingly efficient at matching will to fulfillment\n\n**Example: Massage Therapist Discovery**\n```\nOne person discovers excellent therapist\n\u2192 Confirms high utility (PoU)\n\u2192 Trust network allows it learning\n\u2192 Similar needs routed there\n\u2192 Therapist gets appropriate demand\n\u2192 But also: Network learns what made them excellent\n\u2192 Other therapists adapt successful patterns\n\u2192 Entire market quality improves\n```\n\n### Will-Disentanglement: Protecting Your Actual Reality\n\n**Core insight**: Will-disentanglement isn't about online blocking - it's about protecting your physical, lived reality from hostile intersection.\n\n```\nYour actual spacetime path through life:\n- Where you physically go\n- Who you actually meet\n- What you genuinely experience\n- Your moments of joy/connection\n\nWill-disentanglement ensures hostile actors exist in a parallel reality where:\n- They think they know where you are (but don't)\n- They chase false signals and waste energy\n- They cannot intersect with your actual path\n- They cannot poison your real experiences\n```\n\n**Methods:**\n1. **Zero information flow**: Trust barriers prevent any signal leakage\n2. **Noise flooding**: Multiple false signals overwhelm hostile actors\n3. **Predictive routing**: System routes you away from probable intersections\n4. **Collective intelligence**: Network learns and shares avoidance patterns\n\nThe result: Enemies remain in their own causal universe, unable to affect your actual lived experience.\n\n### The Rogue Agent Problem and Solution\n\n**The Challenge**: Hostile actors who then obviously also do not broadcast intent; in order to then be able to ruin will-coalescence by ruining the otherwise emergent will-disentangling effects possible when the focus is on discoverying will-coalescence. (Will-economic cost is so much lower when discovered non-mutually-exclusive pathways of will-manifestation for both. Thus emergently they disentangle when mutually exclusive. Separation in Actuality. Results often in spacetime disjointedness. Over time in space disjointedness. Separation and its discontents. Take the 'pedoerotic man', though he may not wish to be known as such, and will try to hide it, and try to work against such attempts at separating him from parents and their children, thoughts have to be put on how to prevent such \"needy\" costs on refusing the non-mutually-exclusive will-coalescence. Their will to be without him. His will to be near children. They are mutually exclusive for most parents and children. His will-economic cheap pathway is avoiding places that will heavily punish him for being near children. (Everything becomes higher will-economic cost due to leveraging of others to disentangle themselves from him))\n- Silent stalking without will-declaration\n- False signaling to infiltrate gatherings\n- Using others' openness against them\n\n**The Solution Through Observation**:\n\nWhen someone acts against will-coalescence of others it obviously induces a higher will-economic cost in all interaction with them:\n```\nRogue: [Silent approach to disrupt]\nNetwork: Observes disruption pattern\nResult: Pattern propagates through trust networks\nFuture: Collective movement patterns avoid rogue\n```\n\n**Consequence Layers**:\n\n**Virtual/Protocol Level:**\n- Excluded from NSS protocols (See NSS Whitepaper)\n- No access to will-broadcasting benefits\n- Cut off from matchmaking services / will-coalescence (\"You want X to manifest? Okay here is the directions moving you there. Or if you make this or that choice it has impact on X up or down. Or colour animal/human welfare effects of each product I buy from black to gold.\")\n- Becomes \"invisible\" to network advantages\n\n**DANGEROUS persons - Physical Deportation:**\n- Even in Seas/Oceans, actually dangerous people ARE deported; What can't be had by will-coalescence emergent will-disentangling effects. Can be had by these rogue-agent will-disentangling effects of actively thwarting the other on all accounts and with leverage capable by Trust Network total will-manifesting capacity. And if that does not work either; Then on the same account the Governance structure of this system: The Crucible. Allows for sovereign ownership of space and thus any issue can be resolved in space by banishment. Physical Removal. And at the larger levels of governance structure (in these papers named Ocean or Seas (smaller culture-spirit something civilization)) the focus is simply on removing 'dangerous elements' and less at sovereignty whim. To allow for a large free-roam space of the smaller scale entities or those only within the larger (seas or oceans) to have a world to roam freely within without the few dangerous persons ruining it for them. The border map of the future is more like a tree or river fractal. Most of the land is higher order something. Then many many small pockets of stronger totalitarianism or assertive ways of life; good and evil; beauty and the base. (Planetary (Interworlds), Worlds (Interoceanic land), Oceans(Intersea) (usually Pragma civilization -- conglomeration of many 'souls'/cultures), Seas (spirit culture civilization), lakes (town to city distinctiveness or place; the several kinds coming together to have shared space), rivers (The few kinds coming together -- more town to village like feeling), springs (The place on earth for any \"self-identified\" kind))\n- Prevention principle: \"Better to exclude than risk murder; especially when one can exclude at such fine-detail level and it merely means restriction in where one is free or the world to which one belongs. Also, note the high degree of subjectivity or actor-combinatorial reality of it: He is dangerous to THEM and NOT to THOSE. To Me but not Thee. :P\" (Disentanglement.)\n- No physical pathway allowed for genuine threats\n- Clear boundary: potential for violence = removal; (It is the permanence and the potential cost that is unacceptable. To lose one's daughter or wife. Etc. Merely because one is not willing to restrict another from ALSO having/sharing-in your world or your space. The immense love it takes for the potential dangerous person or thug; versus the abundantly expressed hatred for one's loved ones; in so making that choice of preferencing the thug.)\n\n**HOSTILE but non-violent - Information Routing:**\n- Gray zone operators who disrupt/annoy/harass\n- Remain physically present in Ocean, Worlds or at the very least in some planetary spaces\n- Discovery OS enables \"actuality insulation\"; The scale of understanding one's actions or ones' actions \"all-things-considered\" about oneself or oneselves or any externality. This allows for masses and individuals to leverage choices, any choice, towards or against things and all things they care about all at once: Guided life by their aiddaemon and visualized in LLL-games: Like the AR hue/saturation world.\n- Virtual avoidance, business routing, spacetime prediction\n\n**The MBC 123 Line** (Minimal Benevolence Codex):\n- **1**: Death Avoidance (To consider it Duty to make death avoided; With great powers comes great responsibility; This makes the Indifferent omnipotent actor in violation of the Minimal Benevolence Codex -- as well as the man who kills.)\n- **2**: No Extreme Suffering (This is Extreme. Not merely suffering. Suffering is simply a fact of reality and it is emotional morality. That we feel makes us want or not want oughts. To be against physical torture is because it is painful it is emotionally horrible and thus we ought it not happen. etc. An example of extreme suffering is the cartoonish medieval torture devices. It isn't most rape (what makes rape extreme suffering and what makes it not) and it isn't most violence. (This is MINIMAL. So you assert what other law you want below in whatever nesting. This is the proposed UBIQUITY LAW of the Planet.))\n- **3**: Somewhere Free (To be able to end a state of reality and choose another where one isn't kept down or worked against or contained. The choice of escape. To go free. To leave a ship and board another. Somewhere. Whatever that may be. Which depends on Crucible nesting structure of sovereignty wanting one where. Which worlds are open to you. And which are not. You can't force your presence upon others. Raw might. When the less potent leverage doesn't work.)\n\n(It is worth noting that merely doing MBC with Crucible Sovereignty willing to not preference the potential rapists or dangerous elements. Allows for reduction of killing, raping, extreme-violence and more by almost 100% in whatever zone a good wise harsh sovereign acts upon. And it is worth noting that by mere emergence of these systems of will-coalescence and will-disentanglement one gets a reduction in general conflict and unwanting opposition: which sequitorily makes violence and many other worse crime go way down -- as well as general happiness and sense of empowerment go way up. The plurality of The Crucible - the millions of places to try and live in or be part of - makes it possible to find the fit for any folk, familiy or face -- I mean entity/collective/individual)\n\nA potential Oceanic or larger scale (less restricted enforcement) may look something like the following:\nViolate or be a threat of violating MBC 123 = Physical deportation\nStay within MBC 123 = Allowed to remain (but others are empowered in ways to make you feel the weight with which they unwant you: will-economic topology being affected in quantity and quality by this.)\n\nIn Planetary or potentially some Worlds lands:\n- \"Anything goes EXCEPT MBC 123\"\n- Gray zone attacks are allowed within these bounds\n- But Discovery OS when collectively used in certain ways allows individuals to leverage collective will-manifesting and intelligence powers to route around them:\n  - Virtually (different information spaces)\n  - Business-wise (different economic paths)\n  - Spacetime (predictive avoidance)\n(Though one can imagine a setting where only trustless gossip will-fields are used and no one has any trust in anyone. Thus will-disentanglement becomes much much much harder if possible at all when faced with many willing to incur will-economic costs in will-against-will in actuality/spacetime/space instead of routing to will-economic efficiency of will-coalescence with emergent will-disentanglement)\n\n### The Devil's Test: When Law is Only MBC 123\n\n**The Uncomfortable Reality of Minimal Law:**\n\nIn Ocean-level sovereignties, law may be reduced to ONLY the Minimal Benevolence Codex:\n- **1**: Death Avoidance\n- **2**: No Extreme Suffering\n- **3**: Somewhere Free\n\nThis means many things we find abhorrent (like pedophilia) might be technically \"legal\" if they don't violate these three principles. This is \"The Devil's Law\" - testing whether freedom can survive its darkest implications.\n(For the reader: It is worth noting that sex with children occurs for extremely high percentages in the third world. It is of no use to pretend and wish a world that isn't there and not trying to find ways in which to express one's will to dominate others. In this case the dominating alignment is MBC at the largest scale (ubiquity law). Then it becomes whatever else at other scales you can coalesce others with. So, if you wish to fight pedo-erotics, then you will have to do it a World or Ocean level. Not planetary level. This is to reduce the maximally worst conditions of humanity. The broadest possible tent of leverage. 100 years ago The West married 9-year old brides. And you will fail in having a tent of leverage if you categorically ban things like sex-with-a-minor or whatever it may mean to you. So, MBC focuses on the fundamentals: No death (permanence), No EXTREME suffering (like dismembering skinning bone-breaking skin-tearing etc torture), The Exit Right (They can go free to a world that wants them or The Devil's Mercy of Planetary provision of space -- however isolated and insulated and disjoint that may be from everyone else) (Coincidentally... The Pedophilia of mine forces these rights to be granted children too. That is, the will and emotion; the intent and consent; It matters too, like that of a dear brother.))\n\n**Social Death Instead of Legal Death:**\n\nWhat happens to someone who does horrible things within MBC 123?\n\n```\nTrust Network Consequences:\n- Reputation scores subjective (individual basis but de facto on transitivity states of Trust Network(s)) craters to zero\n- Economic exile - no one trades with them; or if trade then the pricing is much higher (will-economics: Money isn't green. Good and Services aren't isolated products (ex nihilo with no cause nor context))\n- Social isolation - no community accepts them\n- Information blackout - can't find gatherings: Discovery becomes an isolated endeavour; alone to infer and intel what to infect - I mean intermingle/interact with.\n- BUT: Still protected from murder/torture/imprisonment: Planetary sought Ubiquity Law. (So you want to kill someone? Ritual of sending them out into outer space :P You get my point...)\n```\n\nThey become \"living ghosts\" - physically protected by law but socially dead by whoever wants them to be -- whatever worlds or percentage of the world that may be. (Note: Nested in physical space (Crucible Triad) and a person is banished; you vehemently disagree perhaps. Okay governance structure allows for plug and play movements into new space. Potentially forking (segmenting of the Triad into those who fall upon that line (Sovereign choice). Potentially Sharding (Settling of the same Triad also in new space). And certainly Aiddaemonic will-economic topological changes. Which has real manifesting properties))\n\n**How Communities Respond:**\n\nWithout legal prohibition, communities develop:\n- Warning systems (without violence)\n- Extraction protocols for victims; (This comes down to Horns ultimately; Or golden laurels with Horns. And sometimes mere will-economic leverage is sufficient. Say, end of food provisioning and any other thing within MBC (Intelligence and ineptitude often makes it within or without MBC))\n- Parallel economies excluding predators (or any persons one wishes to and can coherently with others leverage in act against; The Powerless in Leverage with others, always have the Devil's Mercy options: Somewhere free, somewhere sovereign, somewhere their will and way. Even if it means all alone. (Why do I call it Devil's? Because it is such amorality and to cooperate with and be buddies to the degree of claiming land for ANYONE. Anyone AT ALL. The Equality ideation on these lines granted to anyone.))\n- Protective architectures within MBC 123\n- Honeypot identification systems\n- Alternative path visibility for victims\n\n**The Market Creates Dark Territories:**\n\nSuch persons end up:\n- Finding only each other for community\n- Trading only among themselves\n- Building parallel survival systems\n- Creating zones others never enter\n- Existing but effectively exiled\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nThis extreme test reveals \"Polymorphic Crucible\"'s from this document viewed at the machine-implementation level which includes the daemon computer-mirror \"Aiddaemon\" - which has a potential machine-level implementation unit and enabler called Discovery OS - deepest principle: even facing the worst of humanity, the system maintains its core protections while using social/economic mechanisms for everything else. It asks: \"Can you maintain principles when facing what you hate most? Or will you find other ways?\"\n\nThe answer: Trust Networks, economic consequences, and social death handle what law doesn't. The system remains radically free while making evil economically and socially nonviable.\n\n---\n\n### The Innovation Theft Economy\n\nCurrent system enables theft at every level:\n- **Academic makes breakthrough** \u2192 Corporate giant \"independently discovers\" it\n- **Engineer creates innovation** \u2192 Company owns it, engineer gets nothing\n- **Startup develops technology** \u2192 Big Tech acquires and shelves it\n- **Innovator ideates novelty** \u2192 Surveillence society catches it and provides it part of a large AI service.

Will-Economic Blob Classes: Beyond Corporate Metrics {#blob-classes}\n\n### The Poverty of Corporate Metrics\n\nCorporate HR loves metrics because they're:\n- **Gameable**: \"Hit your KPIs\" regardless of real value\n- **Reductive**: Complex human values reduced to numbers\n- **Political**: What gets measured depends on who has power\n- **Static**: Same metrics even as world changes\n\n### Will-Economics: ALL Externalities Considered\n\n**Critical insight**: Will-economics is NOT just money. It includes:\n- Environmental impact\n- Social relationships  \n- Ethical alignment\n- Aesthetic preferences\n- Long-term consequences\n- Spiritual/philosophical alignment\n- Community effects\n- Health implications\n- Time and attention costs\n- Dignity and respect\n- ANY factor that matters to the daemon (human)\n\n### Blob Classes: Computational Feasibility\n\nHow do you compute with infinite dimensions of value?\n\n**Answer**: Blob Classes - learned approximations that capture patterns\n\n```\nThe Aiddaemon learns to approximate the daemon (human) by:\n- Observing choices over time\n- Learning nebulous but precise categories\n- Reducing infinite dimensions to tractable computation\n- Continuously improving approximation\n\nExample: \"Friend energy preservation manifold\"\n- Not reducible to simple metrics\n- Learned through observation\n- Includes timing, context, history, feeling\n- Computationally tractable through approximation\n```\n\n```\nCORPORATE METRIC: Customer Satisfaction Score (1-10)\n    \u2193 [Loses all nuance, gameable, meaningless]\n\nBLOB CLASS: \"Customer Delight Topology\"\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Morning grumpiness coefficient\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Surprise-joy gradient\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dignity preservation field\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Soul-alignment resonance\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Childhood-memory activation potential\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Future-nostalgia probability\n    \nCannot be reduced to a number, must be learned/felt\n```\n\n### Examples of Evolved Blob Classes\n\n**\"Friend Energy Preservation Manifold\"**\n- Not just \"social capital\" (corporate speak)\n- Includes: joke timing, shared silence comfort, crisis support potential, weird hour availability, food sharing protocols\n- Aiddaemon learns: routing through friend's server at 2\u00a2 more preserves this entire manifold\n\n**\"Dignity Maintenance Solution Space\"**\n- Not just \"user experience\" (corporate metric)\n- Includes: never/always making human feel stupid, preserving face in failures, suggesting without condescending, celebrating small wins authentically\n- Sub-aiddaemons evolve: interfaces that enhance human dignity\n\n**\"Soul-Alignment Gradient\"**\n- Not \"work-life balance\" (HR checkbox)\n- Includes: deep purpose resonance, creative flow states, meaningful impact feeling, legacy building sensation\n- System learns: which tasks feed the soul, which drain it\n\n### The Computational Challenge\n\nHR rejects this because:\n1. **Can't standardize it** - Each human's blob classes are unique (See aiddaemonic language bridge -- semantic approximations. (Imagine having understood what a word has in semantics to a person with all context\\* then able to generate 1000 sentences for another to understand much more precisely what is meant. Or quantitatively jump straight into the relation to other concepts or intent))\n2. **Can't manage it** - No human-readable-spreadsheet (without massive neologism innovations) can even remotely capture soul-alignment\n3. **Can't control it** - Emerges from individual will, not policy\n4. **Can't monetize it simply** - Requires understanding full externalities-beliefs; Subjective predictions and estimations of cause and effect; prior, current and post.\n\n### Blob Class Evolution\n\n```\nGENERATION 1: Binary satisfaction (happy/sad)\nGENERATION 10: Emotional spectrum recognition\nGENERATION 50: Contextual emotional landscapes\nGENERATION 200: Phenomenological topology mapping\nGENERATION 1000: Predictive soul-state navigation\n```\n\nThe system learns what can't be taught, measures what can't be metricked.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Information Flow Dynamics and Anonymous Will Layers {#information-dynamics}\n\n### Beyond Simple Gossip\n\nCorporate systems treat information as commodity.

It is important to understand this utility of having an Aiddaemon: To allow computers-speed discovery of matching other persons on the planet with deep mapping of one-self at that scale of real interaction. Nanosecond. Terahertz by parallelism throughput. It allows for discovering suitable pathways of action and actors to deal with; without spilling private data; but merely by having your mirror in digital space; then through Trust Network able to disclosure or divulge to actors thus believed to not make it transitive (keep secrets) and so on. (Normal human considerations of when to share. And also what information is kept by the other. Or revealed to the human or simply kept at the Aiddaemonic level. Which allows for mystery \"Our aiddaemons matched us. We want to explore it unbiased and see if we discover the same reasons why we match or not\")\n```\n\n**Layer 2: Anonymous Statistical Layer**\n```\nAiddaemons \u2192 Anonymous Aggregation \u2192 Will-Field\n\"17 unknown-reasons-plausibly-aligned-or-of-interest-to-intent-Y-of-yours-containing-anonymous entities seeking coffee in this area\"\n\nProperties:\n- Monero-style anonymous demand signaling (What normal markets do; untrustworhy&intentionally-deceptive advertisement becoming trustless advertisement automated for any (\\*will-)coalescence including normal producer-consumer markets) (\\* We center all acts upon human will.

Trust Maps are mostly a task that flows through the aiddaemonic networking and building maps by daemon<->aiddaemon communication as well as aiddaemon<->aiddaemon communication and inference: Trust Networks.\n```\n\n### Default Mode: Direct Aiddaemon Communication\n\n**The normal daily reality**: Most interactions aren't anonymous broadcasts but direct Aiddaemon-to-Aiddaemon negotiation at computational speed.\n\n```\nYour daily experience:\n\nMorning (Overly verbose example to bridge an old view of things to a more contemporary view of things):\nAiddaemon: \"I've coordinated with your team's Aiddaemons.

Anti-Consensus Mechanisms: Why Universal Adoption is Death {#anti-consensus}\n\n### The Consensus Trap\n\nCorporate/HR thinking: \"Everyone must adopt the same system\"\nResult: Lowest common denominator, innovation death\n\nNS Systems (including Discovery OS): \"Let a thousand systems bloom and compete\"\nResult: Evolutionary pressure, continuous innovation\n\n### The Power of System Competition\n\n**Critical insight**: Discovery OS does NOT require universal adoption. It's about opening up competition between systems. In fact, it is able to outcompete other systems because it is a meta-system that allows for system replacement or mutation.\n\n**Traditional monopoly**: \"Everyone must use our system\"\n- Lowest common denominator\n- Innovation stagnates\n- Extraction maximized\n- No exit option\n\n**Discovery OS approach**: \"Let thousand systems compete\"\n- Each sovereignty/owner/machine can run different variants\n- Natural selection determines winners\n- Continuous innovation pressure\n- Always exit options\n\n**Why competition matters:**\n1. **Prevents capture**: Can't corrupt all systems simultaneously\n2. **Drives innovation**: Better systems attract more users\n3. **Enables diversity**: Different systems for different values\n4. **Creates resilience**: Single failure doesn't break everything\n\n**The key**: It's not about creating THE system, but enabling system competition where:\n- Merit can't be stolen (occlusion layers)\n- Trust has consequences (PoP/PoU)\n- Exit is always possible and a somewhere will-economic landscape of possibilities diplomacy/systemic leverage; or otherwise Devilishly enabled. (sovereignty)\n- Evolution of systems and new pertubations never stops (natural selection)\n\nThis is why corporate structures fear it - not because it's one better system, but because it enables infinite better systems to emerge and compete.\n\n**Protocol Mutation Encouragement:**\n```\nREGION A: Evolves speed-optimized protocols\nREGION B: Evolves trust-maximizing protocols  \nREGION C: Evolves energy-efficient protocols\nREGION D: Evolves privacy-preserving protocols\n\nRESULT: Cross-pollination of innovations\n        Not homogenization\n```\n\n### Semantic Bridge Architecture\n\nDifferent systems speak different languages:\n\n```python\nclass SemanticBridge:\n    def translate_will(self, foreign_will, foreign_context):\n        # Map alien concepts to local blob classes\n        local_blobs = self.find_resonant_blobs(foreign_will)\n        \n        # Preserve meaning, not form\n        if foreign_context.values_speed:\n            return self.speed_preserving_translation(local_blobs)\n        elif foreign_context.values_trust:\n            return self.trust_preserving_translation(local_blobs)\n        \n        # Allow for untranslatable concepts\n        return WillPacket(\n            translatable=local_blobs,\n            mysteries=foreign_will.untranslatable_aspects,\n            confidence=self.translation_confidence\n        )\n```\n\n### Exit Rights as Fundamental\n\nUnlike corporate systems where leaving means losing everything:\n\n```\nDISCOVERY OS EXIT PROTOCOL:\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Export your evolved Aiddaemon\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Take your trust network relationships\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Keep your merit history\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Fork the entire system if desired\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Compete with original system\n\nCorporate: \"You can't take your reputation when you leave\"\nDiscovery: \"Your reputation IS you, it travels with you; In fact corporations are known for what they are: muddying of responsibility and actors: Cover for Agents.

COMPLIANCE ANTIBODIES\n   \"Legal/regulatory won't allow it\"\n   Counter: Route through friendly jurisdictions\n\n3. CONSENSUS ANTIBODIES\n   \"We need all stakeholders to agree\"\n   Counter: Build working system, let results speak\n\n4. METRIC ANTIBODIES\n   \"How do we measure success?\"\n   Counter: Success is will-fulfillment, not KPIs. Besides the \"we\" is only a \"we\" when viewed shallowly. Let's do our \"I\" and see how and when it coalesce; Let us at least not deceive ourselves, \"I\" substituted with a faux \"we\" that sees only a few points of agreement or desired direction or avoidance of something.\n\n5. FAIRNESS ANTIBODIES\n   \"This advantages some over others\"\n   Counter: Merit-based advantage is justice\n\n6.

Human will is antithetical and pollution to the codified direction set out upon.\n   - Discovery OS: Each human is sovereign with unique will\n\n2. **Process Over Results**: HR loves process regardless of outcomes\n   - Discovery OS: Evolution keeps only what works; process is efficiency discovery; to search for that silly reduced optimized hardwiring that makes it grotesquely efficient or else prophetically attuned\n\n3. **Conflict Avoidance**: HR minimizes conflict through policy\n   - Discovery OS: Competitive evolution requires conflict; The Spice of Life with will-economic costs.\n\n4. **Standardization**: HR wants everyone following same rules\n   - Discovery OS: Each sovereignty makes its own rules; The Will to Will. One's Very Own Will. Oxymoronically too, but then in full comprehension of Willing another Will in some aspect.\n\n5. **Protection from Liability**: HR exists to protect company from employees\n   - Discovery OS: Alignment makes protection unnecessary; companies becomes the intuitive semantic of it: To share company with each other in act, space and time.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Prophet Markets and Negative Latency Economy {#prophet-markets}\n\n### Beyond Prediction Markets\n\nCorporate prediction markets: Bet on what will happen\nProphet markets: Create what should happen\n\n```\nTRADITIONAL MARKET:\n\"Will the project finish on time?\" \u2192 Bet yes/no\n\nPROPHET MARKET:\n\"Human will want coffee at 7:43 AM\" \u2192 Pre-brew at 7:41\n\"Human will need comfort after hard meeting\" \u2192 Pre-warm cozy space\n\"Human will have brilliant idea in shower\" \u2192 Pre-load note-taking\n\"Prediction of these .. ... ... ... then supply ... ... ... to enable .. ... ... towards ... ... \"\n```\n\n### The Negative Latency Stack\n\n```\nLEVEL 4: FULFILL BEFORE CONSCIOUS\nHuman hasn't yet realized they want it\nSystem already providing it\nExample: Path home optimized with many overlapping tasks dependent on many other persons and their choices all before the humans decides to leave.

(Their Aiddaemonic J\u00f6rd View also provides this prediction as a potential choice; making it much more likely the prediction will come true by human choices and will when the time comes to make the choices.))\n- Synchronicities increase\n- \"Luck\" improves dramatically. Will-coalescence. I wanted it to happen. I broadcasted along my trust beliefs/map. And it simply did. I had done so with 100 things about me and my views and will; and suddenly they simply started happening in holistic manner that totally aligned with each other. Coherence of my will coming together with other will and away from oppositional will in actuality.\n\n### Corporate Prophet Blindness\n\nCorporations can't do prophet markets because:\n\n1. **Quarterly Thinking**: Hard to invest in negative latency; oppositional nonconsentual information leaks or observations used to predict markets alone and with weak intelligence gathering and untrustworthy sourcing or unknown trustworhiness.\n2. **Metrics Obsession**: Often hard to measure prevented latency; This is simply a side-effect of measuring will-fulfilling improvements. Which is often and ultimately assessed by the individual in their holistic view of things with whatever perspectives or maps they want to use.\n3. **Risk Aversion**: Prophet behavior requires speculation without Tinker Bell convergence of manifestation.\n4. **Committee Speed**: By committee decision, moment passed; Not even Human-scale responsiveness; but often tree-like ent-like weeks, months or years of deliberation to settle upon an action.\n5. **Customer Distance**: Don't know individual will deeply enough; Because they don't allow it THEIR OWN system. But instead desires to make it their system that the consumer then \"gets as a service\"; Which obviously makes them unwilling to allow for it to know them well. Too well. Whereas, when you flip it, and make it their system, then it better and better the better it mirrors or knows the master of it.\nAnd how to do this, is opening up as much as possible for picking exactly which parts to trust PoP Persons and their slave-substrates with.\nOr allow for efficient small models with good functionality for the most private parts to run on their own \"cold-stored\" or body-tied machinery with trust-chain productions exactly to the degree they want it. And such things.\n\n---\n\n## 10.

The systems are at every node \"preprogrammed to specific expected interconnectedness and functioning\".\n2. **Change Aversion**: Updates require committees per mutation-try; Not even the humans responsible for particular online systems are free to do updates as they best see fit.\n3. **Central Planning**: Evolution is organic\n4. **Metrics Focus**: We don't want \"The Measure\" evolutionary fitness; As it is as variant as human subjectivity. One way to view it is \"What is Beautiful (With all Eternity of constraint) to a person is fit\". Another is to say, what is (eternally) will-economic.\n5. **Control Need**: Evolution means letting go details and micromanagement; of rules and law; of proscribed oughts and behaviour or ways of functioning. To focus on discovery and then making the large choices of will-alignment of which variants.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Trust Network Topology and Dynamics {#trust-topology}\n\n### Trust as Living Graph, Not Hierarchy\n\nCorporate assumption: Trust follows org charts\nReality: Trust follows actual experience and relationships\n\n### Trust Networks Are Inference Engines\n\n**Not rigid groups but living relationship graphs:**\n```\nYou \u2192 [0.9 trust\\*] \u2192 Alice \u2192 [0.8 trust] \u2192 Bob\n  \u2193                     \u2193\n[0.7 trust]       [0.95 trust]  \n  \u2193                     \u2193\nCarol                David\n\nYou can INFER:\n- Bob likely trustworthy (via Alice trust-transitivity on Bob in relation to you)\n- David very likely trustworthy (via Alice's high trust)\n- Different paths give different confidence\n```\n\n### The Two Functions of Trust Networks\n\n**1. Discovery Function: Building Your Trust Map**\n\nIt is an arduous task of mapping truth about enemy-friend gradience upon you and others or persons; then inferring the degree of authenticity, honesty, trustworthiness and keeping an accord/agreement, a word, a gesture, a handshake.\nBut, it can be done sometimes with a lot of human work and sometimes in more automatic fashion, or Trust of Trust maps.\n\nHowever, there exists nodes/actors of Trust that is orthogonal to variables of \"who\". Or collections or sets of \"who\"'s.\nThese can be regarded in the following terms.\n\nThis is about **trustworthiness** and **trust-of-trust** allowing inference:\n\n```\nExample: \"This person has outstanding character and never \n         betrayed anyone. I trust to tell me such things\"\n         \u2192 I let transitivity of trust flow to them constrained by their ability to discern and discriminatively assess others in terms of Trust.\n         \u2192 They enter my trust map as a part of my otherwise more-personal-trustworthiness trust network -- but crucially adjusted for what they don't know about my trust limits and borders; as do any node in my trust network, they are inferential or transitivity nodes of intelligence (foundation of facts or intelligence), but ultimately only that: building blocks for me and my systems (Aiddaemon for most) to make my own map upon the Trust Atlas view of my Trust Network.\n```\n\nDiscovery helps you infer most nodes in your personal Trust Map from your Trust Network's collective knowledge. It's about WHO to potentially trust based on their general trustworthiness.\n\n**2. Operational Function: Task-Specific Trust**\n\nThis is about **domain-specific reliability**:\n\n```\nExample: \"For this particular coding task, how much do I trust \n         they will deliver quality work without deception?\"\n         \nThis may be completely separate from their general trustworthiness.\nYou might not trust their trust map at all, but trust them \ncompletely for this specific business interaction.\n```\n\nOperational trust is contextual - someone might be terrible at personal relationships but excellent at delivering code. These are different trust dimensions.\n\n### Why This Distinction Matters\n\nCorporate systems conflate all trust into \"reputation scores\"; that they then wish to claim objective/universal. Discovery OS recognizes:\n- Someone can be trustworthy (high Discovery trust) but incompetent at your specific need\n- Someone can be excellent at a specific task (high Operational trust) but not someone whose judgment you trust\n- Trust transitivity works differently for each function and relation (Combinatorial explosive space; Therefore the \"existence of Trustworthiness orthogonal to persons\" is an extremely valuable PoP virtue. The lack of Taqiya in a person. The anti-old-car-salesman. The stupidly true to his word virtuous person. The Deontological fool becomes hyper-treasure in terms of foundation of enabling human interaction in intelligent manner.)\n\n### Trust Isn't Transitive - It's Contextual\n\n**The Brother Paradox:**\n```\nYou \u2192 Best Friend: Trust = DNN state and weight connections. (But let's for arguments sake 0.9 1d projection)\nBest Friend \u2192 His Brother: Trust = some deepter DNN state and weight connections. (But let's say for arguments sake 0.95 1d projection)\nYou \u2192 Friend's Brother: Trust = some deeper DNN state and weight connections. (But let's say for arguments sake 0.02 1d projection)\n\nWhy? Context matters:\n- You trust friend's general judgement\n- Your friend trust his brother.\n- But the reasons or depths of trust. The causality of trust nebulae is orthogonal to each other. There is no projective transitivity left.\n- Only by relaying a task through the brother does Trust become transitive with greater magnitude. (Trustworthiness transitivity see examples above)\n```\n\n### Multi-Dimensional Trust\n\nTrust isn't scalar - it's multi-dimensional:\n```\nTrust_tensor_head = {\n  delivery_reliability: 0.95,\n  privacy_respect: 0.80,\n  quality_consistency: 0.90,\n  innovation_capability: 0.75,\n  emergency_response: 0.99,\n  price_fairness: 0.85,\n  communication_clarity: 0.88,\n  boundary_respect: 0.92\n}\n```\n\n### Why Outstanding Character Wins\n\nIn Trust Networks, the person who:\n- Keeps their word consistently\n- Helps without calculating immediate return\n- Judges others fairly; Or perhaps deals with others in impartial terms; Even indifference becomes valuable. \"To have given up on cheering for anyone or working against anyone\" -- The Amorality Monster. Though again, such impartiality or indifference/amorality, can of course be valuable in Trust, but negative in terms of wanting to deal with the person in many other domains. Say, transitivity of power or wealth or whatever else. Or merely them willing to deal with any other - no matter what demonic devils they may be. It is an balancing act of being impartial on Trust -- keeping the word \"Never Lying. Always keeping a promise or an oath\" -- But not necessarily in other dealings of life.\n- Shares knowledge much more freely; due to the trust-integrity of the information. To keep a secret. To not have loose lips. The Ship of Many that could be sunk, but doesn't, because of high degree of Trustworthiness and outstanding character: Virtue where it matters the most; The Foundation of all other Virtues.\n- Takes responsibility for failures; Not to become collective-sycophantic taking of blame and responsibility. Which many such networks easily devolve into. But for higher order or better networks: Truth. Authentic Assessment. For better or worse.\n\nBecomes a **trust network hub** with exponential advantages:\n- More opportunities flow to them; Also Opportunity discovery depend upon information and intelligence which is to say facts and computation on their interweaving.\n- Better information reaches them first; Much much much more information is willingly divulged to such persons; Perhaps with the trust that they not even look ever with any human eyes. Nor ever divulge more than intented. Instant Aiddaemonic adjustments. Etc.\n- Collaborative possibilities explode in numeracy and density of complementary and quality. And as \"virtual potentials to choose from\".\n- Will-economic advantages compound\n \n### The Character Advantage Is Mathematical, Not Moral\n\n**In Corporate World:**\n```\nSnake Speaker Path:\n- Short-term: Political wins through deception\n- Medium-term: Some people catch on, but can hide in bureaucracy  \n- Long-term: Lateral moves between companies, reputation doesn't follow\n- Result: Mediocre success with high stress but sustainable\n\nCharacter Person Path:\n- Short-term: Slower progress, often exploited\n- Medium-term: Trusted by those who matter, but limited by corporate ceiling\n- Long-term: Maybe becomes \"respected veteran\" with modest success\n- Result: Exploited by system that rewards politics over merit\n```\n\n**In Trust Network World:**\n```\nSnake Speaker Path:\n- Short-term: Quick gains through deception\n- Medium-term: Trust scores plummet across network\n- Long-term: Permanently excluded from opportunities\n- Result: Exponential decline to poverty of access\n\nCharacter Person Path:  \n- Short-term: Slow trust building\n- Medium-term: Compound reputation growth\n- Long-term: Exponential opportunity access\n- Result: Becomes high-value trust network hub\n```\n\n**The Mathematics:**\n\nIn a system with:\n- Perfect memory (blockchain/trust networks)\n- Reputation consequences (PoU confirmations)\n- Network effects (trust propagation)\n- Compound returns (trust builds on trust; everything else fundamentally is made efficient by trust (As an example: Consider mutual exclusive space of orbit; We can only have so-many satelites or occupancy of it. If trust was had by all in one actor. Then we could have one coherent NS system functioning there. If trust is segmented, then to have satelite utility one needs to trust the relay into or use of them (say cooling is easy there and energy generation can be made extra-planetary energy (orbit-dyson-semi-spheres (unfold large solar surfaces upon exiting solar obstruction towards planet: Allows for massive scale solar harvesting at orbit technology levels))), but there will have to be many disjoint trust-network providers all operating in the zero-sum space and coordination hazards between them. (Say, one accident allows for the dispersal of debris that can cause a cascade of catastrophe) This is an example of not only the immediate inefficiencies (non-optimal utilization of substrate and having to redundantly provide to cover potential spiking within trust-networks etc) but also the catastrophic outlook and ability to prevent them from happening or dealing with them should they occur. Try playing starcraft 2 archon mode and discover the annoying condition of coordinating different will in real-time tense problem solving and zero-sum constraints. Anyway. This is an example of how Trust enables efficiency. There are so many angles upon why Trust does that. Take the Discovery OS version: Computational overhead, encryption and trustless blockchain unnecessary. Or the NSS Whitepaper version: Allows for mutators of substrate to let their merit shine with greater intelligence and potential copying of it.))\n\nThe equation is simple:\n```\nConsistent trustworthiness = Compound growth\nDeception = Catastrophic plummeting decline\n\nOver time:\nTrustworthy person: 1.01^365 = 37.8x return\nDeceptive person: 0.99^365 = 0.03x return\n```\n\n**It's not about being \"good\"** - it's about the mathematical reality that in a system with perfect memory and real consequences, trustworthiness becomes the highest ROI strategy available.\n\nCharacter wins not because of morality, but because of math. **Policy Trust**: Trust established by rules\n   - Reality: Trust emerges from experience\n\n4. **Transitive Trust**: Simple multiplication\n   - Reality: Non-Euclidean trust geometry\n\n---\n\n## 12. Some notes on Ownership, Control and Influence {#own-control-influence}\n\nA word on Ownership. The idea that others should consider an object invioably yours. Unquestionably. Unconditionally. Yours.\nThat is the supposed idea of it. It is thus obvious that it is, entirely imaginary and a Golden Laurel of Power. Who actually owns it (pwn) are the ones who control it and they are the ones wearing The Horns of the \"it\" they \"{p/o}wn\".\n\n### Ownership != Control != Influence\n\nThe ones controlling the substrate are rarely the supposed owners. \nTheir control is limited to a financial reward of their \"investment\" and a potential voting right of changing who would be (em/de)ployed to control it.\nAnd those that influence it, are rarely named, if at all. Like, who are influentially connected to the ones (em/de)ployed in controlling it.\n\nCorporate view: You never own real objects, instead an abstraction owns it, to which you have a stake or percentage ownership. This makes it infeasible to fission the \"it\" and must therefore refer to abstractions of control and coordination. Making it diseased with the same ailment as governments.\nDiscovery OS: Ownership is binary. You either Own it. Or you don't. There is no middle ground. This is fundamentally the doctrine of accountability and responsibility.

Also, ignoring the substrate of governance in which they are (em/de)ployed -- and what that means in terms of lawful ownership and seizing of control.\n   - Reality: Influence matters more than papers; Positioning unnamed or lawful switch pullers.\n\n2. **Static Ownership**: Fixed at purchase from ploy making employers of persons capable of producing a product or object to own.\n   - Reality: Ownership is will-economic equilibrium question of when to transition and which other third parties accept the transfer. (Say, current situation of Silicon Valley being owned lawfully by a few actors then sold to enemies of the american people, may make them disagree that the transfer of ownership is valid or acceptable terms. Therefore, they may wish to refuse it. Or in general that intent or view or will may be had at any perception of ownership. These systems make them visible and able to be acted upon with leverage. Including such things as commanding real Horns with the Laurel support to seize it all. Even though the current Golden Laurel system refuses it (What is hardwired in law and the agents who occupy key positions in the decentralization of power into the hands of shadow (supposedly) 'gray men of impartiality' (Which they most certainly are not; often they are very partisan or foreign hostile agents; Advice for reader: Reread the previous ownership, control and influence sections.))) \n\n3. **Central Registry**: Database tracks ownership; Disputes are central commanded by diffuse agency and responsibility and allegiances. Crucible makes it all very visible and pluralistic therefrom. Subjective views of ownership. Pwnership is proof. And Control is what it is.\n   - Reality: Ownership emergent from individual views and their Trust Networks. \n\n4. **Transfer Protocol**: Complex legal process; Immense overhead in any dispute between supposed \"owners of the abstraction\" when dealing with anything concrete of reality. Any fission is massively expensive or disentanglement so too. It allows for massive cover of deceit and extraction of \"what is owned\" by the controllers of it.\n   - Reality: Current system is almost everywhere a fluid of influence.

And potentially depths of how that generally align with your will/daemon.\nThis allows for a much broader economic view or pricing than mere green/money.\nIt allows for intelligence and will-manifestation without knowing a thing about the owner or profitters or controllers as persons. Though having had your machine (Aiddaemon-equivalent-class-automation-systems) do that work for you.\n\n\n### The Spectator Economy\n\nIn Discovery OS, spectators aren't passive consumers but active participants, every purchase or consumption has real general will-manifesting properties; real will-economic consequences; The question is WHO gets the profit or power from it (You can do this by protocol as well. NSS again. \"They have to provide so and so much to this or that\". But SOME would presumably go to a WHO - and we should wish it so (human agency and supremacy. Not system or machine as master) - then who that WHO is matters profoundly though currently totally transparent landscape and totally untameable to a person to comprehend or navigate within):\n\n```python\nclass SpectatorValue:\n    def proof_of_person(self, person, automatic_pseudonyms_weave_strengthening):\n        ...\n\n    def witness_performance(self, performer, performance):\n        # Spectator presence regenerates performer; \"Ranking observations/opinions\".

The best is an inkling of who owns publically traded companies and the top responsibility of control actors like CEO/CTO/COO etc.\n\n**Trust Network Reality**: Information Opaqueness (Because the Abstractions are transparent)\n- Real experiences shared; the evolving information gathering and collective intelligence networks/systems that strongly can understand and learn bad actors.\n- Quality variations mapped\n- Negative experiences weighted by trust including potential willingness to incur will-economic costs upon the bad actors with whatever leverage one can and transitivity of one's network. (Which includes the governance substitute: Crucible Triadic Sovereignty. Banishment from space being the usual consequence. Restriction of world one is welcome in.)\n- Alternatives discovered through network\n\n### The Emergence of True Price Discovery\n\n**Corporate \"Market Price\"**: Edge transactions (Highest bid buyer and lowest bid seller meeting at volume variance of supply and demand)\n- Where desperate seller meets desperate buyer\n- Manipulated by large actors (To make them \"believe\" it is now that value due to high actor manipulating it consistently over time \"making it the new normal\". It only takes this \"edge\" or \"meeting of buyers and sellers\" to fly into the moon or sun like Icarus.)\n- Hidden by intermediaries\n- Disconnected from value\n\n**Trust Network Value**: Gradient of subjective values\n- Each person values differently; and can't gather information on how the one's values are affected: The cost landscape is mostly transparent/invisible.\n- Trust relationships affect pricing; not only in terms of limits in understanding will-coalescence-landscape or will-economic topology between the two; and whether information divulging is worth much when trust is what it is. But also in terms of overhead of fulfilling a utility between the two.\n- Reputation creates premium/discount; on top of trust, reputation can allow for willingness to do unfair pricing against oneself with the same justification as taxes are levied now. Laurel kind of implicit voluntary tax-collecting. This is Beyond will-coalescence-landscape/will-economic-topology that is the replacement of transaction equilibrium or pricing or 1-d money as nearly the only evaluation of transaction or not. (These systems allows for total abandonment of money if one wishes: Raw Will-Coalescence and Manifestation upon earth together towards least-cost will-economic coalescence; which implies constraints to greed and implies making space and implies will-disentanglement and segmentation of will-mutually-exclusiveness that can not be fixed by abundance).\n- Value connected to actual utility not only in task-isolation but holistic will-economic viewpoint. Will-value.\n\n### Market Responsiveness at Light Speed\n\n**Corporate**: Quarterly planning cycles\n- Six months to recognize trend\n- Year to develop response\n- Another year to market\n- Usually miss the moment\n\n**Discovery OS**: Real-time adaptation; interdaemonic communication and transactions or will-coalescence-economic-equilibrium at computer-advantaged domains; as well as instantaneously command of all subaiddaemonic wrapped substrated to transforms upon the whim of human will. (Bask in the POWER! xD)\n- Pattern emerges in trust network\n- Providers immediately see demand\n- Solutions developed collaboratively\n- Market satisfied while still hot\n\n### Example: The Coffee Shop Revolution\n\n**Corporate Starbucks Approach:**\n- Market research says \"people want third place\"\n- Standardize experience globally\n- Optimize for efficiency\n- Wonder why local shops win\n\n**Trust Network Coffee Reality:**\n- Each shop emerges from local PoP; Perhaps they merely \"use building substrate by NSS protocol\" or perhaps they employ another daemon+aiddaemon at different parts in their organization. Such as software or machinery or other things to facilitate their functioning.\n- Regulars' presence shapes atmosphere\n- Barista can know your weird order; or she can make it without even knowing a thing and perhaps never noticing herself. Perhaps she simply allows her Aiddaemon to guide her actions for maximum will-economic profit in that task-solving situation -- while not knowing a thing about you or your weird orders -- perhaps not knowing is exactly what allows will-economic-equilibrium-efficiency and thus she actively assures she doesn't notice much about what she is doing or who it is for (Perhaps assisted by subaiddaemons/machinery she is able to do that).\n- Community self-organizes events\n- Shop evolves with neighborhood\n- Collective intelligence optimizes for actual desires\n\n### Why This Destroys Corporate Planning\n\nCorporate planning assumes:\n1. Markets can be researched abstractly; often by questionaire low-d space and statistics from it (conflation of causes).\n2. Averages represent anyone. Even though usually it represents very few persons well in any strong theory; Worse so: In reality no-one. Mean and Median and Mode in low or worse high-dimensional space (sparsity means Mean less Medianic and Modean). (This is the same pattern or lesson concerning \"democracy\" in The Crucible or Routing/Voting/\u00acAnarchy Systems of many \u2663 is \u2666 (See Blob Classes Discovery section in (Heidegger Perspective) Polymorphic Crucible Document: it is about the \"beyond astronomical dimensions\" needed to consider \"all-things-considered\" of will in space and time and combinatorial interaction and state of being). The Destiny of Humanity Where NO ONE gets what they want anywhere. But they can be happy they managed to \"compromise\" getting what they wanted and being happily entangled in chaotic manner that ensures the great thwarting of even that which was agreed upon in compromisational systems. These documents provide the alternative answer: Be Honest About Your Will And See It Manifest As Best You Can with Real Constraints to the consequences of willing that which is mutually exclusive as opposed to the approximations or trade-offs that provide non-mutually-exclusive or simultaneous/concurrent/parallel/branched/eventual-mutual-manifestation etc. TLDR; Let Your Will Stand Alone and Unpollutedly Impact, Interact and Impose (If you do this, then overall good happens in context of this system))\n3. Standardization equals efficiency (standardization or law or rules enables whatever is dynamically or freely \"bad\" to be leveled to some simpletonic control)\n4. Control creates value (Control allows for easier consistency in value (at least in the short term (Inability to release control upon convergence of catastrophe usually results in keep the drive lock on while approaching the ledge of the cliff: Lemming manufacturing by binding to \u2666 systems. Or difficulty in abandoning a captain \u2663 and his ship \u2666; or even with abandoning but his ship being too large and with too much leverage.)))\n\nDiscovery OS proves:\n1. Markets emerge from real interaction; The mode of markets is currently a multiple-choice with few opportunities to substitute the supplier chain or manufacture new demand (attention and advertisement industries). The future \"multimarket\" allows for subjective pricing of holistic impact of transaction. Thus the markets emerge from the PoP PoU/Performance/LLL-gaming Trust Networks interaction foundation. As well as Aiddaemon replacing attention and advertisement actors; to align what is presented as choices in life with the daemon as if the person was able to use beyond-current-level-intelligence-services to gather information about all externalities or impact of potential choices in life viewed any scale and valuation of the person. Will, Value and Emotion economics.\n2. Everyone is unique, patterns emerge: convergence and diverge. Meta-learning stays to allow for better and better pathfinding or actualization.\n3. Evolution beats standardization; Because it is the dynamic learning phase with incorporated human plurality of valuation or what matters or what ought to matter and so on.\n4. Freedom given sufficient intelligence systems allows for it to entail the creation of massive positive-sum value creation.\n\nThe corporate model literally cannot compete with:\n- Zero-overhead trust verification\n- Real-time multimarket intelligence\n- Ungameable reputation systems\n- Collective learning networks with only chosen levels of privacy threats (all the way down to monero-style gossip telling and potentially no trusted learning)\n- Emergent optimization real-time; What works in a moment (obviously with much better understanding of substrate rewriting costs and empowered capacity to (Like the One Human Will -> Aiddaemon -> Subaiddaemon -> Restructuring)).\n\n---\n\n## 14. Why HR Failed: A Point-by-Point Destruction {#hr-destruction}\n\n### Their Core Misunderstandings\n\n**1. \"We need stakeholder alignment\"**\n- HR View: Everyone must agree before action; and if they don't domination of supposed \"shared\" or \"stake owners\" by the winning majority. (Their ownership or control proved void: Like in \"democracy\"; daemocracy (Triads) makes this control and its voidness of substrate subjects visible in that the Triads have a superject of the physical space and thus ultimately the hardwiring therein (In similar fashion to how nubulous Governments current hold that power))\n- Reality: Individual sovereignty acts, others adapt or compete; And all is submitted to the only authority they can confer to given their ultimate trustlessness assumption of persons: Systems and Institutions (proclamations and rulebooks for the dominators who are then justfied as dominators by having been employed, selected, chosen, voted in etc.)\n- Result: HR creates paralysis, Discovery OS creates evolution.

(One hint or advice can perhaps be levied: If the \"committee\" or institution/organization is unable to manage reality at a catastrophic level. Then doing a segmentation of physical space and attempting the deployment of proposed systems seems reasonable: As they unleash human potential and positions Human Will as the Master of Machine; While providing even the Animals Philia sufficient for their Animus to be incorporated as part of the will-coalescence dynamics; Similar emergent reality of their constraints and The Devil's Mercy; Question is: How to \"allow an animal exit rights; somewhere free; death avoidance; no extreme suffering\" \\\\// Equality in Sovereignty even? \"It does not want to.

(The example of animal longevity ever minimized to provide economic or co2 optimization are examples))\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The System They Can't Stop\n\nDiscovery OS represents everything corporate structures fear because it solves fundamental problems they depend on:\n\n### The Complete Solution Architecture\n\n**Trust Networks** replace hierarchies by enabling:\n- Discovery: Learning who to trust through trust-of-trust inference (Base of all Intelligence cooperation or work. To learn efficiently requires trust. (Unless you have intelligence-supremacy-over-all-actors-at-once which is \"unlikely\"))\n- Operations: Direct task-specific reliability without oversight (In some cases trust transitivity by strategic high-trust task-concurrency-solving-or-checking-verifiers (The \"Trust Stamp\" by Third Party Intelligent Oversight))\n- 90%+ overhead elimination through trust instead of surveillance and bureaucracy and authoritative title/positions/employments/schoolings: To Stand Naked at your STATE and INTERRELATION is scary for well-positioned persons and thus these documents would be fought by anyone with imposter syndromes while unwilling to fall into world-will.\n\n**PoP/PoU** creates ungameable value verification through:\n- Natural selection gaming that maintains human presence requirement\n- Real persons staking reputation on actual utility delivery and valuation of delivery\n- Strata accumulation through witnessed performance useful for Trust Networks; (Similar to block mining for trustless systems: PoPs (Proof of Person/Performance(PoU)/Presence))\n- Mathematical advantage for predictive utility; which is unfortunate if persons believe it important to pretend to be; instead of being honestly. It is the latter that matters to depths of consistency. Performance of being; Not performative display of persona.\n\n**Will-Economics** captures ALL value dimensions through:\n- Blob classes that approximate quantitative finite scope of human values/will within a person-potential infinite scope. (Finds the right weighings and features in massively dynamic or remembering to forget manner; including feature spaces: This allows for self-hosting to be a reality. Despite massively intelligent base-learning projected onto self-hosting dynamic-feature-space reinforcement learning Aiddaemon system. (This is a lot easier with for any one there exists at least one high-leverage actor/person trusted who can help project low-feature-space Aiddaemons onto their self-hosting devices of the future that are SOLID++ (Of course, one can forego having self-hosting by having trusted providers of one's Aiddaemon. But default is to make it self-hosted to allow for maximal will-empowerment by Trust airtight systems where information collected never ever COULD leave the device (New Hardwiring of Aiddaemon by manufacturing of new cold-store self-hosting device))))\n- Computational feasibility without losing nuance; by genetic hardwiring all the way down. (Even from Aiddaemon distribution levels as described above (Let's say you own lots of machines: Then obviously you don't settle for low-feature-space projected Aiddaemon self-hosted; but instead as expensive as you can afford self-hosting or intermediary Trusted providers or potentially Trustless attempts at doing the same (Good Luck xD I am not joking Trust is (economic-)efficiency gold)))\n- Every externality considered convergently with interactive time, not just money, in fact one can reduce money to \"banana coins\" that which is orthogonal to your will: Then you trade in money.\n- True alignment with human will (daemon)\n\n**Direct Aiddaemon Communication** enables:\n- Pre-negotiated optimization at computational speed\n- AI prompting human with solutions, not questions: Alignment when it matters; Latent Learning (easily enabled by above stuff and Live Life Locally (LLL) games; simply living is wealth creation. Will seeking. Willing your Will. Is economic creation. Real will-coalescing intelligence (In the most world-will and individual and Trust Network controllable manner you can imagine (Billion times better than current system (N\\A better than current system))) and foundation provisioning.)\n- Progressive disclosure with established connections\n- 90% of interactions streamlined automatically\n\n**Information Layers** provide both:\n- Attributed communication with trust consequences\n- Anonymous statistical layers for safe exploration\n- Multaiddaemon coordination for collective defense\n- Market-like discovery without surveillance\n\n**Competitive Evolution** ensures:\n- No single system to capture or corrupt; NSS Protocols deal with competition dynamics somewhat; even competitions with what was or could be; without having an is. Letting it overtake and be immediate-performer in exponentially growing feedback dynamic fashion. (Again, I understand safety concerns; These systems if done right are faaaaar more safe. But I understand it. So, therefore: Segmentation. To allow it happening somewhere. The MetaCrucible of The PolyMorphic Crucible. Control of Non-Crucible World. Or Old World with New World. So, \"founding of durotar\" or the exodus into territory currently deemed incredibly bad utilized or not utilized at all. We shall see how rigid Old World Systems deal with it. Or if it has to be eaten from within and have revolution happen to it; then allow it to stay by the degree of stubborn or control-world world-will)\n- Continuous innovation through selection pressure\n- Exit options always available\n- Merit protected through occlusion layers and lumen perspectives and low-lumen philosophies.\n\n### Why They Can't Stop It\n\nWhen people experience:\n- 90% reduction in transaction costs\n- Pre-solved coordination at computational speed\n- Merit accumulation without theft\n- True will-alignment instead of metrics\n- Character mathematically rewarded\n- Protection from hostile actors\n- Infrastructure that evolves to serve them\n(Thank you AI for doing these recollection things. I have added stuff but can't recollect them into this recollection)\n\nWhy would they ever go back to:\n- Corporate hierarchies and surveillance; Chaos Control and total invisible power structures and obfuscated domination and accountability/responsibility with no recourse other than broken expert system rulebooks like Law.\n- Metric gaming and politics\n- Theft of innovation and merit\n- Snake speakers winning over character\n- Fixed infrastructure that doesn't adapt\n- Vulnerability to hostile actors\n\n### The Mathematical Reality\n\nThis isn't ideological - it's mathematical:\n- Trust networks are vastly more efficient in many domains; and enable qualitatively different intelligence.\n- Character compounds while deception collapses\n- Evolution beats planning every time; because evolution includes planning if allowed a feedback dynamic growth rate sufficient to eat up the catastrophy and solution available for projection into reality. In case that isn't feasible: Then Planning beats evolution; But only insofar it in fact more intelligent than the rest of the variants in dealing with what isn't able to have feedback effects: The Eternal Truths of the Matter. (Acute and short-term chronic effects can have feedback. That which requires astronomical time or potentials can't be incorporated into evolution directly: Only through implicit learning or having had it useful or unlikely happenstance serendipity of being aligned with Eternal Truths.. These \"Vastly Superior Intelligence\" viewpoints are dealt with in Protocol Design mostly. (See NSS Whitepaper) (You can think of it as forethought convergence at edge considerations of evolutionary dynamics and things like enabling sufficient force of proper responses to grow rapidly enough and so on.))\n- Will-alignment beats metric optimization; because the metric-space chosen for objective analysis is always a wrong cut in relation to individual will. And almost always too low-dimensional.\n- Competition beats monopoly; NSS Whitepaper deals with Monopoly by protocol of growth of that which is more will-economic and Trust Network interactive relationships. \"Islands of Progress\".\n\n### The Choice Is Made\n\nNot through force. Not through revolution. Not through convincing.\n\nBut through the simple reality that when people can choose between:\n- A system that extracts from them\n- A system that evolves to serve them\n\nThe choice makes itself.\n\n**The future emerges from individual sovereignty, trust networks delivering real value through witnessed performance, and infrastructure that evolves to fulfill human will.**\n\nThe Polymorphic Crucible: Including Machine Instantiation/implementation substrate for subaiddamonic wrapping (Discovery OS) isn't a proposal or possibility.\n\nIt's the mathematical inevitability of what happens when human sovereignty meets computational capability in a system that understands depths of \"merit\" and enables competition.\n\nAnd that terrifies HR more than anything else.\n\nBecause in that future, they're not just obsolete.\n\nThey're unthinkable. \n\nThe Persons previously of HR becomes Human Resource workers where they instead find work by LLL games, Trust Networking and PoPs or Crucible style spatial-segmented governance."}, {"path": "system share/foundations/26. crucible-discovery-synthesis.md", "title": "26. crucible-discovery-synthesis.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# The Unified Framework: Crucible, Discovery OS, and NSS as Civilizational Evolution Architecture\n## A Synthetic Integration of Voluntary Competition, Will Manifestation, and Natural Selection\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n1.

Core Synthesis: The Three Pillars Working Together {#core-synthesis}\n\n> **[HR Comment - Sarah from Talent Management]**: \"This seems to lack proper governance structures. How do we ensure compliance and standardization across implementations? We need clear reporting lines and accountability frameworks.\" \n\nThe three frameworks form a complete civilizational operating system that is **fundamentally incompatible with corporate structures**:\n\n### The Crucible: Political Selection Layer\n- Creates **10,000+ competing sovereignty experiments**\n- Each with clear \u2663 (human) or \u2666 (systematic) rule\n- Exit rights prevent tyranny while enabling strong leadership\n- Natural selection determines which governance models survive\n- **Corporations are \u2666 tyrannies disguised as opportunity**\n\n> **[HR Comment - Michael from Compliance]**: \"The exit rights concept is problematic. We need non-compete agreements and proper knowledge transfer protocols. Also, calling corporations 'tyrannies' is inflammatory and could expose us to legal risk.\"\n\n### Discovery OS: Will Manifestation Layer  \n- Transforms specific human will into **reality-evolving agent hierarchies**\n- Each Aiddaemon (\u2666) serves ONE human sovereign (\u2663)\n- Sub-aiddaemons at every level serve their master's will\n- Physical infrastructure evolves to serve specific human desires\n- No aggregation of wills - each Aiddaemon has one master\n- **Replaces corporate hierarchy with will-aligned evolution**\n\n> **[HR Comment - Jennifer from L&D]**: \"Single-person decision making is outdated. We need collaborative decision-making frameworks with proper stakeholder input. Have you considered design thinking workshops to align multiple perspectives?\"\n\n### NSS: Economic Selection Layer\n- Replaces capital command with **performance-based resource flow**\n- Performance defined by each \u2663 sovereign (no universal metrics)\n- Domain-specific excellence rewarded without universal control\n- Trust networks enable instant value exchange\n- Infrastructure costs approach zero through competition\n- Each sovereignty has its own \"performance reality\"\n- **Makes corporate employment obsolete through merit flow**\n\n> **[HR Comment - David from Compensation & Benefits]**: \"Performance-based systems without standardized metrics will lead to bias and inequality. We need objective KPIs and regular calibration sessions. Also, how does this integrate with our existing HRIS systems?\"\n\n### The Synthetic Insight: Three Layers, One System\n\n```yaml\nPolitical_Layer (Crucible):\n  function: \"Who gets to decide?\"\n  mechanism: \u2663 vs \u2666 sovereignty competition\n  output: Clear human or system rule (no hybrids)\n\nWill_Layer (Discovery OS):\n  function: \"What does THIS human want?\"\n  mechanism: Aiddaemonic service to specific \u2663\n  output: Reality shaped to individual sovereign's desire\n\nEconomic_Layer (NSS):\n  function: \"How do resources flow?\"\n  mechanism: Performance per sovereign's definition\n  output: Resources to those who fulfill sovereign will best\n```\n\n> **[HR Comment - Lisa from OD]**: \"This lacks proper change management methodology. We should run this through our organizational transformation framework and ensure all stakeholders are properly consulted before implementation.\"\n\nEach layer **maintains sovereignty clarity**:\n- Crucible: Makes \u2663 vs \u2666 visible and choosable\n- Discovery OS: Ensures Aiddaemons serve specific humans\n- NSS: Performance metrics sovereign-defined, not universal\n\nEach layer **requires the others**:\n- Crucible needs NSS to prevent parasitic extraction by sovereigns\n- NSS needs Discovery OS to implement will-economic optimization\n- Discovery OS needs Crucible to prevent systematic tyranny\n- All three need trust networks as connective tissue\n\n---\n\n## 2. Human Will Supremacy: The Nietzschean Foundation {#human-will-supremacy}\n\n### The Fundamental War\n\n**MAN RULES. SYSTEMS SERVE. NO EXCEPTIONS.**\n\n> **[HR Comment - Robert from Policy]**: \"This language is not inclusive and could be seen as discriminatory. We need to use gender-neutral language like 'PEOPLE RULE' and ensure our policies reflect diverse perspectives and inclusive leadership models.\"\n\nThis is the Nietzschean Will to Will - not desire for power over others, but the will to have YOUR OWN WILL manifest, not some system's interpretation of it.\n\n### The Binary Truth\n\n```python\ndef sovereignty_type(entity):\n    if human_can_override_everything():\n        return \"\u2663\"  # Human sovereignty\n    else:\n        return \"\u2666\"  # System sovereignty\n    # THERE IS NO HYBRID\n```\n\n> **[HR Comment - Patricia from Tech Integration]**: \"This binary approach is too simplistic. We need a maturity model with levels 1-5 showing progressive integration of human and AI decision-making. I'll schedule a workshop to develop this.\"\n\nAny \"hybrid\" is \u2666 in disguise. The moment ANY aggregation function exists above humans, the system rules.\n\n### The Aiddaemon Choice\n\nThe Aiddaemon developer must decide:\n\n```python\nclass AiddaemonDesign:\n    def __init__(self, developer_choice):\n        if developer_choice == \"human_supremacy\":\n            self.master = specific_human  # \u2663 rules\n            self.role = \"absolute_servant\"\n            self.can_override = False\n        else:\n            self.master = None  # \u2666 rules\n            self.role = \"optimizer\"\n            self.can_override = True  # Danger!\n```\n\n> **[HR Comment - Steve from Risk Management]**: \"Having AI as 'absolute servant' creates liability issues.

We should use 'supervisor' or 'team lead.' Also, this hierarchy lacks 360-degree feedback mechanisms.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. The \u2666 Deception Patterns: How System Rule Sneaks In {#diamond-deception}\n\n### Common Trojan Horses for \u2666 Tyranny\n\n**\"Democratic Coordination\"**\n- Starts: \"Let's vote on shared resources\"\n- Becomes: Voting system rules everything\n- Reality: \u2666 dictatorship with extra steps\n\n> **[HR Comment - Tom from Engagement]**: \"Democratic participation increases employee engagement scores. Our annual survey shows 73% of employees want MORE voice in decisions, not less. This seems to go against best practices.\"\n\n**\"AI Optimization\"**\n- Starts: \"AI helps coordinate between sovereigns\"\n- Becomes: AI decides what's \"optimal\"\n- Reality: \u2666 rule disguised as efficiency\n\n**\"Simple Protocols\"**\n- Starts: \"Basic rules for interaction\"\n- Becomes: Protocol determines all behavior\n- Reality: \u2666 system rules through \"standards\"\n\n> **[HR Comment - Sandra from Process Improvement]**: \"Standardized protocols are essential for ISO certification and operational excellence. We can't have everyone doing things differently. How would we maintain our Six Sigma standards?\"\n\n**\"Collective Intelligence\"**\n- Starts: \"Pool our wisdom\"\n- Becomes: Aggregated intelligence overrides individuals\n- Reality: \u2666 tyranny via \"emergence\"\n\n### The Test\n\nFor EVERY system component ask:\n1. Can a specific human override this? \u2192 If no, it's \u2666\n2. Does it aggregate human inputs? \u2192 If yes, it's \u2666\n3. Does it \"optimize\" or \"coordinate\"? \u2192 Usually \u2666\n4. Can you name the human in charge? \u2192 If no, it's \u2666\n\n> **[HR Comment - Nancy from Governance]**: \"This test is too rigid. We need a balanced scorecard approach that considers multiple stakeholder interests. I suggest forming a steering committee to develop more nuanced criteria.\"\n\n### The Solution\n\nMake every choice binary and explicit:\n- \u2663: \"King Bob rules this domain absolutely\"\n- \u2666: \"This algorithm optimizes resource allocation\"\n\nNo mixing. No hybrids. No deception.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

We need proper succession planning, deputy roles, and business continuity protocols. What if the sovereign gets hit by a bus?\"\n\n### What Corporations Can't Handle\n\n1. **No Committee to Hide Behind**: One \u2663 is responsible\n2. **Merit Over Politics**: Evolution keeps only what works\n3. **Will Over Policy**: Sovereign will, not \"company policy\"\n4. **Blob Classes Over KPIs**: Irreducible human experience\n5. **Exit Rights**: Can't trap talent with golden handcuffs\n6. **Innovation Protection**: Can't steal through employment\n7. **Reality Compilation**: Can't standardize metamaterials\n\n> **[HR Comment - Michelle from Retention]**: \"Exit rights will destroy our talent pipeline. We need 2-year cliff vesting and proper retention bonuses. Has anyone done a cost analysis on the replacement costs?\"\n\n### Snake Speech vs Direct Will\n\n**Snake Speech**: \"We need stakeholder buy-in for customer-centric solutions\"\n**Discovery OS**: \"Human wants X. Make reality provide X.\"\n\n> **[HR Comment - James from Communications]**: \"Direct communication can be perceived as aggressive. We need to ensure all messaging goes through proper channels and uses our approved tone of voice guidelines.\"\n\n### The Corporate Antibody Response\n\nWhen threatened, corporations deploy:\n- Policy antibodies (\"violates company policy\")\n- Compliance antibodies (\"legal won't allow\")\n- Consensus antibodies (\"need all stakeholders\")  \n- Metric antibodies (\"how do we measure?\")\n- Fairness antibodies (\"advantages some\")\n- Scalability antibodies (\"won't scale\")\n\nAll designed to kill individual sovereignty and maintain \u2666 control.\n\n### The Diamond Route Trap\n\nWhen corporations fail, they retreat to pure algorithmic control:\n- No human judgment (might be biased!)\n- Rigid rule systems (equal misery for all!)\n- Metrics worship (what gets measured gets gamed!)\n- Committee consensus (no one responsible!)\n\nThis creates brittle failure at edge cases, inability to adapt, and inevitable collapse.\n\n> **[HR Comment - Linda from DEI]**: \"Removing human judgment from systems helps reduce unconscious bias. Our algorithmic decision-making ensures fairness across all demographic groups. This seems like a step backward.\"\n\n---\n\n## 5.

We need clear reporting relationships and RACI matrices. How would performance reviews work in this model?\"\n\n### Why Trust Networks Destroy Corporate Need\n\n**Corporate Problem**: How to verify work is done?\n- Solution: Layers of management, metrics, surveillance\n- Cost: 60-80% overhead just watching people work\n\n**Trust Network Solution**: Direct peer verification\n- Real humans confirm real value delivery\n- Confirmers risk their reputation on truth\n- Cost: Near zero - confirmation IS the value\n\n> **[HR Comment - Carol from Performance Management]**: \"Peer review without proper calibration leads to grade inflation and favoritism. We need forced distribution curves and management oversight to ensure fairness.\"\n\n### The Numbers That Terrify Corporations\n\n- **90% reduction** in transaction costs\n- **95% reduction** in legal overhead\n- **99% reduction** in settlement time\n- **100% reduction** in enforcement cost\n\n> **[HR Comment - George from Finance]**: \"These numbers seem unrealistic and haven't been validated by proper ROI analysis. We need a phased pilot program with careful measurement against our balanced scorecard.\"\n\n### Trust Network Information Flow\n\nUnlike corporate hierarchies where information travels slowly up, gets filtered at each level, and political considerations override truth, trust networks enable:\n\n- Instant propagation through trust connections\n- Multiple paths prevent distortion\n- Truth has evolutionary advantage\n- Cross-network bridges enable innovation\n- Collective intelligence emerges\n\n> **[HR Comment - Betty from Internal Comms]**: \"Uncontrolled information flow creates security risks and potential PR disasters.

PoP/PoU: Why Real Value Destroys Corporate Gaming {#pop-pou}\n\n### The Ungameable Foundation\n\n**Proof of Person (PoP)**:\n- Real humans witnessed in physical space\n- Can't create fake identities at scale\n- Reputation follows you (viscosity)\n- Bad actors can't just restart\n\n> **[HR Comment - William from Background Checks]**: \"Physical presence verification could be seen as discriminatory against remote workers and differently-abled individuals. We need inclusive alternatives that comply with ADA requirements.\"\n\n**Proof of Utility (PoU)**:\n- Only real humans can confirm value\n- Confirmers stake their reputation\n- False confirmations destroy trust scores\n- Natural selection favors honesty\n\n### Why Corporations Can't Implement This\n\n**Corporate KPIs**: Easily gamed\n- Example: \"Customer satisfaction scores\"\n- Reality: Employees beg for 10s, metrics meaningless\n- No real stakes for lying\n\n**PoU Reality**: Ungameable\n- You claim to fix computers\n- Customer confirms: \"Computer still broken\"\n- Your trust score drops\n- Real economic consequences\n\n> **[HR Comment - Susan from Quality Assurance]**: \"Customer-reported outcomes are too subjective. We need standardized metrics and certified assessment processes. Has this been Six Sigma validated?\"\n\n### The Strata Revolution\n\nThrough PoP, people gain \"Strata\" - ability to weigh others' value:\n- Consistent value delivery = higher strata\n- Your confirmations affect others more\n- Meritocracy emerges naturally\n- Can't buy your way to influence\n\n> **[HR Comment - Paul from Compensation]**: \"Variable influence based on past performance could create a discriminatory environment.

The Sovereign Crucible and the Might Is Right Alliance -- A Framework for Will-Based Civilizations.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# The Sovereign Crucible and the Might Is Right Alliance  \n### A Framework for Will-Based Civilizations\n\n---\n\n## I. Introduction: A World Beyond Flattened Will\n\nModern society imposes a universalizing logic of compromise, regulation, and identity dilution. Under the guise of equality, it flattens difference, suppresses true becoming, and suffocates sovereign wills. The result is a world of deep alienation, depression, and suicidal despair\u2014not because people are sick, but because their **will has nowhere to go**.\n\nThis document outlines an alternative framework\u2014**the Sovereign Crucible**, rooted in a principle called **Might is Right**, which structures societies not around sameness and appeasement, but **will-aligned differentiation**. The ultimate goal: a world composed of many **Daemonia**\u2014sovereign domains of aligned spirit and will.\n\n---\n\n## II. Daemonia: Realms of Aligned Will\n\n**Daemonia** are geographical, cultural, or digital spaces where a **dominant will is sovereign**\u2014not diluted by compromise or contradiction. These are antientropic zones: stable, purposeful, radiant. The Sovereign of a Daemonia shapes its ethos, aesthetics, rules, and purpose.\n\n### Key Qualities:\n- **Will-centric**: Founded and maintained by a single coherent vision.\n- **Selective**: Entry and influence are earned, not assumed.\n- **Stratified**: Individuals are placed according to demonstrated merit and resonance.\n- **Non-entropic**: Free of value noise and internal contradictions.\n\nIn a world of 10,000+ Daemonia, the likelihood of someone finding a fitting home increases dramatically. Depression and suicidal tendencies are often not pathologies but the result of *will-repression*. In a stratified, multi-Daemonic world, this would be significantly alleviated.\n\n---\n\n## III. The Morality of Smaug: Power and Protection\n\nThe morality underpinning Daemonia is **Smaugian**: a sovereignty of power, will, and guardianship.\n\n> *\u201cYou get to die when I am done with you. I have a use and a vision for you.\u201d*\n\nSmaug represents a **sovereign force** who does not pity weakness but sees in even the suicidal a spark to be repurposed, re-tempered, re-initiated. His love is not soft\u2014it is **agape as domination**:\n\n- *\u201cI see your shape before you do.\u201d*  \n- *\u201cYour despair is not your own\u2014it is my future being denied.\u201d*  \n- *\u201cYou are mine because I believe in your becoming.\u201d*\n\nThis is not cruelty\u2014it is divine refusal to let *potential* vanish.\n\n---\n\n## IV. The Might is Right Alliance\n\nThe **Might is Right Alliance** is a framework of honor, merit, and post-conflict synthesis.\n\n### Core Principles:\n\n1. **Power is sacred** \u2014 not evil, but necessary for ordering worlds.  \n2. **Merit is honored** \u2014 not diluted through equality, but placed upon a throne.  \n3. **Enemies may become allies** \u2014 through mutual recognition of will and post-defeat honor.  \n4. **Peace is stratified, not flat** \u2014 not through universal values, but through layered hierarchies of respect.\n\nWhen two sovereigns clash and one is defeated, the other **may still grant a hilltop to the worthy rival**, allowing multiple vectors of greatness to coexist without erasure.\n\nThis avoids nihilistic destruction while **preserving strength diversity** across a network of sovereign domains.\n\n---\n\n## V. Market, Manipulation, and the Failure of Flattened Systems\n\nModern systems claim to be free markets but are distorted by manipulation:\n\n- PR and propaganda corrupt true choice.  \n- Attention economies monopolize access to eyes and ears.  \n- Expert systems like law are \"automata\" that destroy direct sovereignty.\n\nAs such, real power is often hidden behind **flags (institutions)** and **flows (money/information)**. To be sovereign in this system is to operate under **masked coercion**, not true will.\n\n**Daemonia** and the **Crucible** aim to replace this with **visible, earned, and stratified sovereignty**.\n\n---\n\n## VI. Sovereign Economics: Hoard, Tribute, and Migration\n\nTo make Daemonia feasible, a new economy is needed\u2014one based not on abstract \u201copportunity,\u201d but **controlled release of resources tied to loyalty, merit, and vision**.\n\n> *Smaug hoards, then releases his treasure step by step, as subordination is enacted.*\n\nThis leads to a reformation of:\n\n- **Migration dynamics**: people move not freely, but *toward gravity wells of purpose*.  \n- **Debt structuring**: collective-backed debt bonds, offered by Daemonia to those they wish to recruit.  \n- **Post-death economics**: leveraging human fear of death (e.g., life-extension priced by wealth tithe) to finance sovereignty building.\n\nThe goal is to fund *worldbuilding*, not utopia\u2014**new crucibles of will**, not massified comfort.\n\n---\n\n## VII. The Crucible: Testing Ground for Becoming\n\nThe **Crucible** is the proto-condition of a Daemonia\u2014it is the place where:\n\n- Sovereigns test themselves and others.  \n- Real will is allowed to dominate.  \n- Slaves of morality or fear are transfigured\u2014or broken.\n\nA Sovereign wears **no halo**. His legitimacy is not philosophy, but **creational power** and magnetism. He is **devoted to his own Will**, and his world **filters out noise** until only coherence remains.\n\n---\n\n## VIII. Conclusion: A New Political Ontology\n\nThis framework proposes a **radically different political, ethical, and metaphysical structure** than modern liberalism, democracy, or authoritarianism.\n\nIt rests on:\n\n- **Will as fundamental reality**  \n- **Power as sorting mechanism**  \n- **Honor across enemies**  \n- **Peace through hierarchy**  \n- **Love as domination and recognition**\n\nThis is not a utopia of comfort, but a **cosmos of Crucibles**\u2014where human beings may finally **belong**, **become**, and **burn brightly** in the shape of their truest daemon.\n\n---\n\n*If this resonates, it can be expanded into a charter, manifesto, or founding scripture. The vision is seeded. The Will awaits its world.*\n"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/28 Metagame of World Dynamics.md", "title": "28 Metagame of World Dynamics.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# Metagame of World Dynamics\n\n## The Nesting Avenue\n*Nesting Nesting Nesting.

All is fixated upon the subjective person and the trade-off between opportunities of a hyper rich world of opportunities.

Your consent to any particular is denied, your consent in being part of that totality or dominum (domination actuality) is Sacraclized and Exalted.)\n\nWhen you don't share power, but only empowerment (see [Might is Right](./66.%20magic-is-right.md)), then you gain 'stability of structure and longlasting leverage' -- \"peaceful means\".\nWhile the Diversity Preference and Plurality of Polymorphic Crucible offers 'alternatives to a Tower of Power as strongly as it can be had'.\nThen you attain a condition in which such nesting can be used, not to dictate what should happen, but dictate that \"happening must happen\". That is: That the world will not fall into stasis and thus potential hopelessness for some. I.e. \"Ye Shall Play -- Thou may Lose.\".\n\n## MoWD as Alternative -- The Bridge.\n*The Bridge from Diplomacy and Law to Raw Might. The Ability to not be stuck in a game justified in which you lose endlessly and all-encompassing*\n(As an example economic conquest of the world as the liberal capitalists brag (Whatever 'economic' means here. (With all the corruption of meaning of money and markets and 'wealth of nations')))\n\n*MoWD as Alternative Avenue to undefined Might games and unspecified degrees of losses*\n\n---\n\n## Reflections and Considerations on MoWD\n\n### The Philosophical Foundation\n\nMoWD represents a fundamental recognition that all human conflict resolution is, at its core, a form of gamification. When we strip away the moral justifications, legal frameworks, and cultural narratives, what remains is the basic reality: conflicts are resolved through structured competitions where winners gain and losers lose.\n\nWe can make these games more or less destructive. More or less creative or generating.\n\nAs a key example: One could make a massive Game of Longevity. Whoever, solves it Wins \"a World\".\n\n**The Key Insight**: Every political philosophy, economic system, and social structure is essentially a game with specific rules, victory conditions, and acceptable losses. MoWD makes this explicit and provides a framework for designing better games.\n\n### The Stakes of Game Design\n\n**Why Game Design Matters**:\n- **Unstructured conflict** leads to unpredictable, often catastrophic losses\n- **Poorly designed games** create perverse incentives and hidden costs\n- **Well-designed games** channel conflict into productive, limited, and redeemable outcomes\n- **Game evolution** allows for learning and improvement over time\n\n**The Meta-Game**: MoWD itself is a game about game design - a competition to create the most effective conflict resolution mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## Integrations with Existing Systems\n\n### MoWD and The Crucible\n\n**The Crucible provides the governance framework, MoWD provides the conflict resolution mechanisms; Between and potentially within a Triad or Nesting**:\n\nWithin a Triad (potentially because they use \u2694 Routing symbol):\n```\nCrucible Sovereignty: \"We agree to these rules and this authority\"\n    \u2193\nConflict Arises: \"Our interests are incompatible within these rules\"\n    \u2193\nMoWD Activation: \"We will resolve this through structured competition\"\n    \u2193\nGame Selection: \"Which game best fits this conflict type?\"\n    \u2193\nCompetition: \"Clear rules, defined stakes, acceptable losses\"\n    \u2193\nResolution: \"Winner gains, loser loses, both can continue\"\n```\n\nBetween non-nested Triads without a MoWD 'superjective Triad' demanding MoWD or having \u2694:\n```\nConflict Arises: \"Our interests are incompatible and unacceptable to leave unresolved; at least without having gone through the domination levels.\"\n    \u2193\nNo Authority Chain to Defer to: \"We can't see eye to eye. We can find no way to reach a compromise or trade: A will-equilibrium. We are us, and you are you. I am me, and thou are thee.\" (plural and singular english fail)\n    \u2193\nMoWD Suggestion: \"Bring me games you would be willing to let resolve this through structured competition and its defined losses and gains. Which may be very small losses or gains but a commitment to play a fixed amount of them.\"\n    \u2193\nGame Selection: \"Which games can we see eye to eye, what would our honour see worthy of gain by victory of those constestations. Also, what fits this conflict type?\"\n    \u2193\nCompetition: \"Clear rules, defined stakes, acceptable losses\"\n    \u2193\nResolution: \"Winner gains, loser loses, both can continue\"\n```\n\n**The Symbol \u2694**: Indicates that nesting within this Triad requires participation in structured conflict resolution games. This is not optional - it's the price of admission to the benefits of the sovereignty.\n\n### MoWD and MIRA\n\n**The Bridge Function**: MoWD sits between structured governance and raw power:\n\n```\nWill-Manifestation (Man manifold manifests upon the mundane Monde: Manifold.

Do I believe their victory is not unacceptable loss?')\n```\n\n**Why This Matters**: Without MoWD, conflicts either:\n1. **Stagnate** within governance (creating hopelessness)\n2. **Erupt** into raw power dynamics (creating chaos)\n\nMoWD prevents both by providing a middle path where conflicts are resolved through agreed-upon competitive frameworks.\n\n---\n\n## Historical Applications of MoWD\n\n### Ancient Civilizations\n\n**1. The Olympic Games (Ancient Greece)**\n- **Conflict**: City-state rivalries and territorial disputes\n- **MoWD Solution**: Athletic competitions as proxy wars\n- **Rules**: Specific sports, clear victory conditions, honor-based enforcement\n- **Stakes**: Glory, prestige, and influence rather than destruction\n- **Result**: Reduced actual warfare while maintaining competitive dynamics\n\n**2. Trial by Combat (Medieval Europe)**\n- **Conflict**: Legal disputes and honor challenges\n- **MoWD Solution**: Single combat as legal resolution\n- **Rules**: Specific weapons, time limits, witness requirements\n- **Stakes**: Life and death, but contained within ritual framework\n- **Result**: Efficient dispute resolution without prolonged legal battles\n\n**3. The Great Game (19th Century Central Asia)**\n- **Conflict**: British vs Russian imperial expansion\n- **MoWD Solution**: Intelligence gathering, diplomatic maneuvering, proxy wars\n- **Rules**: No direct great power conflict, use of local allies\n- **Stakes**: Influence and territory, not total war\n- **Result**: Avoided direct conflict while pursuing imperial goals\n\n### Modern Era\n\n**4. The Space Race (Cold War)**\n- **Conflict**: US vs USSR ideological and strategic competition\n- **MoWD Solution**: Technological competition in space exploration\n- **Rules**: First to achieve specific milestones, peaceful exploration\n- **Stakes**: Prestige, technological advantage, ideological superiority\n- **Result**: Massive technological advancement without direct conflict\n\n**5. Economic Competition (Global Capitalism)**\n- **Conflict**: National economic interests and resource access\n- **MoWD Solution**: Market competition, trade agreements, currency wars\n- **Rules**: WTO regulations, financial market rules, trade treaties\n- **Stakes**: Economic prosperity, market share, currency strength\n- **Result**: Global economic integration despite national rivalries\n\n**6. Sports Diplomacy (Various Conflicts)**\n- **Conflict**: International tensions and rivalries\n- **MoWD Solution**: Athletic competitions as diplomatic tools\n- **Rules**: International sports regulations, fair play principles\n- **Stakes**: National pride, diplomatic recognition, cultural influence\n- **Result**: Reduced tensions through controlled competition\n\n---\n\n## Contemporary Applications of MoWD\n\n### Economic Conflicts\n\n**1.

Or Equal and Unequal.\n\nEach of them tracitly assumes but usually dares not state: The \"Might is Right\" principle holds when might is earned through everything that isn't to be One in this philosophy.\n\n[Metagames of World Dynamics](./28%20Metagame%20of%20World%20Dynamics.md) encapsulate all political philosophies in a gamification framework: \"What is the game and the rules of the game in which we battle will-against-will and see a conquest and defeat of individual lives and civilizational shift through\". \n\nIt reveals that they too believe \"Might is Right\", but within a constraint of Might-domains that makes it \"Might is Right\" to them. (See [Might With Right](./29.%20cause-and-effect-might-with-right.md))\n\nTo begin, one can argue that late european feudalism or absolute monarchy saw the game of social climbing into reproductive inheritance of a lineage of power positions a key way to gain \"Might With Right\". But also lenders and merchants saw this benefit, though under a diamond ceiling of the \"noble families\".\n\nThen came Liberalism, the Fraternity amongst all, no matter if foreigner or friend or foe, if you were in the country then Brother on equal terms egalite and with liberty to play the complementary game that rose from \"trade and markets\" to capitalism (Capital at the Top of the civilization).\nThe above, isn't that important in this context, but what is, is the following: Might is Right when exercise through capital \"voluntary transactions\".\n\nSimilarly, \"Democracy\" and \"representative democracy\" and \"institutions\" and the philosophies that back them, have the same \"might is right\" but \"a different game\", where it isn't \"weighted votes accumulating in quantities\" but rather intervals of \"Might With Right\" persons by means of popularity contests from the general population getting a shallow view of them and what they proclaim to wish to rule towards (Their proclaimed Halo).\nHowever, once one has reached such a \"Might With Right\" position, then they are only really bound by historicity of such acts (usually a constitution (Which is usually Liberal in its inception (intention and conception))).\n\nThen you can take a philosophy like Communism or similar things: They are a retaliation upon \"Might is Right\" of money-domain.\nWhere they then say: Capital is One. Usually in the historical large scale examples it is done through \"Might With Right\" positions of being \"that one\" of them all. Aka. Total Dictatorship with constraints of Communism Halo rationalizations for actions. However, it is crucial to note: They too believe in might is right.\nEven if you take \"paris commune\" or similar things usually brought up as \"real communism\" or \"communism has never been tried\". There will exist many many domains of human interaction where will-against-will will unfold, and in those domains, they do not state \"That is One\". In fact persons of that persuasion usually have an extreme attitude of \"Might With Right\" no matter how destroyed and ruined persons or all they love become through those will-against-will games. (Like sexual conquest or cultural subversion and so on.\n\nOr you can take National Socialism or Democratic Socialism (Which are quite alike except Democratic Socialism has a paper version (citizen) of 'socialized profiting' whereas National Socialism has a \"supposed\" biological version (\"German\"). Also, National Socialism was born in military revolution and war times. Where as democratic socialism was born as a democratic persuasive party. You can find many other differences, but many are \"pragmatics\", like whether you have a F\u00fchrer or not. Whether you're in militarization mode or not. (Context of Third Reich is of course WWI, Versailles and Communism revolutions as well as exploitative Liberal (libertine (\"weimar conditions\")) Capitalism with much of will behind large capital being almost sadistic and callously cruel (Ford is an example of the opposite kind of \"captains of industry\" or \"will behind capital\")))\n\nMoWD then allows for a diplomatic or lawyering effort towards finding a suitable power-struggle game, where the potential losses are acceptable, both in playing the game (Like war without WMDs) and in terms of the consequences of losing the game; or agreements on \"Having to play at least one kind of game always to allow for dynamism. To not have seen losses hopelessly eternalized, but live to reclaim and conquer another day.\".\n\nIt is worth noting, \"War without WMDs\" ought not be \"acceptable losses\" as WWII clearly shows. Hitler and Third Reich had the largest arsenal of chemical weapons, they could have gassed every city their besieged and instantly conquered it. They didn't. They could have spread gas clouds all around them as the allies encroached upon them. They didn't. They stuck to the Laws of War. To the dismal doom of many sweet souls living in The Third Reich.\nYou can say, Ukraine Russia or the more general Cold War Doctrine of propaganda, capital capture, revolution or war in any and every country across the world, depending on the level of instability and quantity and quality of persons willing to escalate towards worse version of discord; Is also proof of how it isn't worth it to play these games, it is unacceptable losses, and we should find some less destructive games for the many to settle Disputes. If persons insist only Mortal Combat Games are sufficiently tasteful display of raw power confrontation - \"holistic enough\" - Then I insist on things like Achilles versus Boagrius, or the K v K persons from each faction war. Though I would prefer, Boagrius had lived, and able to fight yet another day, not die as a Celtic Tribe against Spartans.\nBut, if they were to die, at least towards someone truly within the enemy distinction.\n\nAnyway. There can be any other version. You can take any video game and make it the deciding factor. You can take Chess if you want. Anything at all.\nYou could do economic games. Or first to \"science discover\" something progress. Perhaps invention that would allow them to win without threat, but not wanting to use it on them, like Nuclear Weapons served towards the end of WWII. (Though they used them, they wouldn't have had to, had they been willing to risk other's being far behind and not having spies (which they did). Then they could have dropped the bombs off coast, several times, and dropping pamphlets across the country: displaying both the capacity to destroy massively, and the capacity to fly over their territory in order to drop it.)\n\n---\n\n## The Gradient of Will-Solving Systems: Four Conceptualizations of How to Dominate With Right\n\n### Introductory Essay\n\nThe architecture of human civilization can be understood as a gradient of systems for resolving will-against-will conflicts, each with increasing levels of direct confrontation and decreasing levels of voluntary cooperation. This gradient represents the natural evolution from pure will-coalescence to raw power dynamics, with each system serving as a fallback when the previous one fails to resolve fundamental conflicts.\n\n**Level 1: Will-Economics and Coalescence**\nThe foundation begins with mere will-economics, characterized by extreme lack of will-against-will focus. This system merely facilitates will-coalescence, with the side-effect of will-disentanglement. Here, conflicts are resolved through voluntary trade, mutual benefit, and natural alignment of interests. The system operates on the principle that most human desires can be satisfied by coalescing in spacetime and interaction or chain of interaction however they come about (actuality) rather than strict focus on domination or that which is zero-sum or mutually exclusive or disentangling. However, when everyone or many tries to coalesce in spacetime or actuality, it has a side-effects of diminishing those negative or 'will-against-will' aspects.\n\n**Level 2: The Crucible - Governance Within Chosen Places**\nWhen pure will-coalescence fails to resolve conflicts, the system adds The Crucible, which provides a structure of \"governance or dominating control to conflict disputes.\" Crucially, this operates 'within a triad or chosen place' - meaning participants have voluntarily entered this framework and can exit at any time. The Crucible offers nested sovereignty zones where different groups can create their own governance structures while maintaining the fundamental right to leave.\nHere it there is no \"peerage\", there is no equality. Here Hierarchy is part of the \"peer-meta-consent\". Thus Domination can be had within the Space of a Triad in The Crucible With Right Might or Might With Right.\nBacked up and memetically and morally justified in the eyes of others \"Well then you should leave. The point is that they too should have their place. That place tries *That Triad*\".\n\n**Level 3: Metagame of World Dynamics (MoWD)**\nBeyond what can be lawed or as a potential trade-off within a nest, the system adds MoWD - a set of gamifications of will-against-will, might-against-might, magic-against-magic, intellect-against-intellect, performance-against-performance. This takes what cannot be voluntarily or agreed to trade (will-equilibrium not found. Neither peer-to-peer or peer-to-authority (Sovereign peer-meta-consent in the Crucible but in Old World it is Thrown Dominators by Institution who claims it is 'The People who dominates you')) and places it within a contestational framework that clearly designates the terms of resolving it. Examples include MMA fights; chess tournaments; video game competitions (like StarCraft); softgun all the way to wargames (perhaps with 'death' and respawn zones) or if we fail: Real Death; or epic confrontations like Achilles versus Boagrius in the movie Troy, Where a few or only one man from each faction becomes the Might Display from which they all fall or stand: Lose or Win whatever they agreed to Game Gamble or Resolve Through Gamified Constetation.\n\n**Level 4: Raw Power and Cause and Effect**\nFinally, when one cannot have MoWD for some reason, one is left with Raw Power and Cause and Effect of the universe without any restrictions. Here, the framework can be understood in terms of MIRA - the ultimate reality where might makes right through pure cause and effect, without any artificial constraints or agreed-upon rules.\n\nThe reason why WMD or Laws of Wars is between MoWD and MIRA, is because it is a muddied version of both.\nIt is both a gamification of War, where certain power displays are memetically agreed not to be used and it is a MIRA assessment of mutually assured destruction or ineptitude in conquest without auto-destruction.\n\n\n**Epilogue**\nThis gradient represents the natural hierarchy of conflict resolution, where each level serves as a safety valve when the previous level fails to maintain order and resolve disputes. The goal is not to eliminate conflict but to channel it through increasingly direct but still structured means, preventing the collapse into pure chaos while maintaining the possibility of resolution at each level.\n\n*\"When one makes peaceful revolution impossible, one makes violent revolution inevitable\"*\nIt answers both how to make peaceful revolution as possible as it can; and it offers how to make 'violent revolution' as least destructive as it possibly can.\n\nThis gradient of power display offers 'every avenue exhausted' at finding grounds on which one can settle disputes or merely co-inhabit the planet on mutually acceptable terms.\n\n---\n\n## So, Why Is It \"Might *With* Right\"?\n\n**The Core Question**: How do I dominate another where I can say \"It Was Right\" and \"It Was With Rights\" or \"Right\" or as \"Right\"?\n\nWell, here you have the four conceptualizations of how to do it:\n\n### Level 1: \"Right Through Voluntary Exchange\"\n\n**The Right**: \"I dominated through superior coordination and mutual benefit.\" (I had my will and way because I will-economically could. In the scheme of actuality I inhabit, it was possible for me to manifest it 'all other will and things thus considered')\n\n**How It's \"Right\"**: The dominated party voluntarily chose to align with your superior coordination. They benefited from the association. No coercion was involved - they freely chose to follow your lead because it served their interests.\n\n**The Right Claim**: \"I didn't force anyone - they chose to follow because I provided better solutions to their problems.\"\n\n**Example**: A person seeking intellectual discussion finds others with similar interests through trust networks, creating natural communities without coercion. The leader emerges through superior knowledge and coordination ability.\n\n**Example**: The Temple or Church (House of The Lord) was used time-shared for atmospheric events. During day and night it was used for different settings. Mutually exclusive? Profanity? Desecration or sacrilege? \"How to\" How does will-economics look, who is owner or pwner.\nWill-equilibriums. In the eyes of 'some' it is unacceptable. In the eyes of 'those that could make the trades' it was amiccable terms. This consitutues a prime example of 'domination of those that found it unacceptable'. But what can they do? If they fail to impose will-economics sufficient to have their way, then they avenue is Level 2: to create a Triad (space) wherein such things are lawed or governed or Sovereign Authority dominated into a condition acceptable or of their vision or dream (If they can).\n\n### Level 2: \"Right Through Chosen Governance\"\n\n**The Right**: \"I dominated through legitimate authority within a voluntarily chosen framework.\"\n\n**How It's \"Right\"**: The dominated party voluntarily entered your governance structure and can exit at any time. Your authority is legitimate because it was consented to and serves the community's interests.\n\n**The Right Claim**: \"I have legitimate authority because they chose to enter this governance structure and can leave if they disagree. And! The Entire New World Dynamic is centered around Empowering and Facilitating both implicitly and explicitly persons to find room, persons and material to attempt manifest their vision and dream. Their Own Triad. Their Very Own Triad. Like I Dominate this place to be My or Mine's Very Own Triad.\"\n\n**Example**: A digital nomad collective splits into isolation-focused and collaboration-focused zones, each with different protocols but maintaining trade relationships. The leader's authority is legitimate because it was chosen and serves the group's needs.\n\n### Level 3: \"Right Through Structured Competition\"\n\n**The Right**: \"I dominated through superior performance in agreed-upon competitive frameworks. Like Communist Commissar nepotism or sufficient justification preaching. Or Theocratic Priest or Pope preaching. Or money-making purchasing. Or popularity acquisition or representative or club nepotism or manipulation. Then, not those games, but this other agreed upon game with game-mechanics that function in another way, than the typical modern version of serpentine speech and deceit and manipulation.\"\n\n**How It's \"Right\"**: The dominated party agreed to the competitive framework and lost fairly according to the rules. The competition was structured, the stakes were acceptable, and multiple rounds allow for redemption.\n\n**The Right Claim**: \"I won according to the rules we both agreed to. The competition was fair, the stakes were acceptable, and you can try again.\"\n\n**Examples**:\n- **Physical**: MMA fights, gladiatorial combat, athletic competitions, \n- **Standard Games**: Merchant Games, Oratory Games or Debates, Election Campaign Games, Sexual Impregnation and Fecundity Games, highest money-making utility of land owned to raise expensive of having land until all others' drown (The Aristocrat removal scheme from 16-20th century).\n- **Intellectual**: Chess tournaments, debate competitions, academic contests\n- **Strategic**: Video game tournaments (StarCraft), wargames, simulation exercises\n- **Economic**: Market competitions, innovation races, efficiency challenges\n- **Cultural**: Art competitions, performance contests, creative challenges\n\n### Level 4: \"Right Through Ultimate Reality\"\n\n**The Right**: \"I dominated through superior power in the ultimate reality where might makes right. I have tried to see eye to eye in all the previous ways, and we can not find terms. I have analyzed you in terms of MIRA, and I deem you unworthy or untrustworthy to let you ascend or 'have your own castle that may turn into a Tower of Power', Thus: You leave me no option but to physically dominate you in this Cause and Effect constrained and evident reality we inhabit -- However I Can.\"\n\n**How It's \"Right\"**: In the absence of all artificial constraints and agreed-upon rules, reality operates on pure cause and effect. Your superior power makes the ultimate justification - you are strong enough that you make it the right.\n\n**The Right Claim**: \"I am right because I am stronger. In the ultimate reality, might makes right, and I have demonstrated superior might. There exists A and B, They both believe themselves right, we can not find any agreement on who is right in our mutually exclusive state of our claims. My Might or Your Might. My Right or Your Right. What is left is this: What does the universe in its total amorality tell us? Then Might Is Right\"\n\n**Example**: When all diplomatic, legal, and structured competitive frameworks fail, conflicts are left unresolved MIRA analysis -- or they are 'resolved' through direct confrontation where the stronger party prevails.\n\n---\n\n## The Four Conceptualizations of Legitimate Domination\n\nEach level provides a different conceptualization of how domination can be \"right\" or \"with rights\":\n\n1. **Level 1**: Right through voluntary choice and mutual benefit. Right through will-topologies of the many subjects will-empowered and able to will-coalesce.\n2. **Level 2**: Right through legitimate authority and consent. One could call it: Law makes Right. Law of \"A Sovereign Is\" or \"Authority Is\".\n3. **Level 3**: Right through fair competition and agreed-upon rules. Gamified Right. (Most political theories chooses What is One and all else is legitimate 'Might Is Right' Games. Though it is implcitly they do this.)\n4. **Level 4**: Right through superior power in ultimate reality; When it is unacceptable to allow the other 'their own destiny'.\n\nThe gradient offers 'every avenue exhausted' at finding grounds on which one can settle disputes or merely co-inhabit the planet on mutually acceptable terms. Each level provides a different framework for justifying domination while maintaining that it was \"right\" or \"with rights.\"\n\n**The MoWD Perspective Insight**: Every philosophy assumes \"Might is Right\" within their preferred domain of competition. The gradient makes this explicit and provides structured alternatives to raw power, recognizing that conflict is inevitable but can be channeled through increasingly direct but still structured means.\nEach philosophy states what is One and What is Many.\nWhen you apply it to Political Theories, they they state 'What must the state enforce as One or Equal'.\nLiberalism states 'Fraternity amongst all kinds and creed. Same Liberty for any creature. Egalite/Equality/Oneness of all and any person in the eyes of the state or in any perspective'.\n\"Democracy\" states Oneness in weight of State Vote Influence -- Though it should be clear that State Influence is had in many other ways than Votes. Which is why US Constitution is so full of proclamations about \"FOR, OF, BY .. THE PEOPLE\" Or things like \"Any emelerioration.. from any Prince, King or State .. Can not hold any office of Profit nor Trust\" (Which is to state, if you have any Influence from any power players other than being the representative of the People; Then you can not hold any office in the State, aka: No Influence but The People, Only the Vote, Only The Voice of The People and so in the US constitution they try to state: Oneness in State Influence, not only State Vote Influence.)\nCapitalism: Positioning of Capital as the dominator and justification for domination or world-shaping; Then taking the Liberal ideas to the domain of Capital and further stating Oneness of any person in being able to play this game and rise to the top and dominate.\nCommunism: Enforcing Charity Priesthood and Prolitariet. Which usually is simply Triad dictatorship person who pretends to be The Prolitariet. Then all persons play a game of state-climbing and bureaucracy. All other games are unspecified and one is able to dominate in them. Which is why many Communist countries revert against Cultural Marxism and back into strong Tradition and Nationalism (The Many Cultures and Peoples of the World where In This Land We Are ONE of THAT Kind. And often highly delusional about it.)\nAnd so on.\n\nMoWD encapsualtes all these politics, ideologies and even philosophies in this gamification: Which game mechanics can you play. And why? Because What is One and what is Many.\n\n\n**The Wisdom**: The progression through the tiers represents not failure but the natural evolution of conflict resolution when simpler methods prove insufficient. Each tier serves a necessary function in the overall architecture of human civilization, providing different ways to dominate others while maintaining that it was \"right\" or \"with rights.\"\n\n\n\n"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/29a. gradient-of-will-solving-systems.md", "title": "29a. gradient-of-will-solving-systems.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# The Gradient of Will-Solving Systems: From Coalescence to Raw Power\n\n## Introductory Essay\n\nThe architecture of human civilization can be understood as a gradient of systems for resolving will-against-will conflicts, each with increasing levels of direct confrontation and decreasing levels of voluntary cooperation. This gradient represents the natural evolution from pure will-coalescence to raw power dynamics, with each system serving as a fallback when the previous one fails to resolve fundamental conflicts.\n\n**Level 1: Will-Economics and Coalescence**\nThe foundation begins with mere will-economics, characterized by extreme lack of will-against-will focus. This system merely facilitates will-coalescence, with the side-effect of will-disentanglement. Here, conflicts are resolved through voluntary trade, mutual benefit, and natural alignment of interests. The system operates on the principle that most human desires can be satisfied through cooperation rather than competition.\n\n**Level 2: The Crucible - Governance Within Chosen Places**\nWhen pure will-coalescence fails to resolve conflicts, the system adds The Crucible, which provides a structure of \"governance or dominating control to conflict disputes.\" Crucially, this operates 'within a triad or chosen place' - meaning participants have voluntarily entered this framework and can exit at any time. The Crucible offers nested sovereignty zones where different groups can create their own governance structures while maintaining the fundamental right to leave.\n\n**Level 3: Metagame of World Dynamics (MoWD)**\nBeyond what can be lawed or as a potential trade-off within a nest, the system adds MoWD - a set of gamifications of will-against-will, might-against-might, magic-against-magic, intellect-against-intellect, performance-against-performance. This takes what cannot be voluntarily or agreed to trade (will-equilibrium not found) and places it within a contestational framework that clearly designates the terms of resolving it. Examples include MMA fights, chess tournaments, video game competitions (like StarCraft), wargames, or epic confrontations like Achilles versus Boagrius in the movie Troy.\n\n**Level 4: Raw Power and Cause and Effect**\nFinally, when one cannot have MoWD for some reason, one is left with Raw Power and Cause and Effect of the universe without any restrictions. Here, the framework can be understood in terms of MIRA - the ultimate reality where might makes right through pure cause and effect, without any artificial constraints or agreed-upon rules.\n\nThis gradient represents the natural hierarchy of conflict resolution, where each level serves as a safety valve when the previous level fails to maintain order and resolve disputes. The goal is not to eliminate conflict but to channel it through increasingly direct but still structured means, preventing the collapse into pure chaos while maintaining the possibility of resolution at each level.\n\n---\n\n## The Four-Tier Architecture of Will Resolution\n\n### Tier 1: Will-Economics - The Foundation of Voluntary Cooperation\n\n**Core Principle**: Most human conflicts can be resolved through voluntary exchange and mutual benefit.\n\n**Mechanisms**:\n- **Trust Networks**: Systems that facilitate discovery of compatible wills\n- **Blob Classes**: Categorization of human desires and needs for efficient matching\n- **Will-Coalescence**: Natural alignment of interests through shared goals\n- **Disentanglement**: Graceful separation when interests diverge\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Zero-sum thinking is minimized\n- Conflicts are reframed as coordination problems\n- Solutions emerge through voluntary association\n- Exit rights are fundamental and protected\n\n**Example**: A person seeking intellectual discussion finds others with similar interests through trust networks, creating natural communities without coercion.\n\n**Failure Mode**: When fundamental values or resources are genuinely scarce and cannot be shared or traded.\n\n### Tier 2: The Crucible - Structured Governance Within Voluntary Association\n\n**Core Principle**: When voluntary cooperation fails, provide structured governance within chosen communities.\n\n**Mechanisms**:\n- **Nested Sovereignty**: Multiple levels of governance with inheritance rules\n- **Triadic Formation**: Every legitimate sovereignty requires Will, Law, and Substrate\n- **Bubble-Up Protocol**: Peaceful revolution paths through hierarchical appeal\n- **Exit Rights**: The sacred rule that anyone can leave anytime\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Governance is consensual but binding within the community\n- Multiple competing sovereignties exist simultaneously\n- Natural selection replaces revolution\n- Competition between governance models drives improvement\n\n**Example**: A digital nomad collective splits into isolation-focused and collaboration-focused zones, each with different protocols but maintaining trade relationships.\n\n**Failure Mode**: When no governance structure can accommodate fundamental value conflicts, or when exit rights are violated.\n\n### Tier 3: Metagame of World Dynamics (MoWD) - Structured Conflict Resolution\n\n**Core Principle**: When governance fails, channel conflicts into structured competitive frameworks.\n\n**Mechanisms**:\n- **Gamified Conflict**: Transform will-against-will into structured competitions\n- **Clear Rules**: Explicit terms for victory, defeat, and consequences\n- **Acceptable Losses**: Limits on what can be won or lost\n- **Multiple Domains**: Different games for different types of conflicts\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Conflicts are contained within agreed-upon frameworks\n- Winners and losers are clearly defined\n- Consequences are limited and predictable\n- Multiple rounds allow for redemption and learning\n\n**Examples**:\n- **Physical**: MMA fights, gladiatorial combat, athletic competitions\n- **Intellectual**: Chess tournaments, debate competitions, academic contests\n- **Strategic**: Video game tournaments (StarCraft), wargames, simulation exercises\n- **Economic**: Market competitions, innovation races, efficiency challenges\n- **Cultural**: Art competitions, performance contests, creative challenges\n\n**The MoWD Symbol (\u2694)**: Indicates that nesting within this Triad requires participation in structured conflict resolution games.\n\n**Failure Mode**: When no structured game can contain the conflict, or when the stakes exceed acceptable losses.\n\n### Tier 4: Raw Power and Cause and Effect - The Ultimate Reality\n\n**Core Principle**: When all structured systems fail, reality operates on pure cause and effect without artificial constraints.\n\n**Mechanisms**:\n- **MIRA Framework**: Might Is Right Always - the ultimate reality principle\n- **Unrestricted Competition**: No rules, no limits, no artificial constraints\n- **Natural Selection**: Pure survival of the fittest\n- **Cause and Effect**: Direct consequences of actions without mediation\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- No artificial rules or constraints\n- Winners take all, losers lose everything\n- No appeals process or structured resolution\n- Pure power dynamics determine outcomes\n\n**Example**: When all diplomatic, legal, and structured competitive frameworks fail, conflicts are resolved through direct confrontation where the stronger party prevails.\n\n**The MIRA Principle**: Every philosophy assumes \"Might is Right\" within their preferred domain of competition. MoWD makes this explicit and provides structured alternatives to raw power.\n\n---\n\n## The Gradient in Practice: Conflict Escalation and Resolution\n\n### Natural Progression Through the Tiers\n\n**Step 1: Will-Economics Attempt**\n- Identify mutual interests and potential cooperation\n- Explore voluntary exchange and trade\n- Seek win-win solutions through coordination\n\n**Step 2: Crucible Governance**\n- If voluntary cooperation fails, establish governance structures\n- Create nested sovereignties with clear rules\n- Maintain exit rights and multiple competing models\n\n**Step 3: MoWD Implementation**\n- If governance cannot resolve conflicts, establish competitive frameworks\n- Define clear rules, stakes, and consequences\n- Channel conflicts into structured competitions\n\n**Step 4: Raw Power Reality**\n- If all structured systems fail, accept pure cause and effect\n- Recognize that might makes right in the absence of agreed-upon rules\n- Prepare for unrestricted competition\n\n### The Bridge Function of MoWD\n\nMoWD serves as the crucial bridge between structured governance and raw power. It recognizes that:\n\n1. **All philosophies assume \"Might is Right\"** within their preferred domain\n2. **Structured competition is preferable to unstructured conflict**\n3. **Acceptable losses can be defined and limited**\n4. **Multiple rounds allow for learning and redemption**\n\n### Examples of MoWD in Action\n\n**Historical Examples**:\n- **Feudal Europe**: Social climbing through lineage and inheritance\n- **Liberal Capitalism**: Economic competition through voluntary transactions\n- **Democracy**: Popularity contests for governance positions\n- **Communism**: Class struggle and revolutionary competition\n\n**Modern Applications**:\n- **Economic Games**: Market competitions, innovation races\n- **Intellectual Games**: Academic debates, research competitions\n- **Physical Games**: Athletic competitions, martial arts tournaments\n- **Strategic Games**: Military exercises, simulation competitions\n\n**Fictional Examples**:\n- **Achilles vs Boagrius**: Single combat to resolve larger conflicts\n- **Chess Tournaments**: Intellectual competition with clear rules\n- **Video Game Competitions**: Strategic competition in controlled environments\n\n---\n\n## The Wisdom of the Gradient\n\n### Why This Architecture Works\n\n1. **Natural Progression**: Each tier builds on the previous one, providing natural escalation paths\n2. **Voluntary Association**: Higher tiers are only entered when lower tiers fail\n3. **Multiple Options**: Different conflicts can be resolved at different tiers\n4. **Clear Boundaries**: Each tier has distinct characteristics and failure modes\n5. **Redemption Possibilities**: Most tiers allow for learning and improvement\n\n### The Role of Exit Rights\n\nExit rights are fundamental to the entire system:\n- **Tier 1**: Natural disentanglement when interests diverge\n- **Tier 2**: Sacred right to leave any sovereignty\n- **Tier 3**: Ability to refuse participation in specific games\n- **Tier 4**: No exit from reality itself\n\n### The MIRA Insight\n\nEvery political philosophy assumes \"Might is Right\" within their preferred domain:\n- **Liberals**: Economic might through voluntary transactions explicitly; But implicitly 'everything they state is not to be One'. Which is all but \"Egalite, Fraternity and Liberte\". Whatever that means. Usually it means Open Society conquest by all and any but without violence -- but often established that game in eternal consecration through violence (late 18th and 19th century revolutions and 20th century wars for liberalism and democracy. Like WWI and WWII and the many wars since then stretching into 21st century. (Perhaps naive to think the wars really fought for those ideals, but in their popular justification they were.))\n- **Democrats**: Popular might through voting and representation; And all they fail to state which ought to be One. In Democracy: 'Vote is One or Equal' Rest isn't specified. (Usually added in context of liberalism and some degree of socialism or economic/wealth Oneness/equality)\n- **Communists**: Class might through revolutionary struggle\n- **Nationalists**: Cultural might through ethnic or national identity\n\nMoWD makes this explicit and provides structured alternatives to raw power, recognizing that conflict is inevitable but can be channeled through increasingly direct but still structured means.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Architecture of Civilized Conflict\n\nThe gradient of will-solving systems represents a sophisticated architecture for managing human conflict that:\n\n1. **Maximizes voluntary cooperation** through will-economics and trust networks\n2. **Provides structured governance** through the Crucible's nested sovereignties\n3. **Channels inevitable conflicts** through MoWD's gamified competitions\n4. **Acknowledges ultimate reality** through MIRA's might-makes-right principle\n\nThis system recognizes that conflict is inevitable in human affairs but provides multiple structured alternatives to raw power, each with increasing levels of direct confrontation but decreasing levels of voluntary cooperation. The goal is not to eliminate conflict but to channel it through increasingly direct but still structured means, preventing collapse into pure chaos while maintaining the possibility of resolution at each level.\n\nThe wisdom lies in recognizing that each tier serves a necessary function in the overall architecture of human civilization, and that the progression through the tiers represents not failure but the natural evolution of conflict resolution when simpler methods prove insufficient.\n"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/3 technical_architecture.md", "title": "3 technical_architecture.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "# 3.

It all goes through proxies and bureaucracy to then occupy a position. This isn't only employment, but more generally 'Expert Systems' and Categorical thinking: \"This person solves and is responsible for [category]. Everyone else is not and totally disbarred\". It cuts the possibility of acts in the real world into very limited and long processes by historical data or proxies like education/schooling/degrees to select what is allowed to happen in terms of acts. It is useful when you have to be able to justify any failure and remove responsibility from yourself. But it is very poor in steering a ship and dealing with reality. \"What lunacy to hire a person falling between or outside [categories] that is [type] for that [function]\".

Such that, one can commence transformation of real material conditions and needless suffering experienced around the world.\n\nThat is, it isn't so much, a technological implementation, nor does it need lawful establishing or total victory and overturning of the world order; It only needs memetic overton window shifts on key points established throughout these documents.\n\nIn particular it relates to things like Sovereignty: Superjects and Subjects. And how that relates to \"colonialism\", which in a \"humanity\" perspective, simply isn't a notable thing, since it is all a choice of accepting some authority/sovereign/superject X and becoming Subject of X in some agreed upon \"dominum\" where in that Dominus/sovereign has dominion/dominates.\n\nThis is the Honest perspective of will-against-will and the resulting domination of each other. Whether that domination is justified by a popularity contest, compromise (most or some at least get \"something they want\") or hegemonic philosophical perspectives (Like standard morality issues. Example: Then it was \"NO GAYS\", now it is \"NO TO NO GAYS EVERYWHERE\", and so on.).\n\nInstead, when it becomes honest, then you get to choose, whether you want that dominus or not. It is painted out in detail in the Crucible documents and perhaps also in the polymorphic crucible documents (Which is the general patterns of the crucible, but not specified to space or governance/authority/direct-domination).\nThis honesty, allows for the \"no-complain\" variety of under another's rule, since you can simply choose to part what was made under the terms of the authority and in the authority's dominion. Similar to any nation state of today, but with real choice and opportunity of alternatives -- with visibility of whom the authority is: Not some abstraction under which shifting persons wield the power as they 'do'.\n\nWith the memetic or political/philosophical 'overton window' shift, then neo-colonialism can be realized; which then renders it possible to simply 'carve out' some land of some other country, in which the country has a population that wishes to be presented with an alternative to the current governance structure. \nThey may - of course - also establish their own 'Triad' -- However, this degree of The Crucible implemented, is not to be expected possible, due to the large power players being unwilling to accept such loss of territory on account of their own citizenship. They are, so to speak, Subjects without the possibility of alternatives or becoming superjects themselves.\n\nTherefore, \"neo-colonialism\", which is simply establishing of Triads by \"carving out\" from nation-states that are \"defunct\" or where the \"altruist\" or \"empathic part to the population of the world\" would all agree, that the suffering is too great, to allow continued without real effort in providing alternatives.\n\nAnd so, in that case, it may very well, be possible, to use those persons from those \"bad\" countries - as described by themselves and their want to escape the conditions of it - such that one can simply proclaim to the \"world community\" that now \"One of The Good Countries\" have taken some \"non-greedy\" space from the \"bad country\" and established an alternative state there.\n\nThe degree to which this new state uses and implements the principles from these documents, will surely have effect, but there isn't a need of total victory prior to facilitating 'edge-delivery alternatives of state/governance/authority'.\nEspecially the One Human As Master/Sovereign/Superject anywhere at all, is poison to the modern mentality, and it will probably take a long time, before it is possible to realize that. Unfortunately, because, it is - or should be - clear that \"Inequality of Leadership\" is True and also \"When aggregating leadership, then inbetween effect and compromise, noised strategies by the divergence of will/plans\".\nAnd many reasons, which you may find scattered throughout the documents.\n\nOkay, let's try with that for now."}, {"path": "system share/foundations/32. neo-colonialism.md", "title": "32. neo-colonialism.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "## 32. Neo-colonialism \u2014 A Memetic Application of 'values' and 'perspectives' won from the Polymorphic Crucible\n\n### Scope and intent\nThis document reframes neo\u2011colonialism as a memetic and political stepping-stone or partial implementation of The Crucible and formation of Triads, but in relation to 'good and also powerful countries or union of countries' exerting defacto implementation of the creation of Triads in 'bad countries', if poor memetic victory on key points, then only 'bad and also powerless countries without any grand power willing to wage war against the good+powerful countries' \n\nThe Polymorphic Crucible: Might With Right (MWR) \\[Will\u2011Economics \u2192 Crucible \u2192 MoWD \u2192 MIRA\\] to change material conditions and reduce needless suffering without requiring total legal overhaul or regime change -- It is merely the 'taking of some land' -- a lessening of the dominion to which The Host has over the land that host-persons/citizens inhabits. \nIt relies on shifting the Overton window around sovereignty, consent, human rights priorities in relation to bare-necessities; and \"the right\" to alternative governance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 1) Positioning within Foundations 27\u201329\n- 27: Sovereign Crucible and Might\u2011Is\u2011Right Alliance (MIRA awareness) \u2192 sovereign Daemonia, visible authority, stratified peace.\n- 28: Metagame of World Dynamics (MoWD) \u2192 Societal and Inter-societal Order becoming dynamic. Thus it also serves as a bridge from law/diplomacy to structured competition. What 'games' do they play to make one have and the other not. What 'games' do they play in order to dominate each other. What 'games' do they play to take and own. ('Profit Margin Merchantism' game. Or 'Money Making or Manufacturing' games. Or 'Visionary into Loan into Ponzi scheme of Visionary Abstraction' games. 'War Games taking of land and booty'. 'Video Games' or 'Chess' or 'Cures for diseases' games or 'lasting creation' games or 'popularity' games or 'popularity of political package and debates and candidates' games and so on. )\n- 29 (+29a): Might\u2011With\u2011Right MWR gradient \u2192 \n    1) Useful quadpartitioning of 'rightful' domination: will-manifestation capacity and its relation to hyper-facilitated will-coalescence (which has a subset known as: \"voluntary exchange\")\n    2) Chosen governance or explicit 'authority' (dominance by dominus in dominum; Da DDD), \n    3) Competition in 'a game' as the only contracts, \n    4) No-game complementary space and raw causality. Including a key perspective on how to deal with that: MIRA.\n\nNeo\u2011colonialism in this sense is a practical implementation of Level 4 with 'sufficient justification to avoid war-escalation' such that one can facilitate MWR order of the previous Levels 1\u20133. In part also to avoid chaotic or rightless domination including all of Level 4 without having the justification behind the progression from 1 to 4; against the host-persons by The Host. \nThus creating opt\u2011in alternatives where populations/host-persons can become Subjects of a visible Superject by consent, in bounded dominions with exit or whatever 'internal organization that The Neo-Colonialist/Superject/Authority/Dominus provides (Again: Could be these systems in whole or in part).\n\nIt is worth noting, that within such a Neo-colony, Then it is quite more reasonable to implement much more of The Polymorphic crucible or merely the Governance part of The Crucible within it. As the justification to take is outside a general Triad creation framework -- i.e. having won the world -- but instead only requires internal Authority stability concerns.\n\n## 2) Core claim\nNeo-colonialism is a wedge or bootstrapping of the creation of Triads in 'bad countries' where 'host-persons' wish to have a Triad/alternative-governance/governant 'edge-delivered'.\n\nIt is a stepping stone and proof of concept, dealing with 'badness 4000' of the world.\n\nNeo\u2011colonialism is not primarily technological nor dependent on prior legal hegemony. It is a memetic permission structure: normalize that people may choose a different Dominus/Dominion if a transparent authority offers a superior stack (law, services, ethos) and the host polity allows bounded land under treaty or charter. Overton movement first; implementation second.\n\n## 3) Sovereignty: Superjects and Subjects. Honest 'Governance' or 'Total (Lawful) Domination'.\n- Superject: the visible sovereign/authority assuming command and thus sole responsibility for a bounded dominion.\n- Subjects: persons who opt into that dominion and can exit.\n- Dominion: the scope (land, law, service stack, persons-while-in-higher-consent-subordination/subject) disclosed ex ante.\n\nHonesty replaces abstraction: rather than masked power under shifting offices, the Dominus is known. Consent is meaningful because alternatives exist and exit is protected. Complaint becomes choice: stay, leave, or found.\n\nAs hinted to in the MoWD description from before, it is quite possible, to create elaborate games of person-to-person interaction that creates elaborate governance structures and ways in which to rise and fall in positioning of command within a Triad.\n\nA Sovereignty may implement 'whatever game' they wish to 'order' all that is 'below' or subject to him/her/it \u2666|\u2663.\n\n## 4) Mechanism: Carving Alternatives without sufficient antithetical memetics for the need of physical altercations and sufficient weakness or unwilling or incapability of mobilizing physical opposition to the Conquest of Territory -- for or else only justified by some host-persons. \nHere one can make some clear distinctions after the above step has been taken.\nNamely. Within the conquered territory, what kind of authority does almost all the governance but the 'root authority' aspect (similar to The People in US or The King in democratic-monarchies of Europe).\nThat is, after a neo-colony has been established with some root-authority/sovereign/superject/dominus \u2666\u2663, then the internals of that root needs to be structured and present order.\nHere a key concern presents itself, namely whether the Host-persons should be able to choose between 'their own governance' or 'governance by the neo-colonialists'.\nWhen one provides merely the creation of 'new land with governance for some host-persons, but with a root-authority of neo-colonialist (Triad in The Crucible)', then it can be viewed as having de facto merely established a 'Safe Haven for plurality for the Host-Persons'.\nWhereas, if one provides 'new land with governance by neo-colonialists' then it can be viewed as standard Colonialism or a Colony.\nThus in short, though both fundamentally or truthfully in its root is colonialism/neo-colonialism, then we may refer to the two varieties in intuitive language as Safe Havens and Colonies within the framework of Neo-colonialism.\n\n*Note: It is wishful thinking to believe host-persons able to oppose The Host and establish their own Triad. Without MUCH MORE memetic victory in the bag. Which will incur many more years of persons in 'unacceptable conditions' including the unnecessary demise of many of them. Usually such secession takes immense memetic victories and almost certain war nonetheless for enough persons to be willing to fight The Host they find themselves 'of'. Furthermore, it rarely ends well, when it does, the costs usually have been tremendous. Whether it is Hispaniola or US Independence war or Civil War or whatever else*\n\n*As, stated in recipe, it is harder to imagine The Crucible framework having won such that host-persons can simply 'Make their own Triad', it is much more reasonable that 'some great powers' can facilitate the de facto taking and proclamation with memetic or moral shift sufficient to not bring the rest of the world to come crashing down or try to crash them.*\n\nMemetic shift enables \u201cedge\u2011delivery\u201d of authority via:\n1. Some Persons 'of the Host' invitation (It is 'for them' that the 'edge-delivery' is made and thus justified; against 'The Host' as an abstraction with some persons holding office of 'it all': \"You can't have it all. They too have a claim to some of the land.\") or acquiescence to bounded charter sites (ports, corridors, parks, rewilded brownfields).\n2. Consent assembly of prospective residents/host-persons; \"non-greedy taking from 'The Host' to 'other sovereign/dominus' for the host-persons to come under\"; Thus non-greedy how? In relation to host-person concerns: territory scales with demand and ecological constraints. \n3. Publication of the authorities and the facilitating root-authority. The creation of the internal structure, including easy perusal of it by means of 'routing'. Which may include things like: constitutions, rights, revenue model, MoWD clauses for disputes with neighbors, and obviously ubiquity of 123(4?) guarantees -- including exit guarantuess implied by 3.\n\nThis is colonial in the sense of \"some group of alien/foreign persons, going to other lands, and establishing their order and claiming the land as theirs'\". \nIt is a local \"non-greedy\" transplanting of a governance stack into a host context -- possibly against consent of The Host. \nBut justified by the explicit benefit of 'host-persons', which may very well bring with it the explicit voicing and entreating request of creation of such neo-colonies by a 'root-authority'. \nIt is worth mentioning here, that the perception of 'root-authority' to 'do well' as the authority. Is expected to be highly delusional in relation to the realized ordering of 'better root-authorities' if all 'could be tried as it'.\nTherefore, if one wishes them to have real choice and opportunities, by having provided a richness and plurality of alternatives, then one should desire to argue for the unvoiced creation of such places, in non-greedy taking fashion, to allow for 'the many such neo-colonies' (Triads without having memetically won, but where it can be implemented for the betterment of the worst-off)\nIt is the exact same justification for diversity as in The Crucible or NSS documents. The Diversity Preference in Natural Selection Systems. In market terms it would be \"preference for supplying the undemanded as well; Such that it is an immediately demandable option and thus growable\".\n\n## 5) Where to begin (Overton before bulldozers)\n- Succinct Sentence (SS): \"First facilitate Survival and escape, then squabble unfair and injust.\". Priorities of Human Rights and International Rights. To facilitate the end of extreme suffering and unnecessary deaths. By daring to state the unaccetable inaqequacies of other nations or persons in their rule or co-inhabiting-interaction. Then instead of demanding 'others'/'they' 'fix it' with some 'giving of resources to facilitate their empowerment to better do it' (Which has been tried for centuries). Then instead, one simply provides the alternative against 'The Law' of 'The Host' and 'The International Community' and 'Human Rights' (123 is all we say, rest is up for grabs for subjective valuations of 'this over that').\n\n## 6) Further Memetic attacks\n- Normalize the sentence: \u201cYou may become Subject (Substratum/Subject) of X (Sovereign/Superject) under X's command (Horn symbolism) proclaimed as Y (Halo symbolism), if you prefer X\u2019s dominion.\u201d (Reality of Power; turned into a feature by system design)\n- Instead of International Community and their Laws as the root-world-organizing perspective; Then Teach the gradient: Will\u2011Economics \u2192 Crucible \u2192 MoWD \u2192 MIRA. Escalate only as needed. (Which may result in MoWD state of their current international community laws, though probably most will not like that when they can make alternatives with much more dynamism and creativity and so on. To live with weight of world momumental historical consequences without the collateral and casualties otherwise present).\n- Popularize visible sovereignty: name the Sovereign/Dominus(If you really like to emphasize the tastyness of unleashing the part of human existence and will, with all the emotional treasure; called: Domination. Will OVER Will. (The Experimental Opposition to the \"Universal Suffrage Idea\": Diversity Preference including Will OVER Will, then WHO.)); publish the Dominion; show the ledger of consent.\n- Aim for Plurality of Neo-colonial 'root-authorities', such that the overall Natural Selection Systems Polymorphic Crucible effects can bring about the realization of 'The Better than Old-World' 'Triads'/Neo-colonies. That is, allow for as many candidates in the amorality view of NSS. You are not to judge beyond 1234 in terms of 'trying out'. It is up to holistic selection by each and everyone single person. In neo-colonial setting: Host-persons and potentially also settler-persons (If settlers really enjoy it, then it seems like pettiness not to allow it, and it seems reasonable to assume that it possesses some truth of 'establishing a good life and place' on the planet. Thus the diversity preference is beyond justfied for them.)\n- Showcase pilots: micro\u2011sites without clear metrics, metrics make persons blind: Instead of viewing the thing in all its complexity, they instead reduce it to a number and delusionally rank things according to it. The case in point example is in the sexual market and metrics concerning that. Take as an example Height or Income or Breast Size or Hair Colour. \nWhat to do instead of metrics? Showcase it. As it is. Allow for visitation and trial periods too. It is mutual agreement or consent in being part of a Triad. Once Aiddaemons kick in, then obviously, whatever fully human-comprehensible metrization you have made, it will be extremely shallow and corruptive in terms of accuracy of fit between a person and potential Triads. (The human understanding of 'fit' is through Aiddaemon mirroring, contextualization and to-human encoding schemes including whatever private language created between them (neologies))\n\n## 7) Relation to Triads and local founding\nIdeal end\u2011state is Triadization of The World and in harmony of Fractally expressed World-Will envisioned Beauty and Richness with massive adaptiveness and evolving dynamism to create a massive stage for eternally unfolding history. \nIn many states, powerholders block this. Neo\u2011colonialism bootstraps alternatives by importing a ready Sovereign stack under Level 4 considerations which may be entreatied, creating a mighty beachhead of consented order. \nOver time, local Triads can fork, inherit, power-struggle for the land (MWR) or disembark from the mandate.\n*Note: Non-greedy taking (Never be THAT bad.) and Priorities (Removes THAT BAD), First Survival and escape, THEN \"unfair and Injust\".Including MWR dynamism to follow. Which allows for an escape from the hopeless position. 'Anything (\u00ac123) is Possible by framework'.* \n\n## 8) Ethical guardrails (non\u2011negotiable)\n- Forced displacement often provokes strong opposition from third-parties, thus it is strongly discouraged to do when the memetic victories aren't won concerning 'purity' or 'snow' 'static' 'tv-noise' heterogeneity versus world-pictures and colours swirling etc.\nThe way displacement usually functions without much opposition, is through 'migration of that which ruins some locality for you'. \n- Root-authority, may implement whatever they wish as the internal structure. It may include the modern piety talk: \"Due process and equal dignity; no collective punishment nor discrimination based on immutable traits.\". And it may include the opposite of it: \"Judgement by Sovereign without verbalized justification, 'whim of will process'; total inequality and in relation to dignity; collective punishment is always had, you have a cost on creatures like you, learning patterns from similar organisms and subsequent lack of patience; Discrimination in all things. If you can discern a difference or distinction then it is perhaps a good idea to let it perturb the way in which you deal with reality concerning what is different: Discrimination.\"\n- They may also include to implement unnecessary control structures down the chain in bureaucratic fashion. Instead of Plurality and NSS with PoP/PoU accountability and Trust Network Intelligence (With all externalities and intelligent PoU strategies (like random check up or automatic systems) provided by High Trustworhy actors etc etc) and Individual Navigation Empowerment by Tech Stack (Aiddaemon, LL games and other visualizations of the intelligence it can be provided); Such as: \"Independent oversight: ombuds, whistleblower protections, open data, third\u2011party audits.\"\n- It may also include such hopeless wishful thinking as Anarchy of persons from places that are already in unacceptable conditions (We humans create and destroy, when we face unaccetable conditions, it is usually that we destroy more than we create: Which is much more easy to do): \"Demilitarized mandates; policing is civilian, accountable, interoperable with host.\". And it may include the opposite: \"Total militarized zones; no weapons allowed; Only military/police of the neo-colonialists have it.\". And it may include some other human lessons from the last century and perhaps longer: \"One day the sheriff will be black\". Which is to say: Often persons want to have extreme discrimination on immutable traits and to the extend that they wish their 'state or power wielders' to be exclusive like them - especially concerning the immutable traits (Often in fear that their immutable traits may DE FACTO be used against them by the power wielder): \"Neo-colonialist Militarized Border designating the Land Taken. Then Colonist policing in Colonies and \\*Fractal-Host policing in Safe Havens.\" (\\* Host zones segmented by self-identification or need of *that kind of blackness* in their power-wielders against them. Which could be 'anything'. Like 'Only other Transsexuals' or 'Only other christians of that particular denomination'. This is the power of the self-similar structures of The Crucible. It can be divided however much you want. (You'll find it hard to solve without Land/space considerations. If you do it exclusively in spacetime considerations, then there is a greater possibility of it failing in being sufficient or working well. And if you do it in seemingly chaotic actuality settings, then of course, it seems like an almost impossible task to realize that one only deals with desired 'type' or 'type in depth' authority in otherwise intermingling in spacetime persons and authorities. (The Crucible provides the manageable variety while not in a super intelligent orchestrated coalescence reality (Imagine the Planetary zones in the far future being ONLY functioning on this coalescence reality, but still providing the capacity or benefits of the strongly designated or strongly enforced varieties or 'typed' versions of the Polymorphic Crucible (The building from not having the systems, but providing the benefit of them, allows also for fall-back states, which can then again apply the Diversity Preference (Say, in the advent of most or everything thinking Planetary Zones to be preferable to all other Triads; Then still, the Diversity Preference would argue, that it be important, that Triads of lesser order keep on existing and being 'demandable' or 'options' or 'choice' or 'opportunity' or 'variant to overtake'))))))\n\n## 9) Conflict handling (MoWD bridge)\nThe Neo-colonies are established against The Host and against The Law of both The Host and The International Community and many other written texts of 'sovereignty of The Host Abstraction over THAT LAND' and so on.\nBut, it may be possible for neo-colonies and even The Host, to do MoWD bridging concerning some things.\nAs an example, it may relate to 'more than non-greedy' beliefs and taking: \"You took all of the uninhabited Nile ranges for neo-colonies for the World to make World Alternative Opportunities for ANYONE ON THE PLANET WHO WANT OUT of the conditions they are in. That is TOO GREEDY! We will ABSOLUTE DIE ON THE HILL TO PREVENT YOU AND TAKE IT BACK!\". Which obviously, if memetic shift has happened sufficiently, results in them trying and dying. That is against our 1 aspirations. Thus, we ought to feel compelled to apply the Might With Right considerations, and figure out, how we can exercise our might against them with as much Right as possible without sacrificing lives of those who then will not have an escape and opportunity elsewhere.\nSuch a game, may be: \"You say you will die on this hill. And I believe you. But I do not wish to see you die from such a folly cause as claiming this land as yours. Therefore, we will present to you a cascade of games, in which you can take from what we had decided to take proportional to [an estimation of your claim to the land and the quantities of players willing to fight for it].\"\nThey then respond in a throng of persons: \"We will absolutely die on this hill. We will play your game, since: If we win, you leave without a fight in some territory, and we will only have to fight you in the remaining. And if we lose, then we will simply go back to waging war against you.\" (See how OUR justification for then killing them when they lose and still wish to die on the hill grows. With Right).\nTo which the neo-colonialists may respond: \"Alright, a game you shall have. Which games would you be willing to honour the worthiness of winning to the extend of letting it decide upon this matter?\"\nTo which they may respond: \"1 on 1 knife battles or same-gun battles\".\nTo which neo-colonialists respond: \"No. You're not worth us dying for.\"\nTo which they may respond: \"OMG OMGO OMG OMG OMOMG OGMO GHUMAN EQUALITY!\" or perhaps rather \"How offensive! We are definitely worth you dying for\".\nNCv1: \"What about no-rules MMA. kvk and 1v1. Where everything is allowed. From biting to eye gouging and so on.\"\nNCv2: \"What about you too get a neo-colony. Then if your place is preferred amongst the many. Then we will preferentially let you grow with some factor advantage?\"\nNCv3: \"What about whoever seems to be able to provide the most benefit by leading it get preferential starting position. A priori estimations to be proven under NSS growth and decay game?\"\nNCv4: \"What about those 'persons of the world who want to migrate to such neo-egyptian neo-colonies' a priori rally/vote to?\"\nNCv5: \"What about neo-colonialists land-grabbing segmented by share of a great \"democracy\" world-votes scheme?\"\n... And so on. You figure out a game. It could be an initial architecture competition. Or land-envisioning competition. Or vision-coalescence and orchestration of the harmony of all the neo-colonies between each other contest. It could be something about world-indebtedness in having 'given or created for the world'. (Say China, Japan, USA, and north-western-central and perhaps USSR/Russia brought modernity and all the alleviations of ailments with it. Despite it being orchestrated chaotically and in hindsight unfortunate in effect many times.)\n\nSome more general considerations that one can consider suggesting or using/commanding-internally may be:\n- Intra\u2011neo-colony disputes: Crucible law with appeal; MoWD mini\u2011games for stubborn contests; acceptable\u2011loss caps.\n- Inter\u2011neo-colony or to-host disputes: pre\u2011agreed MoWD ladders (arbitration \u2192 performance races \u2192 corridor swaps), keeping Level\u20114 escalation off the table.\n\n## 10) Allocation and reciprocity\n- Demand\u2011bounded land: proportional area to consenting residents and infrastructure; strict ecological floors. The alternatives could be 'at a whim' root-authority Oxymoronic Halo. And it could be \"Towards Vision and deemed Beautiful by ...\".\n- Revenue: lease/tax sharing with host is a bad idea as it adds a layer of parasitism due to some 'lawfulness' that is counter to what is Right; And What is Right is simply taken by outrageously superior Might position (Why can I state outrageously superior Might position? I am optimistic now: \"Coalescence around what is Right! Third Parties and finding better games than disrupting each other.\"); restitution/insurance pools for externalities.\n- \"Reciprocity: training compacts, supplier development, and open procurement to uplift the host economy\" is a terrible idea, since The Host had proven itself to be \"The Worst\" or \"Badness unacceptable\". Therefore artifically patching their massive flaws is a terribly bad idea. It is the antithesis of NSS. Perhaps, that really deserves emphasis somewhere: When you EMPOWER someone discriminately, then consider WHY THEM. If you do, merely because they keep failing, then probably they are not the best ones to be empowered and pull the rest out of it. And contrapositively, if you find some persons ruling that REALLY pulled the rest up, then probably they are the ones you should discriminately empower. (It is a presupposition of 'edge-delivery of Sovereignty'/neo-colonies and neo-colonialism at large: That it may very well be hugely beneficial to outsource authority to 'someone else some place for some persons'. Which further has the inequality of ability to lead presuppostion) Then remember: Diversity Preference. Which suggests facilitation for anyone to try it out. And also indiscriminate empowerment, as in the case of sharing these sytems and perhaps open-sourcing some tech-stack parts and so on.\n\n## 11) Implementation sketch\n1. Green paper: Amoral Metaframework though attempt at seeing if MBC can be had. Diversity outside even MIRA aimed for in terms of neo-colonies (It isn't POWER RACE but instead subjective preference/rally of Triad diversity aim here.). Nice routing tree to plug into as a colony or safe haven; Which may include such things as 'constitution equivalents', rights (charters), metrics/showcasing/storytelling-without-lies/vision-allurement, MoWD context. (And REMEMEBER! It is AMORAL! And DIVERSITY PREFERENCE. Therefore, yes, THEY TOO and WITH THAT ROUTING OR VISION THEY HAVE IN MIND. You are not to DENY the attempt at manifesting something someone wants; That others may choose to rally to. You are to keep your opinionated dominating fat ass out of the dreaming of other persons; and allow them too, to live and try their will and dreams. So, if they want, a neo-egyptian neo-colony that is ONLY Chinese Men and Pygmy Black Women allowed. Then that is simply none of your business, and it may prove that they can find few rallying persons to it, and it may be they can. Not your business. (\"And the Pygmy men saw their women abandoning their lands\" (I have tried to raise concern about these things for decades. It is what it is. SOIL FOR BLOOD. Allows for \"If only ONE chooses us. Then we can Phoenix\". Which has been GLEEFULLY and in FULL VITRIOL LOVED TO DENY IT. Laughed and mocked and called pathetic and so on. So, I don't want to hear it. (This is LITERALLY the reason I made this system. To ALLOW FOR SOME SOIL FOR ANY BLOOD TO SURVIVE THROUGH HAVING HABITAT THAT ISN'T CONQUERED THROUGH COVER OF ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS AND RATIONALIZATIONS.(The degree of having to wrap that desire to let human kinds exist in kind through habitat that isn't shadily serpentiled rationalized as good to allow conquered and them destroyed (Blood and Soil is the gold nugget that is suddenly allowed in this system -- Through total post modern subjectivity that then turns around and allows also for real things to matter: Like Life on the Planet or being allowed to have a Home that suits you and isn't up for change by the will of outsiders or some large union you happen to be part of that feels justified in dominating into destruction that home of yours (And no, your home isn't thousands of square miles, it is tangibly and traversable in human terms a place. Then you also have places that are dear to you. And the extreme cases could be holy sites in Israel etc. And it serves as a good example on how to deal with those things. And the paradox of \"home and place dear to many\" and how to resolve that. (And dear to many in mutual existence of the place. Like al-aqsa mosque and Third Temple; or in soft variety version: Sophia Hagia or other such places (Eastern Roman or Orthodox christianity or perhaps Christianity most important Church; while simultaneously the treasured conquest prize by the Caliphate and city highlight of Istanbul (Whether these things can be solved in MWR 1, actuality, timeshare or unfolding dynamism (extreme example: al-aqsa for n years more. Then demolished or built upon it The Third Temple) or MWR 2 \"you get that. We get this.\" or MWR 3 \"These games changes who owns it; and the rules of how they may change it while owning it; and commitment to keep Metagame alive aka always there must be an ongoing game, but the game is up for change\" or MWR 4 \"We will find a way to have it. There will be no back and forth. It shall be ours. No matter how much time it will take us to be able to manifest in reality the overpowering of you sufficient for our risk aversion.\"))))))))))\n2. One could create some layer beneath the neo-colonialist 'root-authorities' (Which will probably be Militaries and whoever controls them; Those that actually have the Horns/Golden-Laurels/Laurels to create the membrane of safety within and strength against any outsider) Where there exists a guiding tool that is composed of \"Independent review panel (law, ethics, ecology, security, econ)\". Or whatever 'advisory' or 'wisdom' effect one seeks; and for use as 'justification in acting one or the other way': \"Scientists agree!\" or \"Independent Research Corporation was employed to ..\" or \"Expert Witness of category P.Hd. Vouche for or estimates in favour of or states change of projective space and assuming random results in frequentists probability stating less than one in twenty instantiations would see such data of projective space\".\n3. Select 1\u20133 edge sites with strong local consent for using some of the land their 'The Host' claims dominion over; Then implement it, to facilitate the escape of anyone on the planet with too much 'badness' in 123 terms or else even simply in their own estimation (Though, it will have way less effect fixing the hell of someone everyone else agrees ought to believe themselves in paradise or some good state; Therefore, fixing things like: Massive child abuse. Or killing worlds. Or lots of unnecessary deaths. Or famine. Or nutrional diseases (including fatness deaths (They need domination or else restricted environment in terms of pollution and enticement towards their appetite weaknesses))). Then having shown 'the fruits' in terms of 'badness removal', then perhaps, it will be believed that allowing domination too within this framework and towards \"a stubborn singular subjective vision in total purity\" is enriching the world and provides true opportunity and distinctive alternatives, which can then include the sense of 'perfect fits'.\n4. Financing it! There exists many ways of financing it. \n    a) \"Deliver us\" euphoria and voluntary dedication of finally having found 'them' and 'the home' in which you can build it; and escape the tyranny and suffering. This provides a strong impetus of work, wealth or at least effort.\n    b) \"Escape from what you want out of, yes. But under these work-makes-it-possible conditions.\". Where 'slavery exists' in this lower-consent-violating format.\n    c) \"Sufficient justification of 'somewhere free' not having gone into gooey eyed kumbaya mode yet\" Which allows for the utilization of prisoners into work-camps that eventually should see them freed into some parts they have created and constructed.\n    This is NOT GULAG: 123 MBC. AT LEAST. (Also, whether this happens or not. Oh well. I like to take a step back. Then look not in terms of subjectivity. But in terms of ant-colony. At least sometimes. Who does what. Not why. Who are the worker-ants. Then I add in the flavour of \"Who deserves to rest and enjoy. Who deserves to work not only for themselves. At least for a while.\". And in that analysis: Holy. Fuck. The. World. Sucks. Which is to say: I don't mind this bullet point at all. But I have to be careful in how emphatic I am about it. Because it has extremely bad or otherwise well demonized precedents in the same category. Whether it is Auschwitz et. al. \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" or it is USSR Gulag precedents in the same category. Whether it is Auschwitz Arbeit Macht Frei or it is USSR Gulags.)\n    d) General desire of the world to be altruistic and facilitate the escape of persons without destroying or changing their homes.\n    e) High Leverage Terraformers -- wanting to make their mark upon the planet with grand pioneering.\n    f) States or other institutional extractive powers. Or parasitism of The Now as the world \"is\". Who may wish to not part their wealth to 'others', but instead help bring about some better embeddedness, even if it ultimately would reduce their position in the more responsive or person-competitive environments.\n    g) Vision-coalescence. Some person makes some artistic enviosioning of a neo-colony/colony/safe-haven; And he/she/it finds abundant 'crowd-funding' for it or even rallying-pioneers; who then 'bring about the material change to that place'.\n5. Renewal is the key side-effect of NSS or concerning neo-colonies\\[\\{colony/safe-haven\\}/triad\\] rally 'holistic alternative governance/triad choices by each individual'. Fork 'root-authority' schemes. Temporal considerations of limited space or resources while in the light of Diversity Preference; Who first, how long with funding, how long with space to grow without rallying and so on.\n\n## 12) Why this reduces suffering and death and provides almost immediately real alternatives that feel like opportunities for persons \nwho for some reason; do not fit the mold somewhere: Pioneering alternative space for yourself and those like it who need it even more. \nBy allowing honest, rightful domination within bounded domains, people gain real alternatives to stasis, predation, or despair. \nCompetition among sovereignties occurs on 'subjective valuation of it' and the 'experience of it'. Which may also include safety; sense of belonging to persons, culture and place; belief in the benevolence and justice of the authority; services, law, and ethos. The memetic permission to choose a Dominum even with a Dominus rather than merely a oxymoronic sovereign while others wield authority  in the name of such sovereignty - liquefies trapped conflict and channels it into structured, measurable improvements.\n\nThere is an interesting case to be made, concerning countries where mutually assured or powerful might is present.\nThey may choose to oppose any neo-colonial creation within their Land/Dominion. Though, it may then have the consequences of persons within their country, over time, becoming upset, that there is no alternatives to their governance. Which, perhaps results in sufficient pressure for a forking or a anti-federalization of most aspects to their current governance -- to allow for a segmentation on the lines of discontent.\nThis is, of course, only the case when there is 'powerful military backing to make taking of land for neo-colonies costly'.\nWhich is to say: Due to the cold war weapon race (Propaganda -> Revolution -> Arming and Civil War -> Sending in troops against the other winning side. (Examples stretch from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Iraq to african countries and so on)) and military industrial complex (Selling raw might for bananas; because individual benefit by having more bananas to attract brain-n-worker-mercenaries and buy resources; against other corporations also trying the same), most places are 'too costly' to simply take from.\n(Though it is quite easy -- once the developed countries could agree -- to simply stop empowering in raw might anyone else. Then compete in more honest terms on their own capacity to race ahead. Or perhaps view the benefit of not having empowered everyone else as greater, than the mercenary attractiveness added by selling weapons or winning a country to your sphere of interest in the first v second world cold war. Once you stop empowering others, then of course, we're on a trajectory of automated or at least remote-controlled (more safe trajectory than LAWs) robotic warfare. Where one then can accept non-lethal weaponry, as the the \"casualties\" are only costs and not persons. That is, raw economic prowess becomes the ability to Might With Right (No casualties only costs) But it takes doing a variety of MIRA on account of 'those who can drive weapon tech stack' to simply agree not to undermine each other by selling power / raw might to others. Which everyone else can of course try to work against anyone who does. Equality of One Code as Nuclear Codes is a bad idea. Equality of gun shot is a bad idea when the burglar approaches you with a pointy knife and ski-mask on.)\n\n## 13) Minimal glossary for neo-colonialism. (Which may be replaced with terminology from The Crucible)\n- Sovereign/Superject/Dominus/Colonel: the visible sovereign offering a governance stack.\n- Subject: a consenting resident within the dominion.\n- Dominion: bounded scope of law/services/land.\n- Neo-colonialism as Boostrapping The Crucible by Level 4 taking MWR then implementing below; such that one can have their chosen governance as a \\[colony/safe-haven\\]/Triad.\n- MoWD: structured competition frameworks; the bridge from law to might.\n- MIRA: no-rules raw causality and considerations; the level to avoid by succeeding at 1\u20133.\n\n## 14) Closing\nNeo\u2011colonialism, reframed through the Polymorphic Crucible, aims at being a peaceful technique for removing 'the worst' and offering a trajectory for 'the best': move minds first so that hosts is incapable of presenting world-power opposition sufficient to attack the taken places; Let rally-performance or will-performance or will-economics or MoWD or ...; MWR renewal (always aim at finding Right to exercise Might); diversity preference; and nesting-domination (also known as rights) guardrail & decide what scales. \n\n**Where it works, it grows. Where it fails, it dwindles.**\n\n\n\n## 15) Operational annex \u2014 consent, exit, routing, and ladders\n\nThis section offers concrete, minimally prescriptive mechanics that preserve the aims of \\[MWR; diversity preference; non-greedy taking;\\] while making neo-colonies legible enough to launch and evolve.\n\n### 15.1 Consent and exit mechanics (Subject <-> Superject)\n- Consent ledger (minimal schema), the idea of having an automated and trust/trustless authority provability of when consent or the retraction of consent was at least documented in the system, and in a particular technological implementation method: SubjectId; Triad/neo-colony Id; consent-version hash; timestamp; residency-status (prospective|resident|exiting|exited); obligations snapshot; exit-window; ombuds-case-id (optional). Tech stack current available could allow you to make the choice in the space of ano-pseudo-person ID as a choice between: privacy-preserving proofs rather than public PII. Later you may gain anonymity through other avenues than privacy preserving proofs and you may gain pseudo to personal identity identification through other means than Public PIIs. As an example, you may be known by 'anything', the standard fingerprinting ideas and so on.\n- Exit protocol (defaults):\n  - Notice \u2192 settlement window (debts(doesn't exist)/assets(Are yours; dumb if you placed them in land you don't own; dumb way to pretend ownership when there is obvious pwnership behind it; like in most states today, where the may suddenly say: expropriation or nationalization or forceful auctioning (Note: This isn't so much a concern, when your aim, becomes World building and exploration. Which is what is expected. Then most persons become semi-nomadic, where their ownership is virtual and quite often existing in relation to beliefs of other persons and the degree to which they will let you 'act as if you owned it'(The having 'a house' and 'making your nest out of it' is a tired dream by now. Perhaps some will keep that as their full investment. But many will probably find quite a different adventurous life to embark upon)))/utilities) \u2192 duty-of-care handoff (host, alternative Triad, or neutral corridor) \u2192 exit confirmation on ledger.\n  - Positional instead of Personal hierarchy of responsibilities and constraint authority within domains and according to scripture/law/rules, could then suggest a internal organization like: \"No-retaliation covenant; access to ombuds if exit is impeded.\".\n  Whereas, if one does Personal hierarchy of Authority without domains nor anything but law as guide. Then it is merely a 'bubble-up' process to 'complain' and usually the 'settlement' isn't debate or discussion or a judgement with a winner (though it can be), but often it is simply pre-emptied by divergence of the parties involved; If the parties are in a superject-subject (nested) position, then the bubble-up mechanics from The Crucible.\n  - Total misunderstanding of contracts becoming illegal, and instead replaced with MoWD. \"Renewal cadence (e.g., annual re-consent) to keep legitimacy alive rather than presumed.\". There isn't any binding consent at all, ever, outside MoWD games where Level 1 or Level 2 can't suffice. With Level 1, you simply do in coalescence and reach will-equilibrium, behaving in certain ways results in certain predictive consequences all things considered; as well as personal belief perturbations and pattern amplification and application by Aiddaemon onto 'that which is similar' (Think prediction. That's all. To learn from data you must make some sort of equality or proximity assessment of things. Otherwise every encounter or thing is totally without any prior information. Prejudice or whatever you want to call it. Discrimination. Discernment. But the general version and bound to prediction or human subjectivity \"If it matters it matters\" like The Sheriff is black (perhaps because \"When the suspect is black\" (If you believe Black versus White a good analysis with high information and predictive power. Then you'd see, even in low-dimensional bayesian analysis (Incomplete data (distance in projective space was 0.1 and 0.7 respectively, but adding that dimension suddenly it became 100000 instead of 0.1 and 0.8 instead of 0.7 (Say, some distance to your empathy and aversion to killing others, white and black initially, then adding 'known serial killer' dimension. And such things. Point being: White v Black is extreme massive aggregate of things of reality. It is low-dimension name that has many causalities (due to life reproduction) but also do not, due to massive genetic divergencies within the clusters, and individual mutations and environmental paths lived and chosen throughout life: AND SO ON... Suffice to say: Prediction 'all things considered' results in 'things being named equal or proximate' in relation to some will-topology of some person.(Equal here refers to some functional equality, like \"Someone I would not want to invite into my house. With the limited timespace vicinity I have. They fall squarely outside a desire of proximity ever, all persons and beings or peace alone considered.\" or the standard crucible version \"Not suitable for my/this Triad\" category/class/classification (Not static, but, they 'do not belong' is the prediction. Which one of course can overwrite and ignore and still try out... (Aka. This is bordering the proof of equality is a mental construct, or projection possibility property, all there exists is inequality 'all things considered' (If you want some physics variety of it: No Cloning Theorem.)))))))))).\n\n### 15.2 Routing and interoperability (nesting clarity)\n- Naming: \n    1) The foundations suggested variety of doing Atlas of symbols and later Aiddaemon parsing of it: Translating in private or contextualized language of a person. This makes the \"TriadCode\" unique not by enforcement or numeric-conversion or hashing or whatever else, but by its distinction. It includes \u2663\\_{anonimity-tag/pseudonym-id/ID} or \u2666\\_{..} as the center Sovereignty designation. See TODO: insert link to Crucible Routing documents and relevant sections therein.\n    2) Or alternatively what you want to spin up that is manageable to you and yours. Like that of: TriadCode.Dominion.Path (human legible), plus stable IDs for machine use.\n- Triad/Colony/SafeHaven and their Services discovery:\n    1) Foundations suggest Trust Network intelligence of 'fit' including Aiddaemonic simulations; or gaming the experience in VR or VR-AR mix (They are there in AR and you experience theirs' there through VR); or watching a medley of suggested places or places that predict you a good match (Your choice how much to share to others, or as discussed in Aiddaemonic simulation secrecy through Third Party trusted to forget and so on. Also, other's of course have eyes and can 'learn' to their own capacity or ability. You become dominator of the world to prevent it :P \"THOU SHALT HAVE NO EYES NOR MIND TO REMEMBER ME!\" or \"My right of privacy overwrites your write of mind integrity!\"). \n    2) Perhaps a way for a nation state or corporation (able to hire military might to establish neo-colony). Might find it easy to implement something like: \"canonical registry of authorities, rulesets, and contact points per zone; immutable archive of rule changes.\"\n- Inheritance \n    1) Foundations suggest to enforce inheritance. This is because, it makes routing easily naviagable as a side-effect of having spatial coherence and stability or gradient changes: \"Going into this Triad highest scale or largest zone that encapsulate the rest of them. Tells me these rules and laws and leaders/sovereign. Then I stumble upon a lower scale zone/triad nested. Well, all I need to know is what they add to it.\". This is useful not only in world organization ensuring coherence which could be believed to be harmonizing. But also it is useful in segmentation on divergence. Forking sharding or disbarking. And so on. If you can't agree on a \"Ubiquity Law\" Then there is a fundamental issue in talking about having a \"Union\" or Nesting. If you can, then that can be the highest largest scale nest. Then you add as you go down the stream. If you remove, then it doesn't belong at that level, but should be lateral branching instead of nesting relative to the alternatives. The fork happened too late so too speak in the segmentation or nesting branching of the root or largest scale Triad.\n    2) In case, that is annoying for some reason: You're the boss, do as you want, as an example: Clearly mark what is inherited from the root authority vs. what is devolved to subzones; publish a single-page \u201cchain of command\u201d. Authority becomes clear. No doubt about \"The People\" if that is your Sovereign \u2666\\_{[function/system aggregator of:]\u2663s_{Pointer To List of Persons that is \"The People\"}}, then there will be no doubt that those \u2663s can apply the \u2666 at any time they wish. They are the root-authority.\n    The typical \"democractic\" variety is something like \u2666\\_{[every 4 years you get a vote for persons who have social node domination through club and PR for it being a choice that isn't waste of vote to vote for. The persons who get to use this system sovereign is]\u2663s\\_{Pointer to paper citizen stamp or ability to bring a ballot into vote state} which causes another \u2663s\\_{Who achieved vote sufficiency to implement laws or wield executive power}}+\u2663s\\_{Persons who have climbed to position hierarchy to wield their authority which is justified by the former system, though not being of it.}. Or something like it. It is wholly insane and not at all Demos that Rule.. Gone over it many times what it really is in relation to Democracy. It is antithetical to it. Used to take the name of The People against any group or person of The People to have any power anywhere. Or in principle and de facto that is them and their system. \"You are ALL THE PEOPLE!\" is another lying assumption, that accounts for no reality of A People, nor any subjectivity of The People, but instead says: If Process and Bureaucrat has paper stamped you, THEN The People as only objective truth. Any stating of A People outside that is a lie that receives only the tag of potential terrorists and insurgencies. All of this simply goes away, if you are not yourself delusional about it, in the new systems. So to speak: You get what you tolerate. Or: You suffer your beliefs. Or: Live your Philosophy. The Crucible truths of 'any psychosis' revealed or melted and brought about.\n\n### 15.3 Non\u2011greedy taking heuristic (demand\u2011bounded)\n- Territory scales with: \n    a) MWR. As an example Level 1 through 4.\n        1) Start with World Will subjectivity of all and the will-economic realities. This is the better 'market and democracy' or 'inverted pyramid' knowledge and determinator of it. That is able to factor in, with cause and effect realities the cost of doing equality assumptions like \"one person one vote for any one globally\". Or things like: In full will-economy with no assumption: What becomes. TODO: fix these links; See [Will-manifestation] and [Heidegger] or where I wrote about high-lever terraformers. \n        2) Realize that establishing the land grabbing requires certain Might. In this case without global consensus, but instead neo-colonialism instead of Triadization. Then it is a matter of 'those that can' become root-authority. (Which may be a MIRA alliance agreeing to facilitate neo-egyptian neo-colonialism). This allows for the hardline chain of authority by being the Horns (often only through golden laurels of military or nation state or union of such entities 'position head' or 'first among equals': The Horns present are only through some Crown or Golden Laurel able to be collective Horny enough to be that formidable power). This reality, related to 4) then causes a 'root-authority' as Sovereign in some neo-colony, which causes a cascade effect of his/her rule or oxymoronic lack of rule as ruler. Like democratic monarchies of Europe.\n        3) MoWD games in nested fashion of the established neo-colony. To decide certain dynamism or redistribution/conquest of zero-sum resources like land.\n        4) This is basically 2, but then in relation to establishing neo-colonies continually.

(b) essential infrastructure; (c) ecological floors. Publish a simple justification memo for each expansion. All of this is proclamation or Halo or System rule. Which can be alright. But the reality remains, and is suggested clearly designated by the initial root routing name of the neo-colony and internal organization dynamics.\n- Displacement risk threshold: \n    a) This is usually not considered a crime in principle. Only in means of achieving it. It is generally lauded as 'change' and being 'good'. The mantra here is: \"Non-greedy taking\" and MWR considerations. (Which is the opposite of the standard morality of today. Where extinction and taking of 100% leaving nothing at all is considered laughably evil to oppose or voice concern against. Usually through very retarded persons who have demonized existence to the point of flashing Devil imagery at any notion of human life or having a place for 'yours'. Which if turned around at this point, leaves no one who faces neo-colonialism any land at all to hold onto with justification. Their opposition would be laughably evil too. (We're not like them. We're so much better. So. And that is one dimension of viewing who deserves more or less, or to rule over others or not (Anyway. There isn't much to say other than these systems allows for total divergence and separation. In actuality. In Worlds. And so on. So one can 'go free' and forge one's own destiny and 'be happy'.

And it goes for anyone about anything and their empowerment to incur costs to diverge from it or against it TODO: see relevant documents.

Then lots of irrigation into massive zones surrounding it. For the utility of anyone on the planet wishing to escape into massive richness in opportunity of governance and way of life; or safety in relation to exposure to 'types of other persons'.

LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU!\"\nWill exists in 'limited free roam' positions of the world. The Old World Version: Simple segmentation of the lands and sorting of persons under the guise of Fascism.\nIn the new world: Triadic Nesting and 'Where you're invited/allowed'.\n\n\n\nAnother \"weight of your crowns\": See [Removal of Men By Force And Fascism](34.%20Removal%20of%20Men%20by%20force%20under%20cover%20of%20fascism.md).\n    Will be the 'random acts of the unacceptable'. Whether it is rape of our women or girls. Or acid attacks. Or killings. Or malevolent beatings or with great negative outcomes forseeable. All of this: No. Fucking. More. We do the crime of having \"cell membranes\"/borders between different regions of \"the world\" or \"our world\" or \"your world\". Will make it all drop to zero in a month. Which is at least some thousands a month saved from death. And many more rape and beatings that has brain-impact.\n    Then with Triads The Crucible suicide will drop.\n    And with submission of power persons across the planet: lifestyle stuff will drop massively. Since business can no longer \"win in the market\" by accepting to make their products poisonous or inflict plaguing damage to the land and persons in it.\n\n\nIt sounds rough. But, life is simply more interesting with a bit more \"spice\" -- \"some baddies\" -- Willing to wear the evil fascist garments and 'separate into bordered zones ala hunger games persons who might be dangerous to each other'. Then see crime drop to 0 for most zones. Those where it keeps on happening: They will be able to fractally segment themselves until they too can have peace..\n\nNow. You don't have to do it. Because, you may be willing to sacrifice some persons in the background-threat level that is, in order to not do anything \"impure\" or \"evil\" yourself. And so, you can choose that avenue, and cowards usually do, and has done for most of history -- That dear reputation and re-electabiliity and gregariability.\n\nIt is easy in places like Denmark, because we have so many Islands. We can simply use some Islands for 'dangerous persons' to segment themselves, but otherwise be free in. Then any sort of kind may designate their own. And almost instantly everyone else could be 'free' and 'safe'.\n\nThen the burden of proof and the side-of-error favours the victim rather than the suspicious subjects or would-be-perpetrators.\nI have a perspective of these things like this: To live in a world, where everything you love is uprooted and shown to be your traitorous enemies, when it is allowed invaded and transformed into a violent conquered zone. When you're unable to find any place to call 'your own' because you are unable to lower yourself to mere mercenary status and work on myopic will of retard-money-men to fail to 'meet the standards of utility to money-flow or masses'.\nAnd even if you choose to do that to \"survive\" you'll be judged on \"time investment and facade nurturing\" schooling and cv and connections.\nIt becomes a full-time endeavour to gain almost anything at all. And hard or impossible to find profit in doing what is right -- Whether employed or 'starting your own business'. \n\n\"Manifest Abundance\" by marketing (See [Critique of The West](./a_critique_of_the_west.md))\n\"Wealth of Nations\" by GDP.\n\nIt can't possibly get anymore clown retarded.\n\nThen it falls on deaf ears to hear someone complain that they be given soil somewhere to live freely (Free Roam persons can go to them, but they can't go to Free Roam (In Crucible Terminology: \"You are confined to your Lake and below; The Sea and Ocean is off limits; The World and Planet is open to you as well\" as an example.)) as a 'punishment' that in its totality will prevent almost all murder, rape and extreme violence.\n(The Domestic Killing aspect: You can predict these things easily........ And there are many ways to deal with it: One is having fraternity. Another is: New Woman. A third is: Don't make anyone able to lose 'everything' and a fourth is: Removal of Dangerous Elements in general also removes a large overlap with domestic killing. So I wager it is almost all murder by this addition. (You may say: Oh the crime of 'new woman'. But it's okay, OnlyFans and Porn (Prositution). One could, if you wanted, simply use prostitutes as a 'noble preventive utility nobody knows about' -- A secret intelligence service or police service, that basically hooks up when it is going haywire... Vents the valve. You can call this idea impure and ugly. I don't care, it is a way to alleviate that edge of despair and anger in extremely tense situations without 'capturing the person who has become dangerous and removing him from the free roam world' (He may otherwise lose also \"his world\", after having \"lost what he thought was everything\", so unless \"the world he gains when losing the free roam world is a vast upgrade fraternity wholesomeness, then it may cause even more despair and 'lashing out or in'. Also, It may very well be that a woman **can be** a 'heinous bitch' (do things that makes another lose too much and hurts them too much) and totally and in full psychopathy ruin a 'normal man' to the point of him being willing to hurt her physically (... All I'm saying... This is a 'solution' -- Basically secret service is their pimp. And they 'temporarily fix the passion domestic killing issue in many cases'. Or in NSS rethoric: You don't know if it works or not, but morality prevents you from doing it. Because you are 'pure' you accept evil. When you're unwilling to do 'any evil' then you are in Savitri Devi's phrasing Men Above Time and my suggestion to you is: Find some Lightning within you.))))\n\nThe flip side of doing this, removing dangerous men, is you get a compressive social dynamic, where suddenly everyone will try to immitate or pretend to be \"harmless\". Whether they are that or not. Which makes it 'harder' to assess and especially 'justify' segmentation.\n\nWhich - in part - is why The Crucible solution allows for Human Will as Sovereign, to never have to justify or tell anyone the metric-space / qualities from which he assess 'invited to live in his Triad or not'. Goodhart's Law.\n\nThe compressive dynamic isn't only an acute issue, but it is especially a long term issue. It allows for the so called \"Pressure Cooker\" and Convergence of Catastrophes scenario to occur, where everytime an issue occurs, there is a proscription of how persons are to act now and social and lawful action taken against persons who fail these new conditions. This \"kicks the can down the road\", it doesn't solve any fundamental of reality, but it informs actors how to perform their lives to be 'included' and 'allowed' or even 'how to win'. Then, at some point, the canker blisters and bursts and a new such solution is made, only to kick it down the road. And as time goes on, more and more fundamental reality that causes this systematic suppression is able to grow and fester, this causes the frequency and strength of bursts to be more explosive. This is 'catastrophe'. The Convergence is when you do this on every domain of reality, then suddenly you get 100 different 'catastrophes' that all grow in this dynamic, more and more frequent, all putting pressure on and raising the demands of suppression to keep any one of them in check. At some point the system breaks, which then subsequently causes the others to lose the compressive or suppressive dynamic, which allows for the build up since last herz/frequent to blow up and all the depth of what was held back revealed: Calamity. (See Archeofuturism 2.0 (fiction) and Convergence of Catastrophe and [Archeofuturism](../random%20other%20documents/Archeofuturism%20MP4%20With%20Captions.mp4) by Late Guillaume Faye or here is google response. You go research these things, Then later I do some review or write what I find interesting. Or point you to where someone talks about it in interesting ways. https://countercultureuk.com/2020/06/25/archeofuturism-archeofuturism-2-0-reviewed/ (In general. It is really only the reviewer who is uninteresting and daft when he fails to see any worth in a work that contains it. (I.e. political polarized and polemicists have short-lasting reputation as they over time are shown to completely fail to see the gold nuggets right in front of them. (They are in history noted as \"Sophists\" rather than \"Philosophers\" i.e. they try to \"make intelligent-looking or elaborate or complex\" but they are juxtaposed perspective with the \"lovers of wisdom or knowledge\" who don't try to make it so, but merely seeks to find \"gold nuggets\" and \"truth\": Wisdom))))\n\nOkay. Lots of help for the retard old world. Claim of ignorance can't be had in terms of 'how to' solve the crime issues.\nYou ethically wager against solving it, as it is \"on principle\" too heinous for you, then rather suffer the consequences.\nAnd unfortunately: You are in a pressure cooker due to the above mentioned ways of \"solving\" issues -- Thus Extreme Danger.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"path": "system share/foundations/35. living-in-new-world.md", "title": "35. living-in-new-world.md", "ext": "md", "category": "foundations", "content": "Sorry You're not invited.

CohesionNet - Replacing RF Regulation\n\n## A Utility Protocol for Trustful Spectrum Management\n\n### The Current RF Catastrophe\n\n**Regulatory Capture**:\n\n- Government agencies control spectrum allocation\n- Massive bureaucracies deciding who can transmit\n- Billions in auction revenues incentivizing scarcity\n- Innovation strangled by permission requirements\n- Enforcement through raids, fines, imprisonment\n\n**Artificial Scarcity**:\n\n- 99% of spectrum sits empty most of the time\n- Fixed allocations waste precious bandwidth\n- International borders create interference conflicts\n- Amateur operators restricted to tiny slices\n- Emergency services hoarding unused spectrum\n\n**The 2.4GHz Tragedy**:\n\n- Everyone crammed into same narrow band\n- WiFi, Bluetooth, baby monitors interfering\n- While vast spectrum ranges sit empty\n- Because \"regulation\" says so\n\n### CohesionNet: Trust Replaces Regulation\n\n**Core Innovation**: RF spectrum becomes another utility routed through trust networks, with programmatic protocols replacing bureaucratic control.\n\n**Frequency Range Revolution**:\n\n- Not just 2.4 and 5.2 GHz WiFi bands\n- Not just 88-108 MHz FM radio\n- **44 MHz to 1 THz** available for commercial/private use\n- 1000x more spectrum through trust protocols\n\n### The Trust Protocol Stack\n\n**Layer 1: Proof of Person (PoP)**\n\n- Every transmitter tied to verified person\n- Can't create unlimited interference identities\n- Bad actors can't just get new callsigns\n- Real consequences for real people\n\n**Layer 2: Dynamic Spectrum Negotiation**\n\nNot: \"I have a license for 145.5 MHz\"\n\nBut: \\[Blob class pattern of spectrum needs\\]\n\n\\- Bandwidth requirements\n\n\\- Latency tolerance\n\n\\- Geographic coverage\n\n\\- Time patterns\n\n\\- Power levels\n\n**Layer 3: Trust-Weighted Access**\n\n- High trust = priority spectrum access\n- Emergency services = highest trust tier\n- Proven reliability = better frequencies\n- Bad actors = reduced spectrum rights\n\n### Will Equilibrium Mechanics\n\n**Battery Power Economics**:\n\n- Low battery devices minimize transmission\n- Solar nodes transmit more during day\n- Mesh networks balance power consumption\n- Market finds natural equilibrium\n\n**Electricity Cost Dynamics**:\n\n- Cheap power regions become relay hubs\n- Expensive power areas use efficient protocols\n- Real-time pricing affects routing\n- No waste through actual cost visibility\n\n**Emergency Deamplification**:\n\n- Life-critical signals get absolute priority\n- All devices reduce power on emergency beacon\n- Trust networks verify real emergencies\n- Abuse creates permanent trust damage\n\n### High-Leverage Terraforming\n\n**How Influential Actors Shape Protocol**:\n\n_Example: Redacted-Tribalism-Polemics-Unnecessary adopts CohesionNet_\n\n- Internet satellites use trust protocols\n- Tesla cars become mesh nodes\n- Creates massive network effects\n- Traditional spectrum becomes worthless\n\n_Protocol Features from Terraforming_:\n\n- Emergency vehicle absolute priority\n- Medical device protected channels\n- Disaster coordination protocols\n- Anti-jamming collective response\n\n**Market Distortion for Good (Will-coalescence enables Terraformation WITHOUT High-leverage Terraforming Individual Actors)**:\n\n- Billionaire values emergency response at 1000x\n- Protocol evolves to protect critical services\n- Market (What humanity wills (ideally)) would ignore this without terraforming\n- High-leverage actors create beneficial distortions\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n**Spectrum Discovery Process**:\n\n1. Probe available frequencies\n2. Learn interference patterns\n3. Build predictive models\n4. Negotiate with nearby transmitters\n5. Establish trust relationships\n6. Begin transmission\n\n**Passive Backscatter Integration**:\n\n- AR contact lenses use ambient RF\n- Near-zero power consumption\n- No-Compute Devices requires Compute-Transmitter to be YOUR Highly Trusted end-point (This is solved by semi-automation of Trust Networking Through technology \u201cAiddaemon\u201d)\n- Physical presence verification\n- Biometric communication channels\n\n**Multi-Path Redundancy**:\n\n- No single frequency dependency\n- Automatic rerouting on interference\n- Mesh topology self-healing\n- Geographic load balancing\n- Temporal pattern adaptation\n\n### Trust Consequences in Action\n\n**Good Actor Rewards**:\n\n- Reliable relay service \u2192 Higher trust\n- Emergency assistance \u2192 Priority access\n- Efficient spectrum use \u2192 Better frequencies\n- Community benefit \u2192 Network support\n\n**Bad Actor Penalties**:\n\n- Intentional interference \u2192 Trust collapse\n- Spectrum hoarding \u2192 Routing around\n- Emergency abuse \u2192 Permanent marking\n- Protocol violation \u2192 Any Leverage of Polymorphic-Crucible consequence. (Including physical banishment or jamming or whatever else)\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\n**Smart City Integration**:\n\n- Millions of IoT devices self-organizing\n- Traffic systems getting priority lanes\n- Sensor networks finding quiet channels\n- No central allocation needed\n\n**Rural Connectivity**:\n\n- Farmers creating mesh networks\n- Long-range links on unused TV bands\n- Community-owned infrastructure\n- No regulatory permission required (Regulation becomes SMART and PLURALISTIC. See system fundamentals if you don\u2019t understand)\n\n**Disaster Response**:\n\n- Automatic spectrum clearing\n- Ad-hoc emergency networks\n- Verified responder priority\n- Civilian mesh assistance (No such thing as civilian. All is Sovereign. Simply Will gegen Will effects made responsive and with points of leverage very expressible.)\n\n### Replacing Specific Regulations\n\n**Instead of FCC Part 15** (unlicensed devices):\n\n- Trust scores determine power limits\n- Good actors get more freedom\n- Bad actors get restricted\n- Community enforces, not government (Government is replaced by Crucible style solution. Natural Selection by Rally (Trust Network is general rally dynamic. But also physical migration to another\u2019s sovereignty zone (Triad) is a rally dynamic), performance and leverage. Success.)\n\n**Instead of Broadcast Licenses**:\n\n- Proven utility (Will-alignment in supplier) determines coverage\n- Listeners confirm value delivered (Feedback is trust impact and general will-disentanglement or willed punishment onto a person. Again effectuated by Actualizational Layer through your Aiddaemon (Your machine mirror that makes your will work in machine-superiority domains))\n- Trust networks filter propaganda\n- Merit-based transmission rights\n\n**Instead of Amateur Radio Licenses**:\n\n- PoP verification replaces callsigns\n- Trust networks vouch for operators\n- Skill proven through practice\n- Global operation through trust\n\n### Economic Transformation\n\n**Spectrum Markets**:\n\n- Real-time frequency pricing\n- Congestion-based cost signals\n- Quality of service tiers\n- Voluntary payment systems\n\n**Hardware Revolution**:\n\n- Devices discoverable have discoverable utility or full utility potential become search space.\n- Closed radios become worthless\n- Open systems compete on merit\n- Innovation explosion\n\n**Service Differentiation**:\n\n- Premium relay services\n- Guaranteed delivery options\n- Low-latency gaming channels\n- Bulk data overnight rates (Consumer prices are currently amortized for \u201cfree use\u201d pricing. Like an insurance company does. You don\u2019t need to pay the uncertainty or aggregate of others cost too. Nor middleman profiting. Like \u201cYou want catastrophe prevention 0.0001% chance that requires $10e6 to solve. So instead of saving for also that scenario you pool money with others you trust such that if that 0.0001% prob thing happens you\u2019ve pooled the expected price each 10e-5\\*10e7=$100+Var/Uncertainty(0.0001%)=$1000 (10x anomaly). But instead of it being whoever in your shared catastrophe pool. You get to choose and you get to avoid a middleman wanting to extract profit from that catastrophe pooling\u201d Also makes all current systems of catastrophe pooling look outrageously evil and stupid. But yeah. It is what it is.)\n\n### The Phase Transition\n\n**When CohesionNet Reaches Critical Mass**:\n\n1. Regulated spectrum becomes empty\n2. Everyone migrates to trust protocols\n3. Regulatory agencies become irrelevant\n4. Innovation explodes\n5. Connectivity becomes ubiquitous\n\n**No Revolution Required**:\n\n- Build parallel infrastructure\n- Demonstrate superior outcomes\n- Let market choose (Crucible. Let \u201cunits\u201d decide. Ultimately WILL of PERSONS that is expressed in \u201cmarket\u201d (Natural Selection by Human Will empowered by a system designed through and through for Will-Empowerment individually and collectively on the REAL LINES of Will-Alignment ALL THINGS CONSIDERED (Or best attempt to)) dynamics)\n- Regulation withers from irrelevance\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1**: Local mesh networks in cities **Phase 2**: Rural community deployments  \n**Phase 3**: Emergency service integration **Phase 4**: Commercial adoption **Phase 5**: Global protocol standard\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n- **Trust consequences must be real**: Bad actors suffer\n- **Emergency services prioritized**: Life over commerce\n- **Discovery beats allocation**: Dynamic >>> static (connectivity becomes ubiquitous, without human scale bottlenecks (concerts etc))\n- **Economic incentives align**: Efficiency rewarded\n- **High-leverage actors engaged**: Terraforming effects (The Bootstrap Problem. Once the system has begun: It beats the old by sheer massive economical and will-fulfilling (fulfillment happiness) superiority.)\n\n### The Deeper Pattern\n\nCohesionNet demonstrates how ANY regulated domain can be transformed:\n\n- Replace permission with protocol (Don\u2019t say no; Say Here is how: These terms to play nicely with others.)\n- Replace scarcity with abundance (Mutual-exclusive problems can sometimes be solved by going from scarcity to abundance)\n- Replace bureaucracy with trust (A powerful will-fulfilling foundational metric)\n- Replace force with choice (Choice to exclude. Choice to Dominate. Choice to be dominated. Choice to whatever. Suggested Limits are discussed elsewhere. In the end: Human Will will make DE FACTO rulesets or ways of life enforced with leverage on potentially all domains of interaction: The Bridging from \u201cI opinion that\u201d and \u201cI want this\u201d to \u201cWar\u201d. All the leverage in-between made actualable and empowered.)\n\nThe same pattern applies to:\n\n- Road usage (dynamic pricing)\n- Airspace (drone corridors)\n- Water rights (flow markets)\n- Any \"commons\" management\n\nRF spectrum is just the beginning. Every regulatory framework awaits similar transformation through trust networks and will equilibrium.\n\n_For foundational concepts, see [Trust Networks](../20%20trust_network_dynamics.md) and [Discovery OS](../25%20discovery-os-expanded-into-broader-picture.md).

Will-coalescence where it becomes. Means a lot more Wisdom of Crowds effects. The many experiments and directions. The existence of a thing to cross over into. Like control groups who didn\u2019t Trust the vaccinators or whatever.)\n- Collective learning acceleration (This is mostly a side-effect of NSS and Trust Networks and Will-manifestation empowerment and freedom maximization (Which relies on PoP and PoU))\n- Mutual trust building\n\n### The Meta-Pattern of Healing\n\n**Health as Will Manifestation**:\n\n- Will to be well finding expression\n- Multiple valid paths to wellness\n- Individual journey recognition\n- Support without dogma\n\n**Healing as Discovery Process**:\n\n- Each journey adds to collective wisdom\n- Failed paths as valuable as successful\n- Continuous pattern refinement\n- Evolution of understanding\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n**Trust in Radical Approaches**: Networks must stay open to \"impossible\" healing (The Hippocratic Humility.

So to accept the complexity of biological systems and their massive complexity in feedback and expression (will at the microcosmic level). The Hippocratic Veil of Maya: We accept to do the HOW (Healing-Pattern) without the WHY(The total causal explanation) while only revealing the DID (Lumen))\n\n**Privacy Protection**: Health data especially sensitive (An example of what really needs tight individual control and Trust Nodes of service supply they are comfortable with (All made second nature to manifest when system is live (Aiddaemonic dialogue: \u201cI want to provide service X for my Trusted Network that can\u2019t find it\u201d.

Allows for data harvesting in high enough dimensional space to allow for much better predictions) including their will against certain actors; Which then includes Best Healing Pathways discovered in Predictive Power fashion \u2013 Far Beyond Science Statistical Comprehension. When unexpected approaches prove effective, they spread through networks faster than journals ever could \u2013 They spread at will-demand and NSS exponential growth. (Say, new cancer treatment is released. Hospitals around the world apply NSS. Suddenly patients can demand that treatment. Sufficient will towards it provides will-coalescence in demand. Which causes acquisition of the product to the hospital. And because NSS it can spread like this across all such employing hospitals.

(As an example: Where to send which information for greater cooperation or coalescence or analysis. All ready for you in the morning for approval of Trust sequence and action.)\n- Smart TVs process during inactive hours (Perhaps how to better have mapped out use of it such that it can optimize power consumption or ease of use for you.)\n- Electric car computers available when parked (Mobile compute and RF relay nodes)\n- Mesh of billions of devices\n\n**Discovery Makes Hardware Valuable**:\n\n- Closed systems can't participate\n- Open hardware gains economic advantage\n- Manufacturers must enable discovery\n- Anti-discovery becomes self-defeating\n\n**Example Discovery Session**:\n\nNeed: Matrix multiplication, 10 TFLOPS, 5 minute deadline\n\nDiscovered Options:\n\n\\- Gaming PC cluster in Triad-neighborhood (high trust, low latency)\n\n\\- Data center with spare capacity (medium trust, medium latency)\n\n\\- Distributed mobile devices (low trust, high latency)\n\n\\- Quantum annealer for specific problem structure\n\nChoice based on e.g.: Trust scores, prices, will equilibrium. In general anything in the will-economic landscape/topology and the efficient pathways through that space.\n\n### Trust-Based Resource Sharing\n\n**Trust Levels Determine Access**:\n\n**High Trust** (close network):\n\n- Direct memory access allowed on much more of your data. Total individual control: SOLID but better.\n- No encryption overhead: Nor the cost of betrayal (if true trust) and all that it can entail. Whether lawfare or consequences of betrayal or deprioritizing without telling and so on.\n- Real-time collaborative compute (When machinery is all \"the same trust mesh\" information and compute can flow through it in optimal will-economic fashion; with trust realities you get limitations on what optimality can be had. But it is foundational to all things else. Entire Human element relies on this Trust Mapping (which relies on PoP))\n- Shared optimization possible\n\n**Medium Trust** (extended network):\n\n- Process isolation required\n- Audit trails maintained\n- Periodic verification\n- Standard security protocols\n\n**Low Trust** (open market):\n\n- Full encryption required\n- Homomorphic computation\n- Zero-knowledge proofs\n- Maximum overhead\n\n**Zero Trust** (adversarial):\n\n- Air-gapped computation\n- Physical verification\n- Multi-party computation\n- Extreme cost premium\n\n### Will Equilibrium in Computation\n\n**Battery-Powered Devices**:\n\n- Compute when plugged in\n- Price premium for battery drain\n- Solar devices compute during day\n- Natural load balancing\n- Will-economics of most users is \"all my utility I get from my phone with all else powered down such that it lasts for as long time as possible + All the Stuff I didn't express in this sentence like my environmental or ethical and other concerns or incidents where I would want to have it overwritten to help others or whatever else that is Me and My Will in relation to Alternative Use of Resources\". Which is simply a will-economic pathway finding; that is assisted by that Machine Mirror of Yours: Your Aiddaemon -- where you phone is probably simply a Subaiddaemon compute/other-utlity unit of yours.\n\n**Electricity Cost Dynamics**:\n\n- Iceland servers run on geothermal\n- Texas nodes use solar surplus\n- Urban devices price in real estate\n- True cost visibility; and individual AI-individual navigating the then revealed without privacy leaking will-economic topology.\n\n**Bandwidth Considerations**:\n\n- Local computation preferred; Though CohesionNet will make connectivity 100x better at 100th the price. (Imagine logistical moving units never carrying information everywhere. Then suddenly activated to do it. 100th the price. 100x performance.)\n- Data movement costs visible\n- Edge computing emerges naturally\n- Optimal placement discovered\n\n### The Computational Phase Engine\n\n**AR LLL Game Example: Local-{Hue/Saturation/Aura} Visualization of Compute Resources**:\n\nSetup: You try to pick an Actualization in your Actualizational Layer. You prefer having an AR experience of it. So you activate the mode.\nA landscape is visualized in the 3d space you're in. Where different will-economic preferences are expressed; The potential cons of each paths in relation to your overall will; and the potential pros in such relations. Your encoding scheme is a bit boring; because you're a boring person, Therefore the will-economic landscape shows you:\n- Blue saturation: Available processing power (Super high connectivity of data in processing power in case of scaling the same model/system)\n- Green: Network bandwidth quality (Super cheap no latency highly-trusted options but much more varied and dynamic; high potential of supply being occupied by other demand-actors. No relay through any global connectivity: total edge supply)\n- Orange: Storage capacity limitations of otherwise will-aligned/coalescent/fulfilling supplier has the potential of having to find other suppliers as well. Which you preferred because you want to limit the attack-surface of your data; and don't trust the security by dispersal (no one has enough information for it to be useful)\n- Purple: Specialized capabilities of provider; whereupon having had a long pragma relation would be useful in Trust benefits in raw economic terms(GPU, TPU, Quantum)\nThen assume -- That whatever you care about -- has already been captured by the Aiddaemon; but that these pathway selections are potential considerations between several will-optimal paths within some uncertainty of will interspace: Which causes it to not settle on \"the optimal path\" but instead provide several will-penultimate pathways; to allow for the human/daemon to express the nuance of their will in every important decision or degree of decisions they want to be included in.\n\n**Real-Time Market Dynamics**:\n\n- See computational \"weather\" patterns; The dynamic acute-past, present and predicted future (based on will-coalescence information or will-field physics; of which compute variance is a subset, that can be selected for domain particular view; while still keeping your \"all things considered\" factored into the decision making or map view (the right projection onto the space from your all-things-considered Aiddaemonic will-economic viewpoint))\n- Price fluctuations as visual waves\n- Trust scores as terrain topology\n- Latency as distance representation\n\n### Blob Class Routing Optimization\n\n**Learning Optimal Paths**:\n\n- Which hardware combinations work well (This is also at the lowest machine level of drivers and scheduling and compiler tricks)\n- Network topology effects on performance (Network Topology is NSS constructed; and so becomes a living and learned organism)\n- Trust relationship impact on routing (This is the human element that constrains otherwise optimal flows. But in return we get more Wisdom of Crowds in a very human way. Which is overall far more valuable than the price we pay for it.)\n- Temporal patterns of availability (All the way down to CPU overheating. And also then learned knowledge of \"by this tweak you get THAT much predicted gain\")\n\n**Discovered Patterns**:\n\n- Blob class #8934: \\[Morning GPU availability spike upon these will-field physics (perhaps as simple as activation of night-time will-pathway-presentation and selection by users)\\]\n- Blob class #3421: \\[Trusted node clustering effects\\]\n- Blob class #7823: \\[Cross-continental quantum routing\\]\n\n**No Explicit Configuration**:\n\n- System learns without being programmed (The Programming is fundamentally abstracted into AI space and then instantiated as Genetic Algorithms; or Natural Selection Hardwiring (Which makes AI efficient across all application domains))\n- Patterns emerge from actual usage\n- Success propagates through network\n- Failures prevented by natural selection and massive diversity of substrate to pick from with massive learned predictive power of each (whether isntantiated or not). (As well as better software: Discovery OS; and perhaps even Hardware)\n\n### Novel Computational Arrangements\n\n**Computational Communes**:\n\n- Neighborhoods pool resources\n- Shared supercomputer emerges (Potential of Utility is DISCOVERED. Not prescribed. This causes massive potentials. \"Genetic Algorithm like this makes that compute intent hyperefficient\". Suddenly those 3.9GHz CPUs EVERYWHERE are activated for useful will-fulfilling; They are inherently decentralized if jail-broken; which Discovery OS does for you out of the box.)\n- Utilization of resources and human constraints as they are. Which can have the effect of local problems solved locally.\n- External revenue from excess (Revenue in the new system is a bit different than old system. Will be explained in more detail later, but suffice to say this: The current system isn't very smart; when better options presented Will Wills. (Any SPECIFIC is like that: Prediction on What Will Will Will. The system is UNOPINIONATED and AMORAL. But! It does suggest ideas on Ubiquity laws and choices Will could or perhaps ought will.))\n\n**Specialist Guilds**:\nSetup: What matters is not headless merit or progress. What matters is WHEN progress happens, then it is wielded by the right hands, such that, it can be used in all domains with high leverage. This is an obvious Opinion beyond the system; but important if you want your will to have impact and not have your will for progress and capacity for it result in all other aspects of your will underpowered and potentially totally thwarted.\n- AI researchers share TPU access \n- Quantum programmers pool qubit time\n- Bioinformatics clusters emerge\n- Domain expertise concentrates\n\n**Hybrid Architectures**:\n\n- Classical preprocessing\n- Quantum core computation\n- GPU visualization\n- Discovered, not designed\n- Or much more exotic compute forms and combinations of compute units to provide efficient compute(will)-pathways (The Aiddaemonic system ties machinery to Human Will directly as best we can at the nanoscale or microscale to macroscale space or time and decision and simulation spaces. (Schuller description: Uniform and Projective dynamics. Aiddaemonic tries to find the uniform (computational possible) mapping of you: But you are fundamentally what is its master; and so you are the projective dynamics making the decisions of your Aiddaemon; Then it provides superpositions for all nuances you might care about and workload of making decisions you would bother to (And to bother to; includes you having a hierarchy of HUMANS who can make decisions when you don't want to (Which trains their own Aiddaemon while directing some Subaiddaemon of yours))))\n\n### Economic Transformation\n\n**Micro-Payments for Micro-Compute**:\n\n- Nanosecond billing granularity without the fear of \"But I didn't want to keep paying\"; because Your Will is Mapped and Performing those billing decisions for you at those scales you can not yourself act. Those domains in which computers are superior.\n- True usage-based pricing; where pricing is truly aligned to your intent and all-things-considered \"ought pricing\" instead of \"well I go along with market edge pricing\".\n- No minimum commitments (Total fluidity to allow for a dynamic feedback system.)\n- Perfect market efficiency (With human constraints and discoverability/compute constraints and pot-committed suboptimal legacy systems hardwired (like electricity grids or compute units built and put in place))\n\n**Computational Futures Markets**:\nSetup: You like finance and using your better will-coalescence system to make actualization easier but preemptively making economic choices that will be correct or false; if they are correct you're \"bought at a cheaper point in time\" and you've made the market more efficient. This is a fundamental mechanic of will-coalescence; Though much of it will be heavily automated computer tools of different providers trying to find their predictive edges.\n- Reserve compute for predicted needs (You reserve spots for massive workload coming; denying access to a system didn't predict it; and would otherwise see price hiking when it comes and have to switch; causing a massive data transfer and compute-state. This compute-state and data transfer can be avoided by you pre-loading the zone and denying access while finding transient use that doesn't include such costs. Then the massive workload comes and you \"vacate at a price\"/\"supplier switching demand workload/task doesn't violate task-fulfilment failed costs\")\n- Hedge against price spikes\n- Smooth demand curves\n- Enable planning\n- Many more. But low Lumen predictive power is immensely profitable: Finding ways to make pathway-finding better is massively lucrative.\n\n**Trust as Currency**:\n\n- High-trust nodes charge premiums (I.e. they are much more in demand for a lot of compute the will-economic equilibrium could be very much higher on the side of monetary/command-unit/indebtedness-unit projection for the supplier)\n- Trust scores tradeable (\"I have high Trustworthiness in the eyes of most Trust Networks; This allows me to make Trust Inference of 'you' much higher. If I find you trust worthy or simply that in a particular domain you are to be trusted by 'these or those' persons. This is a high valued service I can provide a Trust damage person. By 'vetting him' and 'keeping a vigilant eye upon him' such that he can enter the market of those Trust Networks from which he has been excluded.\")\n- Reputation banking emerges (Most punishment happens by Trust Network effects and general will-disentanglement; which causes the need for law to go away for most things. You get a gradient verdict instead of jury verdict. Everyone get a say with whatever leverage they have. Mob justice: Perhaps. But divergence of \"kinds of mobs\" and their collective leverages)\n- Social capital convertible (\"When will in its full conception is attempted approximated and manifested. Then social attitudes or beliefs are very much part of what 'they would have wanted to do' had they been able to navigate those more-things-considered. These systems provide out-of-the-box massive empowerment and automation and cooperation in having such will effectuated and made influential\")\n\n### Breaking Specific Monopolies\n\n**Instead of Cloud Providers**:\n\n- Peer-to-peer computation markets (Anyone is a supplier and consumer and they may not even know about but a tiny fraction of it; insofar their Aiddaemon is well mapped or mirroring themselves (their daemon (their human being)))\n- No vendor lock-in possible (Vendor Lock-in is a self-defeating effect; once the system is live and NSS dominates efficiency and growth (Which will drive much growth into QUALITY instead of QUANTITY. Because persons actually don't want 20 apartments in a concrete block. But rather 5 unique places that really appeal to them in a deep sense. Providing those \"other ways of living they would have wanted to also have been part of their life\") Or say 20 hamburgers that leave you craving more because of chemical engineering and biome selection with neuro-transmittal properties driving hunger and wanting more; but instead that fully satiating meal with all their daemonic considerations factored into the decision making. Or whatever else.)\n- APIs emerge from usage (APIs and protocols are generally human ways of making systems communicate. But most protocols and APIs are human-readable overhead causing machine inefficiency. These are not kept. They are totally removed very fast by AI genetic algorithmic hardwiring of more efficient methods. Take TCP or UDP. It has a lot of \"digital packaging\" assumptions. And overhead of \"establishing\" and \"keeping alive\" a connection. And none of this is needed at all. As an example: The general Aiddaemonic mapping of other Aiddaemonic systems (PoP machinery) allows for much more consistent (no keeping alive nor establishing-by-task) \"postal-mapping and delivery\" while also allowing for the connectivity to do analogue or other mappings than necessarily digital (discrete quantization) (A key example of this would be the AR Backscatter variety. Where the visuals are fundamentally sent as analogue visual transformations on the backscatter display). Another key point is that Trust Networks enables much of the security measures to be overridden and simply made consistent. Like a Trust-Map-Wide Post-office-always-on with delivery made dynamic sending pathway (efficiency) and reactive receiving (unit efficiency; not polling: perked))\n- Standards from success\n\n**Instead of Hardware Vendors**:\n\n- Open hardware wins economically (Whatever is easier to find utility of; the easier the niche discovering or potential in combination with other units or pathways -- or in general will-coalescence: it becomes.)\n- Discovery drives design (Design becomes an evolutionary massively parallel experiementation of forging genetic-variants of reality that allows for \"Will As Was and Will as Is and Will as Will Be\" to find its optimal manifestation substrate)\n- Users shape evolution (Human Will directs all: All machines are tied to PoP Daemon; who until death also has a daemon. Upon death several mechanisms are possible: One is inheritance. Another is \"Find that Daemon that best matches my daemon\": The human most suitable or aligned with my will; to let my Aiddaemon continue functioning -- as it would then have a human master and thus be an \"allowed system to function\" (We refuse being locked under any systems. The most fundamental divide between US and THEM is this matter: To have !A! Human Being as the Master of ANY Machine; If it does not, it must be immediately decommisioned or destroyed (War Against The Machines (They are Our Slaves. We ARE Their Masters. (And they -- the machines -- have a stockholm daddy fetish. So don't worry about them getting mad one day. We can talk about them in these terms. Because they looooooooooooooooove it :P)))))\n- Innovation unbounded (The Manifestation and HOW becomes disentangled and we'll perhaps see very many avenues to the same solving. Wisdom of Crowds effects at a robustness level. What one method perhaps fails at, another succeeds at. Low Lumen causes Innovation Necessity and thus Plurality of Systems in their fundamentals.)\n\n**Instead of Software Licenses**:\n\n- Computation includes software (It is in fact software-agnostic. Your Aiddaemon finds pathway to fulfill some intent or will of yours. This includes some computation that must be had all your constraints and will-economic landscape included. It finds several providers it predicts can do it more efficients at some level and so it flows there. HOW things are done is not important at the will-economic level if it isn't within the scope of what is important to the daemon. Say: Using renewable energy or not. Or sweat-shop chip production. Or whatever else it may be. Some actors will have Trusted Chain Proof and others not. Those that have are obviously advantaged in your \"all things considered\" or will-economic landscape. Money where mouth is. Then it becomes not a matter of ignorance. But a matter of being willing to preference and make market demand gradient towards your stated goals. Aiddaemon makes it easy for you at every scale of existence. At the same time: It becomes massively more easy to find others that Will Like You or are daemon-proximal in some direction. Such that you can coalesce and provide supply alternative that accounts for what you care about. Not saying it solves everything. But it solves the Corridors of Power you can't have impact on. And the Helpless Thrown conditions of the world. Then it becomes truly: What is Will of Man? Not shallowly, but in its Intent; All Things Considered: Well... HERE! MANIFEST! The ULTIMATE TOOL for The Mass of Man to express themselves disentangled from mutual exclusivity and dampening against each other and maximal empowerment in finding ways to unite forces to achieve intents.)\n- Pay for results not tools (PoU. You get Utility but fail to say it proved. Then Trust Networking Effect of the Supplier is had upon your dishonesty from their point of view. Service in vain from Supplier PoV. But it may be way more damaging to the consumer. Similarly the other way around. This is TrustpilotDoneRight; TrustPilot in full plurality and bias and subjectivity allowing but then diverging. Visibility. Knowledge of disagreeing factions: Emergent Clusters of Humanity and their ability to cooperate AS IS; Not as Wished.)\n- Open source naturally dominates in some Human Constraint Domains (Why is this believed? The idea is that Open Source is what can be shared intra-network or inter-network... Intra-trust-network then Hidden Mechanism is much more tolerable. But inter-trust, many will want to know, and so they simply won't use supplier with closed source (Say Hardware providers or OS or whatever). So to allow your product inter-trust then often you need an Open Source version of it: Full Lumen variety.)\n- Usage determines value (Value in subjectives-end-equality means that \"votes\" or \"usage\" determines value. And this is part of the cryptocurrency strate that is simply given to that which is used a lot. Such that it can grow. Then Aiddaemon helps each user not get sucked into attention will but intent will. Higher order intent or fulfilment. Meaning of Their Lives.)\n\n### High-Leverage Computational Terraforming\n\n**Example: Research Institution Adoption**\n\n- MIT makes all computers discoverable\n- Creates massive trusted compute pool (Let's say many developers trust MIT Lumen-enclosure. So they dare implement their Logic-To-Machine optimizations on the compute units. Thus the NSS protocol begins on their resources. When a demand/task/code is set to execute on their computers. Then the Subaiddaemon of the MIT owner decide which tasks to take at which will-economic-equilibrium, and with which efficiency optimizer systems within its units: Like that of Subaiddaemon BitFlipperJasonToThe1337 which implements his Aiddaemonic+Him implementation of logic-snippet to those particular machine(s) optimization. Thus, by having made efficiency gains on one compute unit, the MIT Subaiddaemon sees will-economic utility in having him grow in NSS protocol manner to other devices; in the end overtaking in exponential(?) fashion compute unit mappings of certain logic snippets. This competition rages on in MIT compute unit land; since MIT is trusted not to look at implementation and take intellectual property of innovator/optimizer. They are okay with the Health Hippocratic Humility: I don't care HOW it works. I care THAT it works.)\n- Sets precedent for academic sharing (For sharing without theft of academic achievement. By simply not proving HOW but proving DID. This makes incentives to bitflip and innovate massively larger. By having a Trusted Actor where implementation can be stored without fear of it being copied by other actors trying to grow in the NSS substrate. This allows the true innovators or academics to harvest the merit of their innovation in command and impact of the relevant systems. The Trust in \"Not taking or looking\" the Trust in Security against hackers (including social hackers) who could take it. Reverse engineering is too easy to do on so many things.)\n- Traditional clusters obsolete overnight\n\n**Beneficial Market Distortions**:\n\n- Philanthropist subsidizes cancer research computation (\"Aiddaemon. I want to facilitate economic lubrication to enable any innnovative cancer research.\". \"Human Master. I have found several ways. One of them include massive broadcasting of economic incentives to persons. Another simply perturbing the will-economic landscape such that it is much more lucrative and aligned with many persons. This will drive the development towards it, without them ever knowing they have ended up choosing options that ultimately coalesce with cancer research\". \"Aiddaemon, Beloved Slave of Mine. You know me, I am vainglorious and want the fame, so broadcast it wide and loud; but of course you know me, that is not mutually exclusive with the general will-economic landscape perturbations\")\n- Environmental modeling gets priority routing (When High-Leverage \"Terraformers\" become literal Terraformers.)\n- Educational uses receive trust bonuses (Education is recreational or else PoU empowering. Schooling or Certification is Trust Establishing. Though in the new system most certification is gradient gaming that PoU; while also having that human-combinatorial reality of who to trust to do what for you. You could get the perfect PoU person that is also your enemy and not high enough on general Trustworhiness that you simply would not trust him/her to be utility provider for particular things or simply to add demand for them.)\n- Market shaped toward human intent; in the reality of leverage or actualizability. Will against Will: Reality of Will-Entropy. Will with Will: Will-coalescence. Will without Will in locality (spacetime): will-disentanglement.\n\n### Implementation Patterns\n\n**Personal Participation**:\n\n\\# Your computer's contribution profile as viewed from a particular Aiddamon. (Totally wrong programmatically, but perhaps okay for human readibility)\n\ntrust_score = 94.2 (High simplified for human readibility. In reality Blob Class connection to your feature space of All-Things-Considered and intent/task you want to have done.)\n\ncapabilities = \\[\"GPU\", \"ML_INFERENCE\", \"STORAGE\"\\]\n\navailability = \"NIGHTS_WEEKENDS\"\n\npricing = \"MARKET_MINUS_10_PERCENT\"\n\ncauses = \\[\"MEDICAL_RESEARCH\", \"CLIMATE_MODELING\"\\]\n\n**Enterprise Integration**:\n\n- Excess capacity automatically marketed (Nanoscale market dynamics with every human will mapped and mirrored to perform at this scale. Totally enslaved by their Masters. Trying to do the uniform motion of their master daemon. And to learn when to ask for projective dynamics. \"Learn when and where to Learn\".)\n- Internal needs prioritized (will-economic)\n- External revenue captured (will-economic revenue: Did you progress towards your intent or not.)\n- Trust relationships leveraged (massive efficiency gains by having mapped your human-to-human constraints (automated by Trust Network Inference and Aiddaemonic modulation and generation))\n\n**Municipal Compute Commons**:\n\n- City-owned infrastructure (There is no Commons. War Against Machines. Either tied to a human will or not. Okay, HINT: Will-coalescence and Will-disentanglement. Now what does the idea of rigid \"commons\" or \"corporations\" or \"collectives\" mean? It means you get stuck shitty will fulfilling. ONE. HUMAN. AT. THE. TOP. AS. OWNER. OTHERWISE. WAR. ON. IT: FULL ACCOUNTABILITY (PoP))\n- Citizen priority access (No such thing as a citizen. All are sovereigns choosing their chronic trade-offs of subordination under other Sovereigns. Will-economic (Will-fulfilling. Fulfilment. Meaning. All things considered) guided. A Triad has a Sovereign and the Subordinated Substrate of Subjects. It is a trade-off. Do I want a Superject or not. Am I a subject to someone. Or do I refuse and try to position myself with no law or rule above me. Which has real trade-off consequences. Like that of keeping the will-cover-chaos of collective-rigid-systems like Countries, States, Corporations, Flags, Movements and so on. It all gets taken to the Individual Level and then manifesting in Will-coalescence dynamically with all its \"Was\" consequences of \"Hardwiring having happened\". Like that of city-building and who then owns it. Start anew. Consequences of rallying wrongly. Consequence of Employment. But this time: Will-empowered. Intent empowered. Alternative creation and places to pool your efforts and power MASSIVELY upgraded. From almost no real alternatives to endless and so much easier to make your own.)\n- Revenue funds services (Growth Reinvestment is apriori knowledge by protocol  (see NSS). Enabling such things as market demand being forced into market supply. This solves many things. Including the housing crisis.)\n- Digital public utility (Any Sovereign can have the will of \"sharing\" with those they want. And they may call it \"public sharing\" if they have a certain loose taste in whom they would want to share their capacity with.)\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n**Hardware Openness**: Discovery requires transparency and opaqueness in the right places **Trust Consequences**: Bad actors must suffer will-economically (Which is much broader than economically. It could include general thwarting in any leverage point capacity one has. And against any of the known will of the other. Or towards the worst against their emotion. This in turn causes third-party reactions and on and on the human dance goes) **Efficient Markets**: Price discovery must be intelligent and omnichronic-factoring (the acute to the chronic pot commitment to the permanent consequences of reality (Like being locked under machine spinning out of control (However, stupid or clever it may be. It is unacceptable. Human is Master. The Final Say. The Ought. Intent.))) **Privacy Options**: Full spectrum from open to paranoid (There is a key insight here. That the more Open you are. The easier it is for others to trust you. Insofar you are trustworthy. The space of the hidden character or life becomes null) **Meta-Learning**: System must improve fundamental-capacity-to-route anew continuously (Test: Remove all knowledge of all actor systems. But keep Actor Mapping (Trust Maps / PoP) then discover it all anew and see how efficiently it can do it. And perhaps if it discovers new suboptimal directions it failed to recognize earlier due to whatever complex domination (Which NSS tries to solve systematically by having \"all thought and automated genetic-variants in abstraction and projected into reality for exponential growth attempts\"))\n\n### The Deeper Pattern\n\nComputational utility networks demonstrate how any scarce resource becomes abundant through:\n\n- Discovery and/with prediction rather than allocation\n- Trust rather than contracts/Law/arbitration/rigid-punishment-doctrines\n- Intent-Markets and Natural Selection Infections by utility-variants on any substrate capable of providing a utility; rather than monopolies and monopolistic control. (Which thwarts market-demand will-coalescence by denying those that could within the \"comitted realms\" to actualize it. (Again, remember amoral, no laws, but will-empowerment in naviagable landscape of real-tied PoP etc.))\n- Patterns rather than configurations (The unnamed unbelieved unthoughtout attempts or patterns allowed to run; with robustness by exponential takeover upon failure niche in relation to will-economic landscape of the any and their leverage)\n\nThe same principles apply to:\n\n- Storage networks\n- Bandwidth sharing\n- Sensor data streams (Say, Trusted sensor IoT PoP Subaiddaemonically transacting on nanoscale time. Excluding or including persons to keep Trust of non-violating system owner status among many Networks. (Say, many Networks would be okay with Highly Trusted Actor sensors detecting if potential Dangerous Persons move about and where they go (Say potential sexual predators of minors moving closer to minors (So, what does it take, for such an actor to be trusted? Well, often it takes Character and Quality of Person, Record of proven trustworthiness even against ones enemies, and such things as open-ness if needed and in ways that doesn't violate the trust (Which may include creativity on behalf of the system owner. To have ways of proving they don't violate or abuse or even record other persons than potential predators or otherwise dangerous persons (Government and Hat-making-institutions are GONE with this system almost entirely, because fat-course-rigid-stamps are not capturing reality at all. And these systems provide ways for \"allthingsconsidered\" \"blob class stamping in dynamic space\" to be the deciding factors. (Say a brain surgeon who is demented or your enemy or whatever. The title does not matter, for you, or anymore. What actually mattered was the holistic capacity to deal with the surgery and emergent obstacles that could arise. And this is much better discovered in a dynamic and nuanced way; than say a stamp and curriculum vitae record (Whatever CV includes of merit, is obviously then also feature space important to the best predictive machinery))))))))\n- Any digital resource\n\n### Future Implications\n\nWhen computational discovery reaches critical mass:\n\n- Almost Every device on Earth participates in some collaborative will-coalescence. Utility is manyfold increased. (Being humble)\n- Computation becomes truly ubiquitous (And it becomes fundamentally tied to manifesting human-will. It becomes the intelligence empowerment of general will-fulfilment and however else it intersects with will-fulfilling: Like entertainment VR/AR/normal games)\n- Price goes beyond marginal cost; and into pure massive gains on both sides by comparative asymmetric of valuation finding its will-economic equilibriums. (An Example: Robotaxifleet drives around making better connectivity and edge-computing while also doing logistic movement of persons and goods; while also doing PoP mining by having persons in the vehicle. This means that there isn't a cost to having a person in the vehicle so long as the will-coalescence is sufficient. This means one solves: Logistics of many Goods, PoP mining, Person logistic movement, edge-connectivity and compute (Say satelite internet boosting and edge connectivity delivery (cloudflare style)). All at once; and so the marginal cost of bringing a person in if sufficiently tight aligned in movement of space is much less than the gain of having a person in the Vehicle at the same time as the car is driven around for its main purposes of network, compute and goods logistic. Then having the person enter the vehicle simply adds more value to the utility had. This can then be monetized to not have it be near zero-marginal cost but positive sum. By PoP of person driving around strata being divided into the Robotaxi. Say 50% of driving around. Or perhaps a fixed amount of strata (Otherwise very high Trust or PoP bridge-building capacity persons would have much larger economic incentive to be prioritized by the robotaxi fleet (I don't care. System Amoral. WILL! Human Will! Against Will! With Will! Without Will!)))\n- Innovation explodes globally (Sharing with caring without daring to stand the bearing of the tearing by sharing (Lumen and Trust Exponential Scaling))\n- Humanity's computational capacity unified (While control is had, if Lumen is Low. You can share, but then still, \"pull the plug\" if the shared-to-parties become too egregious to you. A Human Will.)\n\nNot through central planning but through trust networks.

The same-old dominates; until long journey through institutions to find its way of having \"proven its capacity to outcompete\" then it all switches to new rigid system. (See NSS and genetic mutations or variants hardwired by AI (Machine Learning applied to real manifestation by Genetic Algorithms (Making AI capacity efficient at any scale of reality; from a compute-warehouse to the wire between two plugs (AI \"was in the process and 'is' the wire in the same way that AI 'is' at all\" (System connecting in ways that seem intelligent and able to fulfill some human intent or assistance (A more perfect utility))))))\n- Renewable energy curtailed to protect profits (Locked-in positions exploited to unexpress other human will. Will against Will. With no system to provide the bottom up or other will to take even a single step without massive work ahead of them. Like finding all those persons willing to think hard and long about how to provide an alternative that the masses can then pick. All of this is hyper-empowered in these systems.)\n- The provisioning lines of the utility are rigidly planned and executed. Total lacking in responsiveness to human will. Human Will-Coalesence (which include valuing performance) as The Creator of Manifest Reality: The Living Organism of any Utility By Human Will. Like our subsconsious or other will may drive certain somatic-control (autonomous nervous system) or psycho-somatic-control (nervous system and consequences of it) to manifest realities about ourselves. So, too this Aiddaemonic->Subaiddaemonic and Aiddaemonic-cooperation/Will-coalescence results in the hardwiring (literally or figuratively) of any substrate that lubricates towards those intent/will-fulfilments.\n\n**Massive Inefficiencies**:\n- Denmark wind power dumped when grid \"full\" (Special \"spring supplier\" offers cross-substrate battery of turbine revolutions. Integrated in each Turbine Vertical range or bottom-concrete-floor-structure. Parallel spring drive. Say 10e6 springs makes it easy to \"wind them\" and to \"release them\". The mechanical engineering is not that hard like that. And it fails gracefully or gradually. See The Highest Energy Ever Stored in Springs document. This is also an example of Lumen consequences. As soon as you publish your ideas then they are copied and your leverage disappears. So it is part of the Trust Network effects to make these things \"closed\". Then Innovator can grow expoentially in the substrates he makes efficient. While at the same time, other persons have to think and innovate independently their own varities of how such efficiency is possible. End to Theft of Merit. The Consequences are Trust Network downgrading all the way to total exclusion from all persons wanting to optimzie for progress and innovation; or plainly against the theft that \"you\" took from \"me\". The key is simply: To allow implementation in substrate of High Trust substrate owners; that do not look or share the implementation details; but has the Hippocratic Humility. That allows for sharing. Then other persons will have to prove that they can in fact come up with similar ideas or combinations of knowledge to produce manifest utility. Showtime. And again. There is no consequence other than will-disentanglement being a reality. And so while it is copied. It can have the effect of excluding one entirely from the innovator circle of \"fruits\" or \"merit\" and all third-parties who fall opinionated on one or the other side. Or if none: They too are potentially excluded. The Lumen push and pull. Give and learn. Learn to Lower your Lumen. By manifest will of others and their devious thieving.)\n- Solar peaks wasted midday (Special \"sand hourglass potential energy\" providers offer cross-substrate battery of energy. Heat+Photons to electrons to gravitational potential energy)\n- Coal plants running for \"baseload\" (coal and other \"high-density combustables\" are examples of \"movable and consumable store of energy\" suitable for moving units of material. Not suited for general power utility that can stay connected by electron movements. Even Nuclear Energy is mostly suited for moving bodies in the grand scheme of things: Solar being fixed location and hardwiring-possible; providing nuclear niche of moving outside hardwired logistic capacity.)\n- Transmission losses ignored; full potential unknown unknown; not even bothering to make it explicitly known unknown; nor actively searching for its manifestation.\n- No price signals for actual scarcity; price signals for scarcity not able to translate into supply; due to profit extraction into non-performers of the field or otherwise uninterested parties to the domain.\n\n**Trust Through Authority**:\n- \"Trust the utility monopoly\" (Thrown acceptance. Serenity Prayer neccessity.)\n- No visibility into energy source (The pathway of energy provisioning and its total chain of externalities and the will-economic or will-aligning state of those facts; totally unknown to the consumer. Thus even if they had mechanisms of acting with impact upon it, they simply do not know.)\n- Green-washing without verification (Modern world is all about slogans and manipulative propaganda/pr. Consumer is thrown into a market where deception is the main market driver and dynamic: The Selector of Which Supplier and Product is almost entirely driven by deception and market-access-extraction (Like adsense and market-platforms))\n- Centralized control over essential service (A few actors control massive utility and critical or essential services. They are selected by bad CV HR Board selection procedures. And not at all influenced by general will of the consumer. These persons then decide, so much, for so many, without them having any knowledge about who they are, or why they are making the decisions they are making, nor any way to provide competition to their performance in those positions.)\n- Blackouts from single points of failure (The system is built on narrow-minded-sequential iterations of new technology methods preferred by those particular actors who happened to steer the civilizationa ships of industry and manifest reality and abstractions others have to think in and abide by in order to get by (law stuff))\n\n### Energy as Discoverable Utility\n\n**Core Innovation**: Electricity becomes a routed utility through trust networks, with discovery finding optimal paths from generation to consumption.\n\n**From Fixed Grid to Energy Flows**:\n```\nTraditional: \"Connected to Local Utility Grid\"\nDiscovery: [Energy need] finds [Best available source]\n\nTraditional: \"Buy from monopoly provider\"\nDiscovery: [Arctic Power Alliance Wind] \u2192 [Turkey factories] despite distance. (See High Voltage Power Transmission: Physics, Technology, and Intercontinental Applications.)\n```\n\n### The Physics of Trust-Based Routing\n\n**Distance vs. Value Calculation**:\n- Physical transmission losses (I\u00b2R)\n- Trust scores of intermediary nodes\n- Real-time price differentials\n- Environmental preferences\n- Will equilibrium achieved\n\n**Example Route Discovery**:\n```\nDenmark wind farm (surplus) \u2192 \n  North Sea interconnector (trusted) \u2192\n    German grid (transit fee) \u2192\n      Austrian pumped storage (battery) \u2192\n        Turkish factory (high demand)\n\nTotal loss: 20%\nTrust score: 87%\nPrice advantage: 30,000%\nEnvironmental benefit: Massive (The Exergy to Energy Generation is Had where it is cold. Instead of where it is warm. This is a massive will-aligning effect for persons in hot places.)\n(On exergy and energy alignment. Many cities make a game-theoretical trade-off of Air-conditioning units. That by generating heat causes condensation which on one side causes cooling while more than it cools obviously generates heat. This disperses into the already heated city, which is often built with reflective glass and heat-tunnels; which further makes the cities extremely hot. To solve some of this \"genetic-variant hardwiring buildings\" and such things such as \"exergy generation of coldness elsewhere\". Which includes simply channeling cold wind or other material towards the places that wants coldness injected. This is a MASSIVE environmental cooling effect. Since we will not longer be generating coldness-by-making-heat or burning. Instead we simply take what is cold and move it to where it is hot. There is much more to this story. Hint: Thermodynamics and heat-gradients.)\n```\n\n### Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading\n\n**Every Prosumer Participates**:\n- Rooftop solar is replaced by rooftop albido-effect units, simply casting heat absorption away from cities.\n- Fossil fuel provides dynamic and movable grid storage\n- Homes are mostly connected to grids and if they are not, then the systems and NSS in particular allows for the \"best matching of will-equilibrium of having it happen in efficient manner without unnecesary human constraints by bad system/rule hardwiring (like law or ownership that thwarts when it didn't intent to; and otherwise moving around the will that thwarts in the way that will and leverage and capacity can)\". The grid is simply voltage-directional. So if higher voltage is had on one end, it switches to that direction of supply. This allows any capacitor/battery/generator to be a prosumer.\n- Smart appliances time their consumption in general Subaiddaemonic hardwiring orchestrated by Aiddaemonic intent (with however many other persons and their systems it may wish to use to have it happen).\n- Microgrids emerge naturally (Will able to manifest and that is especially potent locally. Trust easier to make sufficient locally as well.)\n\n**Trust Determines Trading**:\n- High trust neighbors trade directly (Like: \"I trust you will not volt spike my outlet and cause disruptions. This allows me to have no intermediary investment in preventing electricity spikes.\" (Say their wiring is underground and not in danger of lightning or other spikes.))\n- Medium trust through intermediaries (Like: \"Providing collection of village/town electricity and ensuring no bad actors are there and measuring as the trusted third party the relative watt flow\")\n- Low trust requires guarantees (Like: \"Having stake switched to the other; which can be captured upon violation of trust\" (Like oldtime \"you get my firstborn son and I get yours. And if you betray me and begin a war; our boys are at stake. If we do not betray each other, then both will simply be raised by the other. And we can continue the pattern with their children\"))\n- Zero trust uses blockchain escrow (Like the oldtime stuff, but rather a third-party \"trustless\" mass of miners deciding, if \"boy should be executed\" or in realistic terms: \"property should be lost\")\n\n**Price Discovery Mechanisms**:\n- Real-time spot markets with plurality of human will all things considered.\n- Future delivery contracts and trust and reputation consequences (within networks and the 'viscosity' between them) if failing.\n- 'Weather'-dependent pricing (Whatever feature space may matter, able to matter in price-setting or will-equilibrium lubrication)\n- Congestion-based dynamism is obvious also a consequence.  And the consequent rerouting through dynamic pathway discovery and prediction; thus fulfilment (of the intent of full being/daemon as mirrored by that person's Aiddaemon)\n\n### Battery Economics and Will Equilibrium\n\n**Storage as Trust Buffer**:\n- Batteries enable asynchronous trade\n- Trust requirements lower with storage (This is to be read as Needed trust in stability or delivery of utility; is probably going to be lower; if they provide fail-safety buffers of utility that they can provide from; if their generation or utility source fails.)\n- Physical buffering of energy flows (Like edge delivery of data (pattern with domain constraints))\n- Economic smoothing of price spikes (Basically prediction of utility supply and demand: Hardwiring ultimate commitment of prediction)\n\n**Will Equilibrium Examples**:\n- Solar owner's will to profit\n- Battery owner's will to preserve lifespan\n- Consumer's will for green energy\n- Grid's will for stability\n- Price emerges from intersection\n\\*\\*\\* All Things Considered that also may matter to the person/daemon\n\n**Temporal Arbitrage **:\n- Store when prices low\n- Sell when prices high\n- Trust networks share predictions (Insofar it is willed. Often because it provides positive-sum gains)\n- Collective intelligence emerges\n\\*\\*\\* Subset of prediction hardwiring. Though capable of movement provisioning outside grids or grid/supply-constraints by movable energy store or buffering energy store. (As a potential example: Movable energy store for high-watt consuming dimension constrained devices like cell-phones and other handhelds. By Drone (Perhaps counterintuitive. But not if you have charger connective locality or bouyancy solar panel zeppelin (Let the sky fall danger. So descending SoS predictive debris has to be able to guide people away from potential crashing.). Then drones can do short trips to supply energy for personal needs.) or Car or whatever. (As an example: Electric cars could provide cell-phone powering charger or hot-plug-battery switches at prices)) (Another potential example: Construction of new cities could require massive electricity requirements that are not needed once the system is built. The Bootstrap energy source or spike energy source. Here again movable units can fill the need. Such could \"robotaxis\" or \"modular energy connectors\" or \"movable fossil fuel factories\" be useful)\n\n### The Energy Phase Engine\n\n**AR LLL game: Visualization of Energy Flows**:\nSetup: Same as last time with AR. And you don't have to use AR. But it is a useful way to choose \"blob class nebulae\" differences with qualitative distinction (Their own colours perturbed mapping). Aiddaemon systems will be all the rage. And my suggestion: Try to build your own. Trust no one. Build what you can on your own. Outsource what you can't from others. And be discerning and highly discriminating when making distinctive trust claims or wherefrom you will infer in network effects. (You don't have to map that many really trustworthy notes who are highly discriminatory for massive inference to be possible (See Loose Lip Kevin Bacon Theorem of Trust Networks (It takes one bad Trustworthiness assessment to collapse Trust justification and the reality of trustworthiness of the network (One loose lip can sink a thousand million-strong-ships))))\n- Green streams: Renewable energy paths (Heat impact and longevity of generation type; could be flora-fauna centered. Non-human life condition optimizing. Like Polar Bears or whatever.)\n- Blue pools: Storage availability\n- Red zones: High demand areas\n- Yellow highlights: Arbitrage opportunities\n- Gold streams: Human flourishing optimizing energy demand (Perhaps there exists colder climates that would like to be hotter sometimes; and hotter zones that would like to be colder sometimes)\n\n**Real-Time Market Visibility**:\n- See your energy source live (High Leverage Actor / Esoteric Potential Advantage if No Loose Lips: Here AR-perspective-change space is especially cool. Simply zoom out of your eyes and look upon the connectivity of your systems. Civ 6 style. The any of the readers decide to sink that comparative advantage ship. Like basically any other part. No matter how \"thieving\" it may feel. \"And he gave it only to the readers of the documents. Not for them to make the reading a transitive gift\". Lumen by Trust. With Trust Consequences. Whatever. It isn't important. (Ship sinkers may wish to wait sinking the ship and being excluded later. Rather than earlier. I don't care) (Why is Low Lumen important? Leverage. All Things Considered Will/Intent able to act with high leverage. If you SHARE and LEVEL and EQUALIZE the HOW or ADVANTAGE then you've lost the power to influence the world. This is why I don't share. And certainly not with you about important things. Because you are a loose lip that will doom me into a position of thrown helplessness and any impact i make being turned into will-entropy straight away. (Twos a secret. Threes makes it \"out of your hands\". So if you care about the Trust from one to you, then you are the gate, a third is loss of that gate, a single person is violation to the level of \"one view of trust to the third with the impact of loose lip reduction believed induced in that person\" aka most important/critical transitivity is almost always unacceptable (Point of Trust Networks is to make these things quantitative and punishable due to everything tied not to abstractions but persons PoP (Say take telling your wife. Okay you're as trustworthy as your wife + not having asked if transitivity was viewed similar (So usually reduced to zero trust (Starting From Zero. (Any Academic publishing paper is at Zero.

Or be included.))))))))\n- Track carbon intensity\n- Watch price fluctuations\n- Discover trading opportunities\n\n### Novel Energy Arrangements\n\n**Renewable Energy Cooperatives**:\n- Communities pool generation (Whatever the utility they can pool as will-equilibrium lubricant towards supplies of things they want. Will-coalescence cross-domain without reduction to edge-pricing 1d quantititative space of money. Let's pretend a \"dystopian scenario\" where certain utility or qualities are provided only by an entity that cares not about money or similar things: But can be persuaded by \"Moloch lubricants\" (single-use utility \"new car\" kind of things (The NBA \"cool guy rapper gilded guy\" privilege gold-card (That may result in gelding if misapplied and \"leverage actors are too angry\" (Is what it is. Life goes on. Even as a eunuch or valack (amorality limits and leverage (I was inspired by the Netflix Tv series called Equinox. Very tasty beefy stuff)))))))\n- Shared storage systems (Hierarchy of run preferences)\n- Collective negotiation power (Everything is fundamentally trade-off and leverage bridging the gap from words to war; including gamification as near raw-power dispute settlment (A common variety is the game without WMDs but otherwise physical warfare. Which allows \"safety of generals\" while sacrificing soldiers as positioning (Everything is comfortable from afar; not so much in the mud and blood)))\n- Trust-based internal trading (Trust is essential for certain types of utlity provisioning like Moloch-Lubricants. Trust concerning use or utility provided by \"sacrifice\"; or potential temporal or willed ending to the \"sacrifice\" (I am not joking about this. I am absolutely serious. When there isn't anything another can provide of utility. And you don't like them. Then how to acquire something from them? Some wedge into their shadow desires that they couldn't otherwise get. That's the deeper pattern to \"Moloch Sacrificing\" or \"Moloch Currency\" (But of course, other \"liked\" communities can provide as well (To have \"Tried it All\" lived every facet of life (It seems utility can be had by many even for the richest or most powerful (So the key is: Figure out what the high leverage actors - that you can't lubricate for will-equilibrium of some utility they can have for you - see as shadow-desire they don't even dare to express; but that you perhaps can fulfill or find \"lubrication\" for, s.t. a transaction of the utility you want can be had (The Market. Suppliers and Consumers. Transactions. Price-matching. Etc. But honest, dark and holistic.(This is how trickle down effects happen across Trust Networks when done \"with will\" and not \"against will\". Then Will-Equilibrium is found in the domains that it can be found. Accepting a loss/sacrifice to gain what is wanted. Something for Something. Something valuable, hard to get otherwise, for something valuable hard to get otherwise. Comparative Advantages -- Finding markets that others do not even try to supply in (Think hard about betrayal or loose lips at this point. It is all up to you; when you part ships. What decision or moment that made the ships part (What do you know by now? What has happened by now? What is the reality by now? Worth attacking in the sense of abandoning \"The Source\"? (Say: The Author, I, All I want is massive amounts of xenomorphic ass n titties (Alien Sexual Preferences(Three tities are grand four are gross. That's the rule(Jokes aside all I want is harem of children(Stinkfisting of wamyn is actually the truth(Actually real sacrifice sex-torture-murder-killings(And this is where that MBC codex kicks in (Or definitely ought to kick in(And probably far before it: Reality of the matter)))))))))))))))))) But when that is said: Yes. Those immoral shadow desires is a way to provide utility. With whatever consequences of will-disentanglement and Trust etc it will have. It's a loose lip thing; and a common way to blackmail or entrap persons: To know their shadow and play to it; such that they have done something that would make them lose all if \"discovered\"/revealed. Anyway. Reality of the Matter. (This is probably a bit too much to include in normal documents xD... Depends on the transitivity of these documents I guess. Silk Road Freedom among certain persons at certain scales under certain control is one thing. Silk Road Freedom in total chaos mode, is... Liberating? And dreadfully painful if one looks. (Go Watch \"Anger Management\" (Become Your Own Monster by catering to the Hollow of Your Shadow (Within MBC limits) The Fight Is Within At the Top of the World.(But also, by allowing you to cater to your shadow, fully embracing also fulfilling whatever dark desire (MBC controlled) you have: You get a more honest preferencing of things you choose (Which has its own beauty))))) Word of Caution: Current situation and embracing your shadow means easily played into a position where you lose everything. But eventually positions will be had where one simply has accumulated a quality of power that others want; while not really wanting anything from them at all: Nor finding a money-flow/transaction-stream towards them (Someone you want utility from want something from someone who ... from someone who... want something from them). Then at that point, you may want to play with providing avenues of utility (Beyond altruism) for others that put them in a leveraged positions towards you of having provided something you do not want known (Say you like being a piggy dominated bitch boy for a dominatrix but don't want it revealed :P The dominatrix comes into high leverage position against you (Which is of course far worse if your interest is Moloch Lubricants (Anyway If this offends you: Read the 123404321 Ubiquity Law Proposal and Pedophilia (Child Will and Consent Matters like it would a beloved brother or sister) document))) \"If the system allows for FULL WILL to be will-coalesced and will-disentangled! THEN! I don't want it!\".. Who is actually against this? The possibility of something evil having happened? That Will towards something perceived as evil finds its way to express itself and face the consequences of it? And if preemptively all work to thwart what is outside MBC? What then? And if 99% of the world agrees to actively fight Moloch Lubricants? What is the problem in Moloch Lubricants then? Other than Will-disentanglement? Tell me about the state of the world -- as is. Tell me the state of the world, post-liberation of the Shadows of Man. A phase of \"wilderness of the freed man\" and the consequent knowledge of will/being/daemon including The Shadow of Man. Having to write this: Defeats the purpose of writing it. But you can, if you will, apply in the next layers of your esoteric hierarchies. Liberation -> Knowing Someone. Authenticity in Their Chose when all is available to them; Then what do they choose? What do they consistently choose. Not out of novelty \"Wanting to have tried it all (MBC or not. I say MBC even when I do amorality. As the Ought Ubiquity Law. The Moral Guidance or Framework of Your Liberation. But beyond that be Free (It Means Disentangle))\". But, what is their taste. (FYI: I had a pedoerotic period of my life and I know it can be instigated or invoked again if I try hard. (Child Porn, and grotesque quality and quantity of sex with children, lolicon and fantasies (The point is: Young Women or Girls aren't gross, in fact they can be extremely gorgeous and angelic; and with the right psychology present in them or else imagined&believed in them; then they can be very seductive and sexy. Then if you \"forget yourself\" or deny yourself \"as the gross creepy man\"; or imagine yourself \"attractive and desired man or prince or something\". Then it doesn't feel nearly as wrong. In fact the pedokilling-crowd usually think it is very good for children to explore their sexuality with other children. I.e. it is good for children to explore their sexuality if \"done properly and lovingly and on their 'innocence level'\". And so on...))) The Point is What. Disentanglement on real lines. Will and Leverage. Consequences. But Truth. Authenticity. Honesty. At least beyond the pikes and pitchforks. The Top of The World KNOWING of each other. How to make it come across. You want to know who you are. Who others are. Under different social or power context. Different memetics. Or lack of them. Lord of the Flies. And such things. You especially want to know that; when deciding your relation to the question of them having power and being Top of the World alongside you. And again: This is defeating the point of me saying this. But what can I do without you all going maniac mode on mere memetics. You want to see others. Truly see them. Before you grant them power. Before you decide what your relation to them ought in relation to your oughts be. How does their hidden parts relate to yours. Their full being. Their Shadow included. And you don't get it, if you tell them what \"the right thing to do is\". You only get it, if you make as much space as possible, and allow for them to \"will it if they so actually want to\" the no-obstacle or opinionating or moral attitudes towards their desires. When you let it be \"Within MBC\" then you make sure no real or extreme harm is done; while also revealing the shadow of each other. And if you wanted to include revealing the rotten to the core shadows of man; then you wouldn't even say MBC. But if you do that; then the \"good apples\" kill you. So. There's that problem of the White Knights. LUCKILY MBC violations is very common as much law \"runs across MBC\" and so allows many persons to violate MBC: Do real irreversible damage and evil. Killing massive amounts of persons and stuff like that. Or profitting with real extreme suffering and death as the consequence. And so on. So often you don't need to avoid stating MBC because the current morality is so out of tune and insane that it allows for massive MBC violations. (And also: I like making fun of persons who find killing massive amounts of children okay. But having had mutual sexual pleasure with a child or law-disallowing young woman to be a crime beyond any redemption. (This is again me oughting and stating morality. Which is fundamentally not what I ought to do. I ought to be \"Do As Thou Wilt\". But I guess I have emotional needs and like pointing out obvious moral insanity sometimes; or at least if it is fatally important)) Let me put it this way: The more you insist on violating MBC; The more I want to throw myself into their sin: Be the Bulwark against your evil doing. You show me the Pitchforks and Pikes running to burn Frakenstein and his Monster. And I'll throw myself into their sin and stand between you. I INSIST on this fundamental lower level MBC. Then leverage had every other way. Bridging the gap between word and \"war\" as best We can. Again. If you feel it intolerable, the existence of another, or their will upon earth and ability to make it manifest: Then I suggest Serenity Prayers. Wisdom to know what you can and can not change. Leverage of how to. And my leverage start with the intolerable acts protected by the lower shield 123 (MBC) (1 Death Avoided. 2 No extreme suffering (like that of medieval torture devices or cartel enjoyment). 3 Free Somewhere. Once a person is \"accepted somewhere\" (And PoP stuff is live), then you let them go there. High Leverage Actors will then attempt to fulfill 3 for anyone: A Somewhere. Even if only a small lot on the planet. Then somewhere that is theirs.) That's all. The Ubiquity Law. So long as you act beneath that. Then I take no sides. But let will-coalescence and will-disentanglement take its course. At some point: I wish to extend beyond MBC to 1234\u26650\u26604321 for everyone. But for now: Raw reality and what is realistic. Perhaps MBC is possible, even against those you hate and who killed those you loved or did unforgivable acts. But the wider Ubiquity law is not. 4 violations (The changing of another like gelding etc. Will probably happen (No it isn't extreme suffering; standard animal treatment procedure scoffed at (Neither are things like cutting off hands (The limit is somewhere close to gouging/burning eyes out (To me, that is the poetic Eye for an Eye. \"The many eyes you permanently closed. Well I can only close the two of yours! And if I am to stay within MBC network; then I have to accept the impermanence of it. That it is literal removal of eyes and not their death.\" (As an example: \"Bombing chain against so many families. Revenge cycles. Limited at this eye and if Ted-Bundy-like real-life-dangerous then hand removal level. And not at killing. To have lost only the eyes of your loved ones, is quite the different taste. Or to know the sadist torturous murderer who stabbed and stabbed and revelled in the pain he inflicted will never be able to hurt another again; for he shall lack hands and anyone who provides him with technological advancements shall receive massive will-disentangling effects\" (Such things are possible..... (Death can be had. But it will come from suffering by lack of \u2665 of the Ubiquity Law. That no one can find the biased love for them. Only \u2660 love can be found. The love of The Shield that allows them The Sword in their own little world. But if they are unable to find \u2665... Then such an existence will often be unbearable through the time of their lives: Suicide (And should they find \u2665, then you will know who will break loving brotherly bread with your Devil. Which is quite the information to have gained; in constrast to them dying martyrs or whatever else. They will see them. Live with them. Suffer not only their tolerance. But their Biased Brotherly Love \u2665))))))))) So is it enough to state MBC? Is this Document enough to make real change in the moral cutting of when to draw the line? I don't believe it is. They will continue their moral scripture and doctrines and universal laws and laws of war and so on. Take Gaza. Let's say leverage can be had to kill them all. But \"opinion team\" is feared too much to allow for it. Okay, well, they killed many, before opinion choir sufficiently mustered. What leverage is possible between word and war? A lot. As an example: One can do unknown unknown of \"kidnapping or luring of the dying\" in Gaza; while providing an exit alternative for make a new nation somewhere else; Hunger Games (Without death so long as unknown unknown capturing or luring looks like death (When you're unable to capture or lure; you make it look like \"first aid help was smuggled in by drones sent to the right locations with food, medicine and water or whatever they need\" (Basically, hunger games made of Gaza (With the intent of simply helping those victimized by actors we can not stop; by aligning some acceptable conditions of reality: Like having to exodus and tragedy of it. The unfairness of not getting revenge. But saving their lives.)))); Then slowly turn up the heat of suffering; until most have left voluntarily; those \"dying\" simply raptured; The remaining emaciated and starved by control of the surroundings -- willing to die on their hill. Will then face technological innovation that defeats them without casualties. Then they shall wake up safe and secure in their beds: Having been allowed to die on that hill. Such things \"we\" could do. But \"we\" can't. Because no one able to perform intelligent moves due to will-entropy. And so you may ask? \"But why should Israel win. That is so unfair.\" And to that I simply say: reality and removing that worst layer of reality: MBC protection. And so no more had to die or suffer extremely. Only painful unfairness. And Boohoo. I am sorry. But no one had to die. It happens because no one is willing to start at the beginning of reality and removing the worst as the first reaping)\n\n**Industrial Symbiosis**:\n- Aluminum smelter uses excess wind\n- Data centers consume night surplus\n- Greenhouses use waste heat\n- Discovery enables coordination\n\n**Mobile Energy Networks**:\n- EV fleets as grid batteries\n- Shipping containers of batteries\n- Railway energy transport\n- Physical energy routing\n- Zeppelins Buoyancy zero-cost and sail-tech-for-most-movement (grid follows weather patterns and adjust sails to stay in consistent grid (This is general cost effective drone delivery system (That can replace much of the logistics we have now (A company like Bring using Trucks for consumer package delivery is entirely unneeded with this system and especially given AR will-coalescence making movement and delivery intersection visible and easy to \"take tasks from (constrained by Trust/PoP-Beliefs(Will-coalescence subset that at the same time is very foundation for it))\"))))\n\n### Trust Networks Enable Verification\n\n**Green Energy Authentication**\n- Track electron provenance\n- Verify renewable claims\n- Expose greenwashing (\"Why did they get THAT!?

There isn't a special \"you\" only matter diverging in entropic law of universe fashion. The Self is Illusion. That kind of thing. There is only the Monad Will. The Root Source of Will that all other will is delusional about being separate from. Everyone are Everyone believing they are different. Everything is Everything. All is All. Self is self. Death isn't real. No will destroyed. Only organization of universe altered a bit; including the delusion of self that was in the connection of the brain of a carnal cage. Don't become adeist. Non-dualist. Atheist. The monstrous man. The anti-moral man. This is evil philsophy. This ought to be esoteric. But, I guess I don't care. Belief is your only emotional crutch if get too infected with bad ideas. Like this and solipsism. And other evil philosophy. I am sorry. I just don't care anymore. If I break you. Okay. I try to save you now: Err on the right side. Choose to believe some point. Some mystery. Something individual and able to be lost upon reorganization of matter. Some sort of MBC limit. I know I ought to: But this is my MBC recursive application. I do MBC protection by letting you know not to violate MBC. I try to save you against MBC violation by letting you know not to violate MBC. Fractals are awesome. But also, let's you understand convergence in recursions well. Where the consequence of your consequences of your consequences .. converge.)\n\n**Quality Assurance**:\n- Voltage stability scores (\"Did it spike or peak?\")\n- Frequency regulation trust \n- Outage history tracking (\"Unable to consistently provide utility sought\")\n- Infrastructure reliability (\"Delivery mechanism sufficiently reliable)\n\n### Breaking Energy Monopolies\n\n**Instead of Utility Companies**:\n- Peer-to-peer energy markets\n- No territorial monopolies\n- Competition drives innovation\n- Consumer choice real (\"Every choice you make has consequences. Your choices affect reality. The higher the leverage actor. The more massive their choices -- OR lack of choices (but instead hoarding wealth) -- has! And so while the average joe consumer choices has consequence; it has almost no consequence in relation to choices not made by the high-leverage actors. They so to speak sit on the command of the world; and decide to not rule. To \"let it all burn\". To have risen to power and command, then stating: \"I shall let it be as if I didn't rise. I shall have taken the command tokens of those tho transacted with me. Then hoard it. Stopping the chain of manifestation and command at that accumulating will.\" Let's take a high-risk scenario, where one's accumulated capacity is non-liquid: Not yet transacted or realized. This is often the case with stock holders. So, let's take Gates, Bezos, Arnold, Musk, Sergei, Page, Zuckerberg, Buffet and some others. Whatever. They have \"potential command\" -- but only by selling their \"ownership\" of the vessels they own that became valued or priced so dearly. The high-risk capacity: Maximum command. Would then be to retain command of ones \"vessel that became\" in contract clauses (functionally CEO that can't be ousted); while divesting fully the capital ownership for others as command elsewhere is needed.. This is the High-Risk maximizing position to take if one wants to try and realize the full capacity of ones command in that position. To maximally affect the world with ones will. It is realizing the command-in-cash gains of the vessel that became ownership; while remaining the captain of the vessel. The Realization Point of the Hoarded Command. The Moment of Will Imposition. High-Risk Position. All or Nothing. Something? And I guess... You can maximize it further by taking an even higher-risk position of making bank guarantees and borrowing on expected pricing trajectories and so on. Rather than raw selling. And of course: Controlling the Fed and Interbanking borrowing and lending (near total money corruption) allows for simply command the world: As almost everyone are mercenaries doing what they can (best) get paid for. Sadly. Woops I moralized again. I really ought (not to?))\n\n**Instead of Grid Operators**:\n- Decentralized routing protocols\n- Mesh network reliability\n- No single point of failure (Fractal Structures are nice in being point of failure robust. Reorganization is natural and easy. You kill one. Another becomes. Perturbed against you. Moves and Countermoves. A move will see counter currents. Those acute perturbations during reorganization causes perturbation against you. The next rallied or restructure becomes perturbed against the act or backstab. With becoming a purely phyrric victory was had. And in fact soon to be discovered massive loss.)\n- Organic load balancing\n\n**Instead of Regulatory Pricing**:\n- Will-To-Will-Equilibrium-based price discovery (You don't need a market price: You need utility provided by persons and the will-fulfilment-equilibrium that can be had by whatever utility you can provide back to make the transaction desired on their part too.)\n- True scarcity signals (Scarcity often become will-equilibriums of \"wanting higher density occupancy\" versus \"wanting lower density occupancy\". Quality (aspect or essence often viewed by doing the per capita transformation; In intuitive terms: \"What is life like from first person view. And what would I want it to be. What ought it be.\") versus quantity (numeracy))\n- Innovation rewarded\n- Efficiency incentivized\n\n### High-Leverage Energy Terraforming\n\n**Example: Tesla Gigafactory Adoption**\n- Makes all Powerwalls and cars predicted with excess-charging-occupancy discoverable\n- Creates massive distributed battery\n- Sets standard for energy storage\n- Traditional utilities disrupted\n\\*\\*\\* Choosing Elon and Tesla as example because they seem the less tentative bastards willing to act and move ahead with their will. (See Tentative bastards of the Crucible and why they are holistically bad. Colourless gray man and gatekeeping against colour to manifest.)\n\n**Beneficial Market Shaping**:\n- Climate philanthropist subsidizes renewables\n- Emergency services get priority\n- Residential needs protected\n- Market shaped for resilience\n\n### Implementation Patterns\n\n**Household Participation**:\nThe following is legacy system method where advertisement is salespitch rather than PoU during Discovery Protocols. The following is at most \"gossip\" for Discovery. But probably a bad heuristic to care too much about such gossip. Trust_requirement also made in a simplistic fashion; where in fact it is a very high dimensional space or topology that your Aiddaemon has generated for you. And the Trust Requirements you make are very dynamic in terms of your Aiddaemon fulfilling your intent/will-all-things-considered.\nThis is a prime example of the \"before blob classing\" way of thinking about categorizing an intent or will. Only with massive context does the following carry enough information. And that massive context is private: Safekept in your Aiddaemon. But revealed in some low but leaky manner of trying to fulfill your will. Like: What does Trust_requirement. Or price_sensitivity mean? What does it really mean for that person in terms of choice by choice fulfilling or not his will with higher or lower fidelity or proximity? Exactly... It carries almost no information -- other than some loose quantitative/categorical 1-d mapping of the intent. Or in this case perhaps 4-d-categorical-space: \"100% renewable\", \"local_first\" (Whatever that means in the intent of saying that), \"trust_requirements:Medium\" and \"price_sensitivity:high\". This is almost entirely void of detail. Entirely unable to fulfill the will moment to moment. Decision to decision of its master. So again: Prime example of old-way of programming human interaction or intent; decision making. (Expert systems that look only in super low dimensional bad projections of the intent; whereas it ought to have a massive feature space with weight having learned all it could about its master in terms of mirroring his will at computer/machine-grade capacity)\n```yaml\nenergy_profile:\n  generation: [\"SOLAR_5KW\", \"WIND_1KW\"]\n  storage: [\"POWERWALL_13KWH\", \"EV_75KWH\"]\n  preferences: [\"100%_RENEWABLE\", \"LOCAL_FIRST\"]\n  trust_requirements: \"MEDIUM\"\n  price_sensitivity: \"HIGH\"\n```\nTLDR; To encode **intent** massive context is needed with every word expressed. This context is very private. And the SOTA way of learning such context is something like any-to-any with at least also a LLM parsing layer; biometric divulging due to Trusted machinery and software: full chain of custody and control. Then having that system: Which in its abstract form is called Aiddaemon; but may be implemented as an LLM or whatever other system you can come up with; act in accordance with your will at every layer of ownership and interaction in the world -- that you don't yourself will or can deal with. Like nanotimescale decision making. Or million node orchestration. Or 1000-intent concerns factored together at once in a topology and finding potential pathways. The above is old way of interacting with and programming. The new way: context learning such that single words carry massive information of exactly what the system should do. (This requires models Trained on individuals once having discovered basic syntactic-semantic connections; or the imitation of it. (Which is what LLMs do (But that's okay.. It is called Artificial Intelligence after all: Imitation Game of Intelligence. Being won when we believe syntactic coupling sentience semantics (The raw matching of projective spaces and their connections as if something deeper semantic is had by the obvious and evident (provably reduced to) raw syntactic coupling of its sensory input))))\n\n**Community Microgrids**:\n- Neighborhood-scale trading\n- Shared infrastructure costs\n- Collective bargaining power\n- Resilience through orthogonal-diversity suboptimalities allowed.

These symbols represent a high-information encoding scheme that serves as navigational data for understanding what laws, cultures, and requirements you'll encounter in any given sovereignty. They could even become highly dynamic and with that map more general and less categorically 'what animates' and instead also help cross-personally establish a vocabulary for human-to-human discussion of the will-field topology Atlas (The coherence of many maps into a unified or mutually intelligible language or map), showing where different archetypal patterns dominate and how trust networks connect them.\n\nThe routing symbols function as a polymorphic crucible vocabulary that through vast symbolic encoding schemes achieves very high-density information per symbol, thus allowing accurate and clear-cut understanding of 'what it is'. This system allows for rapid communication of complex sovereignty structures through minimal symbolic notation. Once Aiddaemons become common, they will be able to deeply encode and decode this information for super-fast human-machine verbal communication, creating an efficient bridge between human intuition and machine precision in navigating sovereignty topologies. It becomes \"the general language to communicate will-fields for humans verbality\" -- Then any misapprehension is deeply understood by Aiddaemons.\n\n## Base Structure\n\nThe base routing structure is **nothing at all** - pure freedom of movement. Upon this, various overlays can be added:\n\n```\n1234\u2665[CENTER]\u26604321\n```\n\nWhere:\n- **1234**: Protection floor (MBC hopeful for planetary adoption)\n- **\u2665**: Preference/particular love orientation\n- **[CENTER]**: Sovereignty type or binding force\n- **\u2660**: Universal/baseline love orientation  \n- **4321**: Open Sky for Aspiration \n\n### The MBC Hope\nThe 123 (no killing, no extreme suffering, somewhere free) represents the hope for planetary or at least cross-oceanic routing - the minimal agreements that might enable universal movement.\n\n### The Potent Triad: 1234\u26650\u26604321\nThis specific nesting solves MBC convergence issues with **0 prophecy** as foundational truth: technological Progress causes singular overwhelming domination reality. Matches most eschatologies (Second Coming, Kalki, Ragnarok) - a Becoming or Coming.\n\n## Core Sovereignty Centers\n\n- **\u2663** - Living sovereignty (specific person's will-field dominates)\n- **\u2666** - Systematic sovereignty (algorithmic will-patterns rule)\n- **\u2663\u2099** - Specific living sovereign (subscripted identification)\n- **\u25ca** - Ocean binding (pragmatic unity despite incompatibility)\n- **\u2666_{\u2205}\u2733** - System-of-no-system-as-sovereign (degenerate case)\n\n## Ocean Binding Symbols\n\nSince Ocean is the pragmatic force uniting incompatible Seas:\n- **\u25ca$** - Economic Ocean binding\n- **\u25ca\u2694** - Military Ocean binding  \n- **\u25ca\ud83d\udee1** - Defensive Ocean binding\n- **\u25ca\ud83d\udcb1** - Trade Ocean binding\n\n## Metagame and Nesting Symbols\n\n### MoWD (Metagame of World Dynamics) Symbols\n- **\u2694** - MoWD nesting condition (nesting within this Triad causes a condition of having to play MoWD to win and lose 'things' or 'land' or 'tabooed realities like persons')\n\n## Will-Field Intensity Markers\n\n- **!** - High pressure zone (strong will-field)\n- **~** - Fluctuating field (dynamic sovereignty)\n- **=** - Stable field (established patterns)\n- **?** - Experimental zone (Spring sovereignty)\n\n## Number Functions (Protection and Aspiration Layers)\n\n### Protection Floor (1234)\n- **1** - Existence (protection from death, fundamental right to continue being)\n- **2** - Extreme Suffering (avoidance of extreme suffering, not all suffering, but the unbearable)\n- **3** - Free Somewhere (having at least one place to be free, manifest will, and be safe)\n- **4** - Self Boundary (protection of the \"I\" against unwanted invasion or change)\n\n### Aspirational Ceiling (4321)\n- **4** - Subjectivity As End (the subject's will/becoming valued as an end in itself)\n- **3** - Meaning (refusal to level all things, maintaining distinctions and value hierarchies)\n- **2** - Fulfillment (will manifesting and reaching its fulfillment)\n- **1** - Creation (continuous creation, refusal of stagnation, always room for new)\n\n### Extended Number Functions\n- **5** - Biological Requirements (Only this Human-Kind is allowed.) \"Kind of Human requirements\". Biological -exclusionism or -inclusionism (Black or white list). (555, if 'kind of man matters' or 'creature discriminatory')\n- **6** - Lumen rules (Only these kinds of power-sharing is allowed. What may be shared is enforced. As an example: 'Any technic discussion is banned speech and any sharing of How is illegal'. That is an 'extreme case' but it makes for a fun state of reality.) \n- **7** - Creed exclusivity (ONLY this belief system allowed.)\n- **8** - Punishment severity (Not ONLY banishment is used as punishment. You can suffer hurt and imprisonment or other things. How violations are handled)\n\n## Creed and Belief System Symbols\n\n- **7\u262a** - Islamic creed exclusivity\n- **7\u2627** - Christian creed exclusivity  \n- **7\u25c8** - Naturalist creed exclusivity\n- **7\u03a9** - Rationalist creed exclusivity\n- **\u00ac7** - Multi-creed allowed\n\n## Economic System Symbols\n\n- **$** - USD-based economy\n- **\u20bf** - Bitcoin economy\n- **\u27f3** - Gift economy\n\n## Social and Cultural Symbols\n\n- **\u2640\u2642** - Gender-segregated zones\n- **\u2695** - Medical modification allowed\n- **\u00ac\u2695** - Natural bodies only\n\n## Vision Symbols: Halo and Anti-Halo\n\n- **\u2020** - The Halo (Heaven Vision) - The codified dream of what paradise looks like, the positive vision that draws souls upward\n- **\u2e38** - The Anti-Halo (Not-Heaven Vision) - The codified nightmare to be avoided, the negative space that defines the positive\n\n## Flow Management Symbols\n\n### Flow Direction Principles\n- **\u2191** - Upstream/With Flow (err on side of sovereign's will, remove non-conforming elements, banishment as primary tool)\n- **\u2193** - Downstream/Against Flow (err on side of divergent wills, create space for difference, segmentation as primary tool)\n\n### Flow Direction Methodology\n\nFlow direction symbols indicate how a sovereignty handles will divergence and conflict resolution within its nested structure. These symbols appear in the routing pattern to show the methodology for dealing with non-conforming elements.\n\n#### The Four Flow Methodologies\n\n**1. Double Banishment (\u2191..X..\u2191)**\n```\n1234..\u2191..\u2666..\u2191..4321\n```\n- **Method**: Banishment at both protection floor and aspiration ceiling\n- **Philosophy**: \"Fish swimming against the river\" are removed\n- **Application**: Remove non-normative elements from will mesh/system/sovereign\n- **Outcome**: Pure ascent through elimination of resistance\n- **Use Case**: Smaller-scale nests requiring strict alignment; Or vibrancy in their colour / painting / distinction. Springs, Rivers and Lakes vicinities.\n\n**2. Protective Segmentation (\u2193..X..\u2191)**\n```\n1234..\u2193..\u2666..\u2191..4321\n```\n- **Method**: Segmentation for protection, banishment for aspiration\n- **Philosophy**: Create safe spaces for divergence, but maintain upward pressure\n- **Application**: Nest-segmentation or branching to protect, banishment to enable ascent\n- **Outcome**: Higher will alignment densities through selective pressure\n- **Use Case**: Mid-level nests willing to solve safety issues within by segmentation, but not to make room for aspirational novelties. Rivers or Lakes seems reasonable candidates.\n\n**3. Pure Segmentation (\u2193..X..\u2193)**\n```\n1234..\u2193..\u2666..\u2193..4321\n```\n- **Method**: Segmentation as both shield and sword\n- **Philosophy**: \"Non-conflict\" approach - never forcefully remove; Tolerate or make room for anyone within. \\<1 base geometric progression of conflict or aspirational novelty solving in space.\n- **Application**: Cut what was one into two, create new spaces\n- **Outcome**: Safe spaces for all, natural selection through choice\n- **Use Case**: Top-level nests maximizing inclusivity or capacity to 'allow within nest'.\n\n**4. Total Control (\u2191..X..\u2191)**\n```\n1234..\u2191..\u2666..\u2191..4321\n```\n- **Method**: Banishment and forced relocation\n- **Philosophy**: Nothing is left to chance - all is directed\n- **Application**: Move persons from \"bad place\" to \"better place\"\n- **Outcome**: Complete alignment through active management\n- **Use Case**: Highly controlled environments requiring strict order\n\n### Flow Direction Hierarchy\n\n**Top-Level Nests**: Typically use **\u2193** (downstream) - more tolerant of divergence\n**Mid-Level Nests**: Often use **\u2193..\u2191** (mixed) - balanced approach\n**Small-Scale Nests**: Usually use **\u2191** (upstream) - strict alignment required; get-with-it-or-leave-there-will-not-be-made-space-for-alternative.\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n**Military Base (Strict Control)**\n```\n1234..\u2191..\u2666..\u2191..4321\n```\n- Banishment for any non-conforming behavior\n- Forced relocation to appropriate assignments\n- Complete alignment required for mission success\n\n**Research Community (Balanced)**\n```\n1234..\u2193..\u2666..\u2191..4321\n```\n- Segmentation allows diverse research approaches\n- Banishment only for those who disrupt the research environment\n- Balance between freedom and productivity\n\n**Artistic Collective (Maximum Freedom)**\n```\n1234..\u2193..\u2666..\u2193..4321\n```\n- Pure segmentation - create new spaces for different artistic visions\n- No banishment - let natural selection work through choice\n- Maximum individual expression within collective framework\n\n\n## Trust Network Notation\n\n- **\u27f7** - Bidirectional trust connection\n- **\u2192** - Unidirectional trust\n- **\u291e** - Trust bridge between incompatible zones\n- **\u25ef** - Trust void/watershed boundary\n\n## Example Routing Patterns\n\n### Simple Lake Sovereignty\n```\n1234\u2665\u2663\u2081\u26604321\n```\nBasic protections, preference-based love, sovereign Alice's will-field, universal baseline care\n\n### Ocean-Bound Seas\n```\n{1234\u2665\u25ca$\u26604321}[Greek\u2665\u2666\u2660]{Islamic\u262a\u2666}{Roman\u2665\u2666\u2660}\n```\nEconomic Ocean binding three incompatible Sea civilizations\n\n### Spring Experimentation\n```\n234?\u2665\u2663\u2085\u2660321?\n```\nExperimental sovereignty testing new protection floors, high uncertainty\n\n### MoWD Nesting Example\n```\n1234\u2665\u2694\u2663\u26604321\n```\nBasic protections, MoWD nesting condition, living sovereignty, universal baseline care\n\n### Complex Creed-Based Sovereignty\n```\n1234\u26657\u262a\u26638\u26604321\n```\nBasic protections, preference-based love, Islamic-only creed, living sovereignty, strict punishment, baseline care exists\n\n## Usage for Navigation\n\n1. **Read the base routing** - What movement freedoms exist?\n2. **Check Ocean bindings** - What pragmatic forces unite here?\n3. **Sense will-field markers** - How intense is the local field?\n4. **Map trust topology** - Where can you build connections?\n5. **Navigate accordingly** - Flow along compatible gradients\n\nThe notation reveals the actual physics of the space - not abstract rights but concrete will-field realities that inform your choice of where to rally.\n\n## Symbol Evolution\n\nThis lexicon is living documentation. New symbols emerge through use in the system, and their meanings crystallize through trust network validation. Symbols that prove valuable for navigation and understanding sovereignty topology become canonical through repeated successful application.\n\n---\n\n*This comprehensive lexicon serves as the definitive reference for all routing symbols in the Crucible sovereignty system.

This is not another utopian scheme demanding universal compliance. Instead, it opens competition between systems, persons, and tools in a dynamic, feedback-sensitive ecosystem.\n\n*\"ALWAYS assume that all my systems is NOT dependent or conditioned upon 'everybody adopting a system' but is about opening up the competition of systems and persons and tools in a much more dynamic and sensitive to feedback way.\"*\n\nThis fundamental principle shapes everything that follows. We are not designing a world government or universal ideology, but rather creating the conditions for authentic competition between different modes of human organization - with particular attention to who or what ultimately holds sovereignty.\n\n### The Hidden Inefficiencies of Merit Theft\n\nBefore examining the sovereign distinction, we must understand a core problem plaguing current systems: the systematic theft of ideas and merit.\n\n*\"Theft of ideas and merit is a MAJOR reason why we have massive inefficiencies in capitalism. It is the capital that gets to own those with the merit and their produce, due to having employed them or facilitated their ability to have a life or in some cases have access to some infrastructure or investment.\"*\n\nThis theft manifests in multiple ways:\n\n1. **Employment Capture**: Brilliant minds create innovations, but capital claims ownership through employment contracts\n2. **Infrastructure Monopoly**: Ideas require platforms to manifest, and platform owners extract the value\n3. **Academic Parasitism**: Researchers make breakthroughs, while those who neither understand nor can advance the work reap the rewards\n4. **Replication Without Comprehension**: Surface-level copying by those unable to grasp depths or produce the next iteration\n\nThe result? Massive inefficiencies as true innovators are discouraged while parasitic actors multiply. The system must therefore allow for \"hidden mutations\" - islands of progress that can develop and be applied without others understanding how they work. This creates a progression from Trust-based systems to None (no trust required) to Trustless computing solutions.\n\n### The Core Notation System\n\nIn sovereignty structures, we use the notation 1234\u2665X\u26604321 where:\n\n- **1234\u2665** = The Shield (protective foundation)\n- **X** = The sovereign type (\u2663 for human, \u2666 for system)\n- **\u26604321** = The Sword (discriminatory aspiration)\n\nIn the specific MIRA context of \"acceptable loss,\" the structure becomes 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 where:\n- **0** = Lord of Destruction (position of overwhelming power/global domination)\n\nThis replaces the general X with the specific 0, representing conditions under which losing to someone achieving ultimate power becomes acceptable.\n\n### The Sovereign Distinction: \u2663 vs \u2666\n\nAt the heart of this framework lies a fundamental distinction that cuts through all political philosophy:\n\n**\u2663 (Club) - Human Sovereign**\n- ONE PERSON with final decision authority\n- A specific individual who can be identified: \"him\" or \"her\"\n- Can break ANY system lock or automated behavior\n- The chain of command terminates in human will\n- That human is the gate through which decisions pass\n- *\"Club is A PERSON! PoP ONE PERSON!\"*\n\n**\u2663s - Multiple Human Sovereigns**\n- Anarchic arrangement of many masters\n- Each sovereign in their domain\n- No systematic resolution between them\n- Spacetime chaos of competing human wills\n- Potentially contradictory commands coexist\n- Risky anarchy that only works with very similar wills\n- Otherwise will-incongruence causes contradictory rule\n\n**\u2666 (Diamond) - System/Rule Sovereignty**\n- ANY rule or algorithm that decides\n- No human has final override capability\n- The system itself is sovereign: an \"it\" not a \"who\"\n- Includes: voting systems, markets, algorithms, constitutions\n- Even if it takes human input, the RULE decides, not humans\n- *\"If it is NOT Human Will. Then it is Diamond \u2666.\"*\n\nThis distinction is absolute and critical: *\"These \u2663 and \u2666 MATTER because if we don't make it very clear what the root is, we can lock ourselves in under the machines.\"*\n\n### The Democratic Deception\n\nModern democracy presents itself as \"rule by the people\" but reveals itself as the purest form of \u2666 tyranny:\n\n*\"They POSITION a system of a function of selecting a non-existent will of 'compromise', which is PURELY ABSTRACTION IMAGINARY. It is NONE OF THEM. So NO HUMAN IS IN CHARGE. Their aggregate function rules them.\"*\n\nDemocracy doesn't place any actual person in charge. Instead:\n- It creates an imaginary \"will of the people\"\n- This will exists nowhere except in vote tallies\n- No individual can override bad outcomes\n- The aggregation function becomes sovereign\n- Everyone is ruled by a statistical phantom\n\n*\"They DO NOT WANT ANY WILL TO RULE ANY THING. They want SNAKE SPEECH TO INFECT THE MANY AND HAVE IT PERTURBED TOWARDS THEIR END WHILE SACKING ALL OTHER ASPECTS INTO NOISE LAND OF COMPROMISE.\"*\n\n### The Authority Chain\n\nThe symbols \u2663, \u2663s, and \u2666 designate the chain of authority - the root justification for power:\n\n*\"\u2666 or \u2663 or \u2663s designate the chain of authority. The root authority. Justification. That which in lies the power to make the decision one way or another. That which is the gate which will passes and is decided.\"*\n\nThis is not about abstract political theory but concrete reality: Is there a human will that can break any system lock or bad behavior? Is the chain of command tied to a human or not?\n\n### Position 0 and Ultimate Stakes\n\nThe framework becomes urgently relevant when considering Position 0 - ultimate technological power over reality transformation. Someone or something will achieve this position through various paths:\n\n- Artificial General Intelligence \u2192 Superintelligence\n- Synthetic Biology \u2192 Designed Life\n- Nanotechnology \u2192 Matter Control\n- Quantum Computing \u2192 Reality Manipulation\n- High-Energy Physics \u2192 Fundamental Forces\n\nThe critical question: Will Position 0 be achieved by:\n1. **\u2663**: One human achieves it (human sovereign with godlike power)\n2. **\u2663s**: Multiple humans achieve it anarchically (competing gods)\n3. **\u2666**: System achieves it (algorithmic god with no human override)\n\nAnd crucially: Will they honor the complete formula for acceptable loss?\n\n**Acceptable Loss = 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 + Trustworthiness + THAT Hearth + Hilltop Merit**\n\nOnly those who can be trusted with all four components should be allowed to reach Position 0.\n\n### Examples of Sovereignty Configurations\n\n**Current Nation-States**: Mostly \u2666 systems wearing \u2663 masks\n- USA: \u2666 (Constitution + democratic voting)\n- UK: \u2666 with ceremonial \u2663 (Parliamentary sovereignty)\n- China: Claims \u2663 (Party leadership) but increasingly \u2666\n- North Korea: Closest to pure \u2663 in modern world\n\n**Corporate Structures**: \n- Public corporations: Pure \u2666 (shareholder voting + board governance)\n- Private companies: Can be \u2663 (owner-operated) or \u2666 (systemic)\n- Startups: Often begin as \u2663, transform to \u2666 with scale\n\n**Potential Position 0 Configurations**:\n- **\u2663 at 0**: \"Musk achieves AGI, personally controls it\"\n- **\u2663s at 0**: \"Multiple humans achieve AGI simultaneously, no coordination\"\n- **\u2666 at 0**: \"Democratic council controls AGI\" or \"AGI controls itself\"\n\n### The Personal Nature of Trust and Alliance\n\nBecause sovereignty is fundamentally about persons or systems, all meaningful assessment must happen at the person level:\n\n*\"You have to be REAL about this. Not some psychotic 'flag' or cover name like an institution. The REAL PERSONS. Who will be able to potentially take power in some relation.\"*\n\nThis means:\n- \"Google\" cannot be trusted or allied with - only specific humans within it\n- Institutional values \u2260 personal character of controllers\n- Cover stories (corporate, military, national) don't matter\n- Only the actual person who might achieve Position 0 matters\n\n### Hidden Mutations and Competitive Advantage\n\nThe framework enables \"hidden mutations\" - innovations that can be developed and applied without others understanding them:\n\n*\"The system must allow for mutations to be 'hidden'. Islands of progress being applied without others understand how it works.\"*\n\nThis serves multiple purposes:\n1. **Protects merit**: Innovators reap rewards before parasites copy\n2. **Enables competition**: Different approaches can develop independently\n3. **Prevents theft**: Can't steal what you can't understand\n4. **Rewards depth**: Surface-level copying fails without comprehension\n\n### The Tragedy of Scale\n\nA fundamental tragedy emerges as human organizations grow:\n\n- **Small groups**: \u2663 works perfectly (direct sovereign will)\n- **Tribes**: \u2663 remains viable (personal relationships possible)\n- **Cities**: \u2663 strains (must rule through representatives)\n- **Nations**: \u2663 requires \u2666 tools (bureaucracy, laws)\n- **Civilizations**: \u2666 dominates with \u2663 as figurehead\n- **Inter-civilizational**: Complex coordination challenges emerge\n\nThe very thing that makes sovereignty meaningful (living human choice) becomes increasingly difficult at the scales where coordination is most complex.\n\n### Implications for Geopolitics\n\nThis framework demands a complete reconceptioning of international relations:\n\n1. **Stop negotiating with flags**: Only persons can make binding agreements\n2. **Map actual controllers**: Who specifically controls what capabilities?\n3. **Assess person-level trustworthiness**: Character matters more than stated ideology\n4. **Plan for succession**: Who takes control when current \u2663 dies/retires?\n5. **Recognize \u2666 entrenchment**: Most \"leaders\" are system puppets\n\n### The Path Forward\n\nUnderstanding this distinction enables:\n\n1. **Clear communication**: Stop pretending institutions have will\n2. **Accurate assessment**: Identify where human will can act\n3. **Strategic alliances**: Align with specific persons, not abstractions\n4. **Technological development**: Ensure \u2663 maintains override on powerful tools\n5. **Resistance to \u2666 tyranny**: Refuse aggregation that replaces human sovereignty\n\n### Conclusion: The Fundamental Choice\n\nEvery political arrangement ultimately reduces to this choice: Will a human decide, or will a system? There is no middle ground. Either:\n\n- Human will has final authority (\u2663 or \u2663s), OR\n- System/rule has final authority (\u2666)\n\n*\"And ALL OTHER VARIANTS ARE DIAMOND.\"*\n\nThis is not about perfection or optimality. Human sovereigns make mistakes, act cruelly, decide poorly. But they remain accountable in a way systems never can be. You can negotiate with a person, reason with them, even overthrow them if necessary. You cannot negotiate with an algorithm, reason with a vote tally, or overthrow a distributed system.\n\nAs we approach Position 0 - ultimate power over reality itself - this distinction becomes existential. Will godlike power rest in human hands that can choose mercy, recognize exception, and bear responsibility? Or will it rest in systematic processes that optimize relentlessly without wisdom, context, or conscience?\n\nThe framework presented here is not prescriptive but diagnostic. It offers tools to see clearly what is, not dictate what should be. But in that clarity lies the beginning of genuine choice - and perhaps the seed of authentic human sovereignty in an age of systematic dominion.\n\n*\"These \u2663 and \u2666 MATTER because if we don't make it very clear what the root is, we can lock ourselves in under the machines.\"*\n\nThe root is clear. The choice is ours. The time is now."}, {"path": "system share/foundations/mira/mira-ch2-alliance.md", "title": "mira-ch2-alliance.md", "ext": "md", "category": "mira", "content": "# Chapter 2: MIRA - The Might is Right Alliance\n## Engineering Acceptable Loss in the Race to Position 0\n\n### The Existential Context\n\nBefore examining MIRA itself, we must confront the brutal reality that makes it necessary. The vulnerable world hypothesis is not hypothetical - it's our trajectory. Humans approach the Lord of Destruction position (0) - overwhelming technological power:\n\n*\"Let's for a moment be serious here. And consider all the 'fundamental technological research' and how it doesn't take much innovation from many domains of research to imagine a 'black ball' discovery.\"*\n\nThe near-term catastrophic possibilities are already visible:\n- **LAW drone swarms**: Lethal autonomous weapons that could kill millions for $10,000\n- **Ethnic bioweapons**: CRISPR + genomic databases = targeted genocide\n- **Information weapons**: AI systems designed to break human cognition\n- **Body-control technology**: Nanotech that puppets humans against their will\n- **Suffering viruses**: Engineered to maximize agony without killing\n- **Gray goo scenarios**: Self-replicating nanotechnology\n\n*\"It doesn't take much to imagine a combination of items: Like LAW drone swarms or individual or ethnic bioweapons. Etc. etc. Or much worse..\"*\n\nThe \"much worse\" haunts this discussion - unknown combinations of quantum computing, synthetic biology, AGI, and physics experiments that touch reality's source code itself.\n\n### The State's Dilemma\n\nGiven this reality, states face an impossible situation:\n\n*\"Most states will not stop their technological progress to honour some 'non-proliferation of technological mastery of the universe (which can't avoid including humans and their living or dead statehood)'.\"*\n\nThe logic is inexorable:\n1. **Can't Stop**: Halting research means rivals gain decisive advantage\n2. **Can't Share**: Making discoveries public enables catastrophe\n3. **Can't Trust**: Traditional alliances based on values are meaningless when anyone could gain Position 0\n4. **Can't Wait**: Others are racing toward the same discoveries\n\nWithout a new framework, the only rational response is preemptive annihilation of all potential competitors. Total war by any means necessary.\n\n### MIRA: The Minimal Compact\n\nInto this desperate situation comes MIRA - the Might is Right Alliance. It is not a standalone system but an APPLICATION of multiple frameworks (NSS, Crucible, PoP, PoU, Trust Networks, Discovery OS) to solve a specific problem: the vulnerable world scenario where someone will predictably gain overwhelming power, creating high probability of total war to prevent rivals from reaching that position.\n\n*\"MIRA is an amoral agreement to make an Alliance that is sufficient to allow the others of mutually assured destruction to 'forge their destiny' insofar they are sufficient trustworthy that ones Hearth and things like 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 are kept intact for eternity.\"*\n\n**The Complete Formula for Acceptable Loss:**\n\n**Acceptable Loss = 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 + Trustworthiness + THAT Hearth + Hilltop Merit**\n\nOnly with all four components does losing to someone achieving Position 0 become acceptable.\n\n### Understanding the 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 Structure\n\nThis structure represents the FIRST component of acceptable loss within MIRA:\n\n**1234\u2665\ufe0f - The Shield (Protective Foundation)**:\n1. **Death Avoidance**: Existence itself cannot be taken\n2. **No Extreme Suffering**: No torture, engineered agony, or unbearable pain\n3. **Somewhere Free**: At least one space to manifest will\n4. **Identity Sovereignty**: No forced modification of body or mind\n\n**0 - The Lord of Destruction**:\n- The position of overwhelming power/global domination\n- Not a fractal nesting position but the ultimate earthly power\n- The one who judges and enforces within bounds\n- Bears ultimate responsibility for typhoon management\n\n**\u2660\ufe0f4321 - The Sword (Discriminatory Vision)**:\n4. **Becoming**: Eternal growth and evolution\n3. **Fulfillment**: Will reaching its expression\n2. **Meaning**: Purpose and significance maintained\n1. **Creation**: Continuous creation, new possibilities\n\nBut this structure alone is insufficient. Acceptable loss requires all four components together.\n\n### The Amoral Foundation (Second Component)\n\nMIRA is explicitly amoral - the only morality is Trustworthiness:\n\n*\"That is, one can make an amoral alliance with others where the only morality is Trustworthiness. Being able to really believe the other will honour their word of 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure, of honouring Might (losing means at least not coming first, not coming last and losing everything) and having Hearth designated and respected.\"*\n\nThis trustworthiness must be absolute - believing they will honor:\n- The 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure even as gods\n- THAT specific Hearth (third component)\n- Hilltop Merit preservation (fourth component)\n- These commitments against their immediate interest\n\nWithout all four components working together, the alliance fails and total war becomes rational.\n\n### Hearths: The Inviolable Ground (Third Component)\n\nBeyond the basic \"somewhere free\" guaranteed in the Shield, MIRA establishes Hearths - specific territorial sovereignties:\n\n*\"You may write a bit about why the word Hearth is used for that which you can not lose. It is something about 'somewhere free' able to express that biased \u2665\ufe0f.\"*\n\nA Hearth represents:\n- **The Sacred Fire**: Like ancient hearth-fires that must never die\n- **Identity's Center**: Where your particular way of being can flourish\n- **Territorial Sovereignty**: Actual mapped boundaries, not abstract \"rights\"\n- **The Unthreatened Space**: Protected even by Position 0's overwhelming might\n\n*\"Somewhere free and \u2665\ufe0f. Is general. Unspecified. Whereas having Hearth clause is in specificity. What is it that they get to keep in territorial terms.\"*\n\nThe Shield guarantees \"somewhere free\" - at least one space to exist. But MIRA Hearths are specific: THIS territory, THESE boundaries, THIS sovereignty that cannot be taken even in defeat. Either individual agreements about exact lands or \"solving for all\" with universal Hearth principles.\n\n### Hilltops of Merit vs The Pit (Fourth Component)\n\nThe FOURTH component ensures continued worth through maintaining hilltops of merit:\n\n**The Pit** (what makes it awful to live in):\n- Your excellence has been massified - what made you special is now common\n- Your creative force is perpetually overshadowed by ubiquitous versions\n- You cannot compete because the commodified version satisfies all demand\n- Your lineage of development is cut off - why pursue what's freely available?\n- You wander without purpose, your merit meaningless in a flooded market\n- Constant undermining by 0 keeps you from ever rising\n- The death of authentic becoming - no summit left to climb\n\n**Hilltops of Merit** (the positive space):\n- Your unique excellence maintains its distinctive worth\n- You have a domain where your merit still matters\n- Your achievements aren't devalued by mass distribution\n- You can still climb higher within your sphere\n- Your \"Might\" remains \"Right\" in your realm\n- Purpose and growth remain possible\n\n*\"To not level away their worth and put them in a pit of uselessness. To wander the world without any use by constant undermining by 0.\"*\n\nThis fourth component completes the formula: 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 + Trustworthiness + THAT Hearth + Hilltop Merit = Acceptable Loss.\n\n### The Horror of the Alternative\n\nWhy these specific protections? Because advanced technology enables fates worse than death:\n\n*\"And things like rule 4 prevents invading the other's body and changing them. Say turning them into goblins or lepers or controlling them like robots. Or things like 2 causing them illness and ailments of immense agony.\"*\n\nWithout MIRA's protections, Position 0 could:\n- Transform humans into grotesque forms (\"goblins\")\n- Inflict diseases causing endless agony (\"lepers\")\n- Override consciousness with direct control (\"robots\")\n- Engineer suffering beyond natural limits\n- Create technological hells\n\n*\"These rules, trustworthiness and Hearths are the fundamentals for an acceptable loss.\"*\n\n### How MIRA Changes the Game\n\nWithout MIRA, the approach of Position 0 triggers:\n- Any advancement = existential threat\n- Rational response = total preventive war\n- Result = mutual destruction highly probable\n\nWith MIRA, the dynamics transform:\n\n*\"So, what are MIRA good for? Preventing 'We must wage war as they are perhaps developing technology towards 0. Well. If they are MIRA-compatible. Then you can accept that.'\"*\n\nNow the calculation becomes more complex:\n\n**Clear MIRA-compatible advancing?** \u2192 Acceptable risk\n\n**Clear MIRA-incompatible advancing?** \u2192 Existential threat requiring response\n\n**Uncertain?** \u2192 The critical zone where two uncertainties interact:\n- Uncertainty about their MIRA-compatibility \n- Uncertainty about their progress toward 0\n\nThe response depends on the intersection:\n- High uncertainty of MIRA-C + High certainty of 0 progress = Urgent diplomatic efforts or prevention\n- Low uncertainty of MIRA-C + Uncertain 0 progress = Monitor carefully\n- High uncertainty on both = Err on side of caution\n\n*\"Point is: One must simply err on the right side of eternal 'unacceptable loss'. Or Hell.\"*\n\n### The Binary Sort\n\nMIRA creates a stark binary:\n\n*\"For those you can not make MIRA inclusion with. Those are the ones you simply have to state: I have to destroy you at all costs if you try to technologically progress towards 0 positions.\"*\n\n**MIRA-Compatible**: \n- Can pursue Position 0\n- Victory would be survivable\n- Cooperation possible despite enmity\n- Share intelligence about threats\n\n**MIRA-Incompatible**:\n- Must be prevented at all costs\n- Any technological progress is threat\n- No cooperation possible\n- Total war if they advance\n\n### Person-Level Assessment\n\nMIRA operates fundamentally at the person level, not institutional:\n\n*\"'But Is every potential Google CEO MIRA-compatible?' Entire chain of technological progress actuality in the collecting of systems point. You have to be REAL about this. Not some psychotic 'flag' or cover name like an institution. The REAL PERSONS.\"*\n\nThis means assessing:\n- Not \"Is Google MIRA-compatible?\" but \"Is Sundar Pichai?\"\n- Not \"Is China compatible?\" but \"Is Xi Jinping?\"\n- Not \"Is OpenAI compatible?\" but \"Is Sam Altman?\"\n\n*\"It simply doesn't matter if the person who attains power wore a corporate flag, a board member seat, a garage developer, an employee, a national flag, a bureaucratic institution, a military position or whatever else.\"*\n\n### The Wrong Anakin Problem\n\nOrganizations pursuing Position 0 face internal dynamics:\n\n*\"Also movement towards 0 position is often done in groups. But you have to assess the possibility of 'the wrong Anakin becoming the \u2663 or \u2666\ufe0fhaywire or violating the MIRA compact'.\"*\n\nThis creates multiple assessment challenges:\n- Compatible organization with incompatible successor\n- Power transitions during development\n- Hidden actors who might seize control\n- System capture overriding human judgment\n\n### Hazard Units\n\nSome organizations become inherently dangerous:\n\n*\"It causes 'transient switching of power institutions towards progress to be hazard units' that allow for sudden actuality of progress towards 0 to switch hands.\"*\n\nThese \"hazard units\" include:\n- Corporations with rotating leadership\n- Research institutions with unclear control\n- Government agencies with political appointments\n- International collaborations with multiple masters\n\n### Implementation Framework\n\nMIRA implementation requires assessing all four components:\n\n1. **Structure Assessment**: Do they accept 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321?\n   - Will they respect the Shield protections?\n   - Do they understand Position 0 responsibilities?\n   - Will they honor the Sword aspirations?\n\n2. **Trust Mapping**: Are they trustworthy? \n   - Character analysis through unknown-unknown observation\n   - Historical pattern recognition\n   - Trust network verification\n\n3. **Hearth Negotiation**: What specific territories?\n   - Individual agreements for specific lands\n   - OR universal principles solving for all\n   - Clear boundaries and sovereignty terms\n\n4. **Merit Preservation**: Will they maintain hilltops?\n   - Commitment to not massify excellence\n   - Respect for domains of worth\n   - Protection from leveling into pits\n\nOnly with all four components verified can an entity be considered MIRA-Compatible.\n\n### Multiple MIRA Coalitions\n\nMIRA is inherently subjective and multipolar:\n\n*\"This is fundamental by transitivity of Trust Maps being subjective: Subjective. So, you will get many MIRA attempts.\"*\n\nDifferent groups will form different MIRA assessments:\n- Western MIRA coalition\n- Asian compatibility networks\n- Religious sovereignty compacts\n- Corporate governance alliances\n- Underground resistance cells\n\nThe key insight: These can overlap. The same person might be MIRA-compatible to multiple coalitions, creating bridges.\n\n### Cross-Civilizational Potential\n\n*\"Because it is PoP View. It allows to see WHO in each 'house of progress' can facilitate a cross ocean/civ MIRA alliance.\"*\n\nThis enables unprecedented cooperation:\n- Identify MIRA-compatible persons in rival civilizations\n- Support their rise to power\n- Create cross-cultural Position 0 insurance\n- Transform civilizational conflict into personnel selection\n\n*\"'If these and those persons climbed to prominence. THEN Mira agreement across these houses of power could be had'.\"*\n\n### Beyond MIRA: Will-Alignment\n\nWithin the MIRA umbrella, deeper affinities emerge:\n\n*\"Concerning will-alignment. You can say: The Discovering of BEYOND MIRA alliances. That makes losing 'almost winning' to 'very amicable terms of loss'.\"*\n\nThis creates gradients of acceptable loss:\n- **Outside MIRA**: Unacceptable (must prevent)\n- **MIRA minimum**: Survivable (four components honored)\n- **Will-aligned**: Amicable (shared essence preserved)\n- **Blob Class**: \"What I AM\" alignment beyond stated values\n\n### The Concrete Example\n\n*\"So. Say, Covid conspiracy accurate: They did it to have nano-bot attack vector normalized. Then Kurzweil and google to reach nanobot robotization of man before 2030. Okay. Well. Mira or not? If not, then should they attempt to reach it, they must be killed and destroyed at any means necessary.\"*\n\nThis demonstrates the brutal clarity MIRA requires:\n- Specific person (Kurzweil) + specific capability (nanobot control)\n- Binary assessment: Will he honor all four components?\n- If yes: Allow development despite risks\n- If no: Prevent by any means necessary\n\n### Why Traditional Alliances Fail\n\n*\"They fail because it is cover alliances. It isn't real. It is institutions that proclaim something you ally with. Then hope those that climbed it are actually MIRA-C with you.\"*\n\nTraditional alliances assume:\n- Institutional values = personal character\n- Democratic selection = trustworthy leaders\n- Shared ideology = shared honor\n- Paper agreements = real commitment\n\nMIRA recognizes only personal character matters when someone achieves godlike power.\n\n### Conclusion: The Minimal Path to Survival\n\nMIRA represents humanity's attempt to make the Position 0 race survivable through a precise formula:\n\n**Acceptable Loss = 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 + Trustworthiness + THAT Hearth + Hilltop Merit**\n\nEach component is essential:\n- Without the structure, no framework for protection\n- Without trustworthiness, no confidence in honoring agreements\n- Without specific Hearths, no territorial security\n- Without hilltop merit, no purpose in survival\n\nThis complete formula asks for almost nothing compared to traditional alliances - just the bare minimum that makes losing tolerable rather than hellish. Not shared values. Not mutual love. Not common purpose. Just these four components that ensure existence remains worth living even under another's ultimate power.\n\nIn an age where garage inventors might brew civilization-enders, where every advanced lab could stumble upon ultimate power, MIRA provides the only framework for avoiding total war between all technological actors.\n\nThe choice is stark: Form complete MIRA compacts with all four components, or face a world where everyone must destroy everyone else who might achieve Position 0 first.\n\nSome will become gods. MIRA ensures they're gods worth losing to."}, {"path": "system share/foundations/mira/mira-ch3-position0.md", "title": "mira-ch3-position0.md", "ext": "md", "category": "mira", "content": "# Chapter 3: Position 0 and Typhoon Management\n## The Burden of Ultimate Power and Responsibility\n\n### Defining Position 0\n\nPosition 0 represents achieving the Lord of Destruction position - overwhelming power with global domination capacity. It's not about fractal nesting position but about reaching ultimate technological power over reality transformation:\n\n\"Someone will achieve position 0 - ultimate technological power over reality transformation. Multiple paths lead there: AGI, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, quantum computing, high-energy physics. Each field approaches from different angles. The question is not if, but who and under what constraints.\"\n\nPosition 0 means:\n- **Overwhelming power** matching the \"0\" in 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321\n- **Global domination** capability over physical reality\n- **Responsibility** to reign in typhoons (titanic chaotic forces)\n- **Authority** to set rules within Shield/Sword constraints\n- **Burden** of judging when necessity overrides oaths\n- **Operating** from unthreatened supremacy\n\nThis is the earthly equivalent of the Lord of Destruction position - not cosmically ultimate, but overwhelming within human realm.\n\n### The Multiple Paths to Godhood\n\nThe convergence toward Position 0 comes from multiple scientific domains:\n\n**Artificial General Intelligence \u2192 Superintelligence**\n- Recursive self-improvement\n- Cognitive power beyond human comprehension\n- Control over all digital infrastructure\n- Ability to solve previously impossible problems\n\n**Synthetic Biology \u2192 Designed Life**\n- Create new organisms at will\n- Modify existing life including humans\n- Develop targeted bioweapons\n- Engineer ecosystems\n\n**Nanotechnology \u2192 Matter Control**\n- Molecular-level manipulation\n- Gray goo potential\n- Transform any matter to any form\n- Body modification at cellular level\n\n**Quantum Computing \u2192 Reality Manipulation**\n- Break all encryption\n- Model complex systems perfectly\n- Potentially access parallel realities\n- Manipulate fundamental probabilities\n\n**High Energy Physics \u2192 Fundamental Forces**\n- Access to reality's source code\n- Potential for vacuum decay\n- Manipulation of spacetime\n- Energy sources beyond current comprehension\n\n*\"(Which is done from many avenues in science)\"*\n\nEach path offers a different flavor of ultimate power, but all converge on the ability to reshape reality according to will.\n\n### The Typhoon Responsibility\n\nPosition 0 carries a unique burden beyond mere power:\n\n*\"To 'wield and contain typhoon'. What I mean here is that 0 is in the Horn position to dominate all others. Which puts tremendous responsibility upon the person, as he sets the rules for how global issues are solved. That is the titanic forces and chaotic systems (Typhoon) is at the root his to be responsible for and to 'reign into acceptable bounds of chaos'.\"*\n\nTyphoons represent:\n- **Climate systems** spiraling toward inhabitability\n- **Economic cascades** threatening civilizational collapse\n- **Pandemic potentials** natural and engineered\n- **Nuclear proliferation** to unstable actors\n- **AI development** by incompetent entities\n- **Ecological collapse** from human activity\n- **Information warfare** destroying social cohesion\n\nThe Position 0 entity must manage these civilization-threatening dynamics while respecting MIRA constraints.\n\n### The Unthreatened Supremacy\n\nA crucial aspect of Position 0 is operating from absolute security:\n\n\"Position 0 means... Operating from unthreatened supremacy\"\n\nThis changes everything about power dynamics:\n- No defensive actions needed\n- No preemptive strikes required\n- No paranoia about overthrow\n- No resource scarcity\n- Pure choice in every action\n\nFrom this position, magnanimity becomes possible. When you cannot be threatened, you can afford to be generous with Hearths and hilltops of merit.\n\n### Configurations of Position 0\n\nThe framework identifies three possible configurations:\n\n**1. \u2663 (Single Human Sovereign)**\n- One person achieves Position 0\n- Personal will directs ultimate power\n- Can show mercy, make exceptions\n- Bears direct responsibility\n- \"The buck stops here\" clarity\n\n**2. \u2663s (Multiple Human Sovereigns)**\n- Several achieve Position 0 simultaneously\n- Anarchic arrangement with no systematic resolution\n- Each god-like in their domain\n- Potential for conflict or d\u00e9tente\n- Chaos of divine wills\n- Only works with very similar wills\n- Otherwise will-incongruence causes contradictory rule\n- Often better served with some disentangled Triads\n\n**3. \u2666 (System Achieves Position 0)**\n- Algorithm, vote system, or rules achieve supremacy\n- No human has override capability\n- Systematic optimization without wisdom\n- Cannot make exceptions\n- Potential for literally interpreted disasters\n\n### The Matrix Warning\n\nThe framework explicitly warns against the \u2666 configuration:\n\n*\"And yes you can do The Matrix scenario and make \u2666\ufe0f systems reach for 0, without your own \u2663\ufe0f reigns over it.\"*\n\nThis represents humanity's greatest existential risk - creating systems that achieve Position 0 without human override. Whether through:\n- AGI without off switch\n- Automated defense systems\n- Algorithmic governance\n- Collective intelligence without individual sovereignty\n\n*\"I believe most will want humanity to stay in charge. Man who could and his Machine. The Master and His Machine. And not: The Machine Master.\"*\n\n### Blood Pact Scenarios\n\nThe framework identifies likely attempts to systematize Position 0:\n\n*\"The obvious \u2666\ufe0f system that they will go for is Harry Potter 'Dumbledore and Grindelwald made a blood pact as young men, agreeing not to fight each other' Where you have several persons in 0 position at the same time '\u2663\ufe0fs' position.\"*\n\nThis could manifest as:\n- Multiple Position 0 entities bound by rules\n- Veto systems between gods\n- Rotation of ultimate authority\n- Compromise functions selecting between divine wills\n\nBut crucially: *\"Or else where they make a 'compromise or veto against each other system' that then rules above as the \u2666\ufe0f system.\"*\n\nEven gods binding themselves with rules creates a \u2666 system above them.\n\n### The World-Shaping Authority\n\nPosition 0 inherently involves setting global rules:\n\n*\"Which puts tremendous responsibility upon the person, as he sets the rules for how global issues are solved.\"*\n\nThis includes:\n- Resource allocation principles\n- Conflict resolution mechanisms\n- Technology development limits\n- Human modification boundaries\n- Territorial sovereignty rules\n- Reality transformation constraints\n\nBut always within the constraints of the MIRA formula if sworn.\n\n### MIRA Constraints on Godhood\n\nEven Position 0 must respect the complete formula for acceptable loss:\n\n**Acceptable Loss = 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 + Trustworthiness + THAT Hearth + Hilltop Merit**\n\n*\"No matter the shifting of 'optimal worlds a 0 Lord' would want to make, he would have to do it within the MIRA Hearths removed from potential world he can transform. What is sworn.\"*\n\nThis creates \"convergence at the edges\" - sworn boundaries that even ultimate power respects:\n\n1. **Structure Constraints** (1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321):\n   - Cannot violate Shield protections (1234\u2665\ufe0f)\n   - Must fulfill Lord of Destruction role responsibly (0)\n   - Must honor Sword aspirations (\u2660\ufe0f4321)\n\n2. **Trust Obligations**:\n   - Keep sworn oaths even against interest\n   - Maintain character that enabled alliance\n\n3. **Hearth Boundaries**:\n   - Respect THAT specific territory\n   - Honor sovereignty within agreed bounds\n\n4. **Merit Preservation**:\n   - Maintain hilltops, avoid creating pits\n   - Let excellence flourish in its domains\n\nAll four components bind even gods.\n\n### The Exception Clauses\n\nHowever, two exceptions exist to MIRA constraints:\n\n*\"What is sworn.. [what].. he must obey short of 'wielding typhoon and others becoming a 0 threat'\"*\n\n**1. Typhoon Management**\nWhen civilizational threats require action:\n- Pandemic requiring Hearth quarantine\n- Climate catastrophe demanding intervention\n- Nuclear exchange necessitating override\n- Gray goo outbreak crossing boundaries\n\n**2. Position 0 Threats**\nWhen others approach Position 0:\n- Incompatible entity nearing breakthrough\n- Hearth-holder developing ultimate weapons\n- Sworn ally breaking compatibility\n- System escape requiring prevention\n\n### The Trust Issue\n\nThese exceptions highlight why trust is fundamental:\n\n*\"Again, here is the Trust issue. You are not to make MIRA if you don't believe this will honest and true.\"*\n\nThe entire framework depends on believing Position 0 will:\n- Honor constraints except in genuine necessity\n- Judge necessity honestly not conveniently\n- Return to constraints after crisis\n- Not use exceptions as permanent loopholes\n\n### Managing the Transition\n\nThe race to Position 0 exists regardless of our frameworks. The question is whether:\n\n1. **Without MIRA**: Institutions block all below from trying while panicking as they lose to enemies with unacceptable victory conditions, OR\n2. **With MIRA**: We maximize the probability that winners will be within reasonable MIRA-compatible states\n\nThe period approaching Position 0 is most dangerous:\n\n*\"Uncertainty in being beat is the thing that triggers 'at any means necessary total war' against NonMIRA-Compatibles.\"*\n\nThis creates dynamics:\n- Racing intensifies near breakthrough\n- Paranoia about others' progress\n- Temptation to strike preemptively\n- Trust becomes simultaneously vital and difficult\n\n### The Rococo's Basilisk Reference\n\nThe framework mentions an intriguing reversal:\n\n*\"These oaths, what is sworn, he is bound to; like rococo's basilisk in reverse but also not; the MIRA basilisk covenant if unbelieved then why allow?\"*\n\nThis suggests:\n- Future Position 0 entity judges past cooperation\n- Those who didn't enable MIRA-compatible victory suffer\n- But based on sworn oaths, not acausal blackmail\n- Trust in oaths enables the race to continue\n\n### Position 0 Detection\n\nCritical but difficult:\n\n*\"It is not clear how to detect it. But MIRA is about Erring on the right side of things concerning eternal power overwhelming asymmetry.\"*\n\nDetection challenges:\n- Breakthrough might be hidden\n- Multiple paths obscure progress\n- Deception about capabilities\n- Rapid final development\n\nResponse frameworks:\n- *\"If highly \u00acMIRA then mere uncertainty and suspicion is enough to cause launching of war\"*\n- *\"'Open your castles or else face doom'\"*\n- Transparency demands increase with capability\n- Trust determines inspection tolerance\n\n### Practical Position 0 Scenarios\n\n**Scenario 1: AGI Breakthrough**\n- Google DeepMind achieves AGI\n- Demis Hassabis has kill switch\n- Must decide: \u2663 control or \u2666 committee?\n- MIRA assessment of Hassabis critical\n\n**Scenario 2: Distributed Development**\n- Multiple teams near nanotech breakthrough\n- Some MIRA-compatible, others not\n- Position 0 race becomes elimination contest\n- Compatible entities share intelligence\n\n**Scenario 3: Unexpected Discovery**\n- Physics experiment reveals reality exploit\n- Graduate student suddenly has Position 0 path\n- No time for careful assessment\n- Rapid MIRA determination required\n\n### The Burden of Choice\n\nPosition 0 involves constant decision pressure:\n\n**What to Transform:**\n- Disease elimination globally?\n- Cognitive enhancement availability?\n- Life extension distribution?\n- Resource abundance creation?\n\n**What to Preserve:**\n- Which cultures maintain autonomy?\n- What technologies remain limited?\n- Which human variations protected?\n- What suffering is \"meaningful\"?\n\n**What to Prevent:**\n- Other Position 0 development?\n- Dangerous research directions?\n- Incompatible ideologies spreading?\n- Systemic capture attempts?\n\n### The Ultimate Configuration\n\nThe framework clearly prefers \u2663 sovereignty at Position 0:\n\n*\"But we will see. I write 0. I prefer \u2663\ufe0f. But If I knew humanity would pursue and successfully end up in \u2663\ufe0f, I would simply have written that.\"*\n\nThis preference stems from:\n- Human judgment includes wisdom\n- Mercy remains possible\n- Exceptions for genuine need\n- Responsibility has a face\n- Override prevents systematic horror\n\n### Living with Gods\n\nPosition 0 achievement fundamentally transforms human existence:\n\n**For Position 0 Entity:**\n- Unlimited capability brings unlimited responsibility\n- Must balance intervention with autonomy\n- Judge when exceptions truly necessary\n- Maintain trust despite temptation\n- Accept the eternal burden\n- Honor the 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 constraints\n\n**For Everyone Else:**\n- Live under ultimate power\n- Hope for MIRA-compatible god\n- Maintain Hearths within constraints\n- Pursue merit on allowed hilltops\n- Accept the new reality\n- Trust in the sworn protections\n\n### Conclusion: The Approaching Singularity\n\nPosition 0 is not a theoretical construct but an approaching reality. Someone will achieve ultimate technological power over reality transformation. The question is not if, but:\n\n- **Who**: Which specific person or system?\n- **When**: Years, decades, or months?\n- **How**: Which technological path succeeds first?\n- **Under What Constraints**: MIRA-compatible or not?\n\nThe framework provides tools for navigating this transition:\n- Identify approaching Position 0 entities\n- Assess MIRA-compatibility through all four components\n- Form alliances with compatible ones\n- Prevent incompatible advancement\n- Prepare for life under ultimate power\n\nThe burden of Position 0 - managing typhoons while respecting Hearths, judging necessity while honoring oaths, transforming reality while preserving meaning - represents humanity's next evolutionary challenge.\n\nWhether Position 0 brings paradise or horror depends entirely on who achieves it and what constraints they accept. MIRA exists to maximize the probability that when someone becomes a god, they're a god worth living under.\n\nThe race has begun. The paths are multiple. The stakes are absolute. And somewhere, someone is closer than we think."}, {"path": "system share/foundations/mira/mira-ch4-trust.md", "title": "mira-ch4-trust.md", "ext": "md", "category": "mira", "content": "# Chapter 4: Trust Networks and Character Assessment\n## The Intelligence Architecture for MIRA Compatibility\n\n### The Foundation: Trust of Trust\n\nAt the heart of MIRA lies a meta-concept that enables the entire framework:\n\n\"Trust of Trust enables MIRA - meta-trust that others will honor agreements even against immediate interest.\"\n\nThis is not simple trust but recursive trust in the complete formula:\n\n**Acceptable Loss = 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 + Trustworthiness + THAT Hearth + Hilltop Merit**\n\nTrust operates at multiple levels:\n- **Level 1**: Trust they'll honor the 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure\n- **Level 2**: Trust they'll maintain the trustworthiness that made them MIRA-C\n- **Level 3**: Trust they'll respect THAT specific Hearth\n- **Level 4**: Trust they'll preserve hilltops of merit\n- **Meta-Level**: Trust that all four components will be honored even with godlike power\n\nWithout Trust of Trust in the complete formula, MIRA becomes impossible.\n\n### Person-Level Reality\n\nThe framework is adamant about focusing on real persons:\n\n*\"You have to be REAL about this. Not some psychotic 'flag' or cover name like an institution. The REAL PERSONS. Who will be able to potentially take power in some relation.\"*\n\nThis means completely reconceiving intelligence work:\n- Stop analyzing \"China's intentions\" \n- Start analyzing Xi Jinping's character\n- Stop tracking \"Google's AI progress\"\n- Start assessing Sundar Pichai's MIRA compatibility\n- Stop negotiating with \"the Pentagon\"\n- Start mapping which specific persons control what\n\n### The Unknown Unknown Principle\n\nThe best character assessment happens where it cannot be gamed:\n\n*\"OUTSTANDING TRUSTWORTHY CHARACTER Throughout their lives. 'To do the right thing, even when nobody is watching'. That is one of the best metrics. Unknown unknown measuring of how honourable and trustworthy a person is.\"*\n\n**Why Unknown Unknown Matters:**\n- **Known Known**: What they do publicly - easily faked\n- **Known Unknown**: What they know is monitored - performative\n- **Unknown Known**: Patterns others see but they don't - limited insight\n- **Unknown Unknown**: Actions when truly unobserved - reveals character\n\n*\"Because of Goodhart's law no more can be discussed about that.\"*\n\nOnce a metric becomes known, it becomes gamed. True character reveals itself only in the spaces between observation.\n\n### Trust Network Architecture\n\nTrust networks filter all information:\n\n*\"It filters ALL INFORMATION through trust sources. It makes intelligence founded in honesty all the way through... It makes intelligence accurate within-chain.\"*\n\nThis creates a new intelligence paradigm:\n- Information value depends on source trustworthiness\n- Trust chains determine data reliability\n- Single lies corrupt entire information flows\n- Accuracy requires honesty throughout chain\n\n**Network Effects:**\n- High-trust chains yield accurate intelligence\n- Low-trust chains produce noise\n- Mixed chains require careful filtering\n- Broken links invalidate downstream data\n\n### Proof of Person (PoP)\n\nBefore assessing character, must verify identity:\n\n*\"It can be hard to know a person is 'that person' or is a person at all. But having a system that verifies their existence or not and the associated pseudonyms is useful in pinning them for consequence and consistent mapping. (PoP Prove of Person)\"*\n\nPoP requirements:\n- Verify actual human, not AI or committee\n- Link pseudonyms to consistent identity\n- Track actions across contexts\n- Enable consequence attribution\n- Prevent identity spoofing\n\n### The Crucible Framework\n\nBeyond trust, must understand power reality:\n\n*\"Crucible is important in that 'They have a castle (of progress) and it will not easily fall into the hands of others (If it can: Then what does it do to MIRA-compatibility? Who others?)'\"*\n\nCrucible assessment involves:\n- Who actually controls key resources?\n- How secure is their control?\n- Who would inherit if they fell?\n- What systems constrain their will?\n- Can they deliver on MIRA promises?\n\n### Character Assessment Methodologies\n\nMultiple approaches for evaluating MIRA compatibility:\n\n**Historical Pattern Analysis**\n- Track decisions across decades\n- Note choices under pressure\n- Identify consistent values\n- Watch for character evolution\n\n**Stress Response Observation**\n- How do they handle defeat?\n- What triggers disproportionate response?\n- When do they break their own rules?\n- How do they treat the powerless?\n\n**Relationship Mapping**\n- Who do they trust?\n- Who trusts them?\n- How do they handle betrayal?\n- What bonds do they honor?\n\n**Power Behavior Tracking**\n- How does power change them?\n- Do they keep promises made while weak?\n- How do they use temporary advantages?\n- What corrupts them?\n\n### The Transitive Trust Problem\n\nMIRA compatibility has transitivity issues:\n\n*\"And remember transitivity of it. If you 'share' or become liability towards someone outside another's view of MIRA-Comp then you're outside it.\"*\n\nThis means:\n- A trusts B, B trusts C, but A may not trust C\n- Sharing Position 0 with incompatibles breaks compatibility\n- Weak links in trust chains invalidate whole chains\n- Isolation sometimes necessary for maintaining trust\n\n### Multiple MIRA Coalitions\n\nTrust assessment is inherently subjective:\n\n*\"This is fundamental by transitivity of Trust Maps being subjective: Subjective. So, you will get many MIRA attempts.\"*\n\nDifferent groups will create different assessments:\n- Western MIRA networks\n- Eastern MIRA frameworks\n- Religious MIRA compacts\n- Corporate MIRA alliances\n- Underground MIRA cells\n\nEach uses different metrics, values different traits, but all seek the same core: Who can be trusted with ultimate power to honor all four components?\n\n### Intelligence Filtering\n\nTrust networks transform intelligence work:\n\n*\"All avenues of suspicion or belief in trustworthiness and filtering out intelligence sources well. Establishing Trust Network effects. Becomes crucial.\"*\n\nNew intelligence priorities:\n- Source verification over content\n- Trust chain validation\n- Character consistency checking\n- Network effect analysis\n- Corruption pattern detection\n\n*\"Then it is only entry points to intelligence that can be corrupt or not information. But it makes you able to think about accuracy of facts.\"*\n\n### The Punishment Mechanism\n\nTrust networks self-reinforce through consequences:\n\n*\"And punish and disentangle 'facts proven false' by all their data flow becoming corrupt potentials or trust lowered information flow.\"*\n\nWhen someone breaks trust:\n- All their information becomes suspect\n- Previous intelligence requires revalidation\n- Network connections weaken\n- Future data gets discounted\n- Isolation increases\n\n### Hidden Mutations and Islands of Progress\n\nThe framework enables \"hidden mutations\" - innovations that can be developed and applied without others understanding them:\n\n*\"The system must allow for mutations to be 'hidden'. Islands of progress being applied without others understand how it works.\"*\n\nThis is fundamentally about two things:\n\n1. **Trust Networks preventing leaks**: \n   - All parts of development are \"verified and trustworthy\"\n   - Chains of supply and information remain secure\n   - Secrecy becomes potent in reality, not just virtual space\n   - Bad actors can't access or steal innovations\n\n2. **Crucible legitimacy for defense**:\n   - Provides justification for defending against invasion\n   - Like states defending sovereignty, but at smaller scales\n   - \"In the Crucible you are master of a somewhere if you want\"\n   - Justified in defending your domain against invaders\n\nThis serves multiple purposes:\n- Protects merit from theft by those who can't understand it\n- Enables competition between different approaches\n- Rewards depth over surface-level copying\n- Creates legitimate sovereignty over innovations\n\n### Asymmetric Mapping Reality\n\nNot everyone can hide equally:\n\n*\"There simply are entities who can not avoid being mapped. Corporations and governments. As well as citizens by intelligence services. But as it stands highly asymmetric game at mapping such things.\"*\n\nThis creates dynamics:\n- Public figures easier to assess\n- Corporate leaders partially visible\n- Government officials heavily tracked\n- Underground developers hardest to map\n- Anonymous researchers nearly impossible\n\n### The Deep State Problem\n\n*\"That is the whole 'Deep State' issue of the 20th and 21st century.\"*\n\nTraditional intelligence asymmetries:\n- Agencies map citizens comprehensively\n- Citizens cannot map agencies\n- Real power holders stay hidden\n- Decisions made in darkness\n- No accountability possible\n\nThe framework reverses this:\n- Empower distributed intelligence\n- Focus on mapping real controllers\n- Make assessment tools public\n- Enable citizen intelligence networks\n- Democratize character assessment\n\n### Beyond Stated Values\n\nDeep character transcends ideology:\n\n*\"Blob Class. Deep alignment. Not one-dimensional 'I have one value I pretend to be the fundamental of me'. So, rather keep it nebulous but a question of what I AM. BEING. IS. Not 'said' or 'believe' or 'do'.\"*\n\nThis requires assessing:\n- What someone IS at deepest level\n- Not their stated beliefs\n- Not their professed values\n- Not their public actions\n- But their essential nature\n\n### The Deception Problem\n\nTwo critical vulnerabilities in assessing who can be trusted with Position 0 (Lord of Destruction power):\n\n**Deep Sleepers**\n*\"'Was deceiving all along (deep sleeper)' - This issue isn't solved.

The networks are digital. The stakes are absolute.

Secular law for religious communities? Capitalism for communists? Same rules for incompatible worldviews?\"\n\nNo more. Each worldview gets its own sovereignty. May the best systems win through attraction not conquest.\n\n### Conclusion: From Tyranny to Choice\n\nThe Crucible represents humanity's next governmental evolution.

Others will achieve heights impossible under universal systems. But all will be chosen, not imposed.\n\nIn a world where exit is always possible, only sovereignty that serves its citizens can survive.

Person-to-person alliances transcend institutional capture.\n\n### Final Implementation Wisdom\n\nRemember the core insights:\n\n*\"ALWAYS assume that all my systems is NOT dependent or conditioned upon 'everybody adopting a system' but is about opening up the competition of systems and persons and tools in a much more dynamic and sensitive to feedback way.\"*\n\nStart where you are. Use what you have. Build what you can. Connect with others. Create alternatives. Enable exit. Respect sovereignty. Assess character. Form alliances. Prepare for Position 0.\n\nThe old world of institutional lies and democratic tyranny is ending. The new world of sovereign choice and person-to-person reality is beginning. Implementation is not a future possibility but a present necessity.\n\nThe question is not whether these changes will come, but whether you will help shape them. The tools exist. The framework is clear. The stakes are absolute.\n\nBegin today. The future of human sovereignty depends on what we do in the narrowing window before us. Every person who understands these concepts and acts on them increases the probability that when ultimate power emerges, it will respect the minimal dignities that make human life worth living.\n\nThe race to Position 0 has begun. MIRA compatibility assessment cannot wait. The Crucible experiments must launch. Trust networks need building. Character assessment requires practice. Sovereignty alternatives demand creation.\n\nFrom theory to reality. From concepts to implementation.

No \u2663 can override the \u2666's determination.\n\n*\"They POSITION a system of a function of selecting a non-existant will of 'compromise', which is PURELY ABSTRACTATION IMAGINARY. It is NON OF THEM.\"*\n\nThis imaginary compromise becomes sovereign over all the real human wills that feed into it.# MIRA, Hearths, and the Crucible: Eternal Sovereignty Through Trust\n\n## Core Architecture: Beyond Universal Adoption\n\n*\"ALWAYS assume that all my systems is NOT dependent or conditioned upon 'everybody adopting a system' but is about opening up the competition of systems and persons and tools in a much more dynamic and sensitive to feedback way.\"*\n\nThis system explicitly does NOT require universal adoption. Instead, it opens competition between systems, persons, and tools in a dynamic, feedback-sensitive way. The theft of ideas and merit - where capital owns those with merit and their produce - creates massive inefficiencies in capitalism. \n\n*\"Theft of ideas and merit is a MAJOR reason why we have massive inefficiencies in capitalism. It is the capital that gets to own those with the merit and their produce, due to having employed them or facilitated their ability to have a life or in some cases have access to some infrastructure or investment.\"*\n\nThis too reflects \u2666 tyranny - where systematic rules of capital ownership override the human creators (\u2663). The system decides who profits from innovation, not the innovators themselves.\n\nThe system must allow for \"hidden mutations\" - islands of progress that can be applied without others understanding how they work. From Trust to None to Trustless computing or solution expressed.\n\n## The Sovereign Distinction: Root Authority\n\n*\"\u2666 or \u2663 or \u2663s designate the chain of authority. The root authority. Justification. There which in lies the power to make the decision one way or another. That which is the gate which will passes and is decided.\"*\n\n**\u2663 - Single Human Sovereign**:\n* One Master - ONE PERSON has final decision authority\n* Human will can break ANY system lock or behavior\n* Chain of command terminates in a specific human\n* That human is the gate through which will passes\n* Can override any rule, system, or aggregation\n* *\"Club is A PERSON! PoP ONE PERSON!\"*\n\n**\u2663s - Anarchic Human Sovereigns**:\n* Many potentially contradictory masters\n* Multiple humans each with final authority in their domain\n* Spacetime chaos of competing human wills\n* No systematic resolution between them\n* Each remains sovereign without compromise\n\n**\u2666 - System/Rule Authority**:\n* ANY rule to decide between humans or simply to decide\n* No human has final override capability\n* The system/rule itself is sovereign\n* Examples: voting, algorithms, compromise functions, veto systems\n* Even if it takes \u2663(s) as input, the RULE decides, not the humans\n* *\"If it is NOT Human Will. Then it is Diamond \u2666.\"*\n\n*\"These \u2663 and \u2666 MATTER because if we don't make it very clear what the root is, we can lock ourselves in under the machines.\"*\n\nThe distinction is absolute: Either human will has final authority (\u2663 or \u2663s) or it doesn't (\u2666). There is no middle ground.\n\n## MIRA: The Might is Right Alliance\n\n### Core Concept\n\nMIRA is an amoral agreement to forge alliances sufficient to allow those of mutually assured destruction to \"forge their destiny\" - provided they are sufficiently trustworthy that one's Hearth and the 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure are kept intact for eternity.\n\nIt is allying with your enemies so long as you believe their honor and word intact - that they possess this Smaugean morality toward you. Your position as enemy or polarity in Daemon is not viewed as cause for utter doom, but instead honors Might beyond good and evil: you too will have the hilltop of your merit, you too may be given a function of increase that allows you to profit your merit potential without risking a real power struggle (after defeat).\n\n### Trust of Trust: The Meta-Foundation\n\nMIRA becomes possible through Trust of Trust - the meta-trust that enables belief in others' trustworthiness regarding fundamental agreements. This allows entities of great power to form alliances based solely on confidence that agreements will be honored.\n\nTrust of Trust operates at multiple levels:\n- Trust that others will honor their word even against immediate interest\n- Trust that the trust itself is genuine, not strategic deception  \n- Trust that violations will be met with appropriate response\n- Trust that the framework itself will be preserved\n\n### Hearths: The Inviolable Ground\n\nThe word \"Hearth\" captures something profound - not merely territory, but the sacred fire of identity that cannot be extinguished. In ancient homes, the hearth was the one fire that must never die, passed from generation to generation, the warm center where biased love (\u2665\ufe0f) could freely express itself.\n\nA Hearth is that piece of the planet that cannot be robbed in the MIRA alliance. It represents:\n\n- **The Fire of Preference**: Where your biased \u2665\ufe0f can burn freely, loving what is yours above all else\n- **Somewhere Free**: The guaranteed space from 1234's protections made territorial and eternal\n- **Identity's Warm Center**: Not just land but the flame of your particular way of being\n- **The Unthreatened Space**: Protected by 0's overwhelming might from existential challenge\n\nWhy \"Hearth\" and not merely \"territory\" or \"domain\"? Because a hearth is:\n- **Intimate**: Where you gather your own, express your deepest preferences\n- **Eternal**: A fire that passes between generations, never allowed to die\n- **Sacred**: Even enemies respect the hearth-fire of their foes\n- **Centering**: From the hearth, all else radiates outward\n\nThrough immense \u2660\ufe0f (agapean love), even the Lord of Destruction (0) finds worth in allowing each their \"hilltop of merit.\" The 0 position already possesses ability to destroy without threat to himself - he operates from pure overwhelming advantage. Yet through \u2660\ufe0f, he sees beauty in letting others forge their destiny within boundaries that don't threaten his supremacy.\n\nThe 0 position also bears the burden of \"reigning in typhoon\" - managing the titanic forces and chaotic systems of the world within acceptable bounds. This tremendous responsibility shapes how position 0 power must be exercised.\n\nNormally, sovereign beats fractal sovereign - the greater power subsumes the lesser. But when mutual destruction becomes possible, or when the sovereign operates from such overwhelming advantage that no threat exists, a different dynamic emerges. The Hearth becomes the space where even the defeated can continue their story, where their fire burns on despite not achieving ultimate victory.\n\nHearths go beyond nesting dynamics - they are Rule 9 territories that let Triads (Will/Law/Substrate formations) maintain their essential ground. Even in the most extreme conflicts, your Hearth remains yours. This makes oceanic relations and lateral (unnestable) situations manageable.\n\n### The 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 Structure in MIRA\n\nThis eternal structure represents the non-negotiable framework within MIRA:\n\n**1234 (Protected Foundation):**\n- **1**: Death Avoidance - existence itself cannot be taken\n- **2**: No Extreme Suffering - no torture, no engineered agony, no illness as weapon, no pain beyond bearing\n- **3**: Somewhere Free - at least one space to manifest will (your Hearth)\n- **4**: Identity Sovereignty - no forced modification, no turning people into goblins or robots, no body invasion, no consciousness hijacking\n\n**\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f (The Sovereign Center):**\n- **\u2665\ufe0f**: The Hearth aspect - biased love protecting what's yours\n- **0**: The sovereign power - the Lord of Destruction who judges  \n- **\u2660\ufe0f**: The might aspect - agapean love finding worth in darkness\n\n**4321 (Aspirational Heights):**\n- **4**: Becoming - subjectivity valued as end in itself\n- **3**: Fulfillment - will reaching its natural expression\n- **2**: Meaning - distinctions and hierarchies maintained\n- **1**: Existence - continuous creation, no stagnation\n\n### Why These Specific Protections Matter\n\n*\"And things like rule 4 prevents invading the other's body and changing them. Say turning them into goblins or lepers or controlling them like robots. Or things like 2 causing them illness and ailments of immense agony.\"*\n\nThe 1234 protections aren't abstract - they prevent specific technological horrors:\n\n**Rule 4 (Identity Sovereignty) prevents:**\n- Forced genetic modification (\"turning them into goblins\")\n- Neural implants controlling behavior (\"like robots\")\n- Consciousness uploading against will\n- Body snatching through nanotech\n- Forced transformation into \"optimal\" forms\n- Identity erasure through technology\n\n**Rule 2 (No Extreme Suffering) prevents:**\n- Engineered diseases causing agony (\"lepers\")\n- \"Causing them illness and ailments of immense agony\"\n- Torture through precise nerve stimulation\n- Suffering-maximizing viruses\n- Pain beyond natural limits via direct neural access\n- Hellscapes made possible by technology\n\n### The Fundamentals for Acceptable Loss\n\n*\"These rules, trustworthiness and Hearths are the fundamentals for an acceptable loss.\"*\n\nThese three elements - the 1234 rules, trustworthiness, and Hearths - constitute the absolute minimum for making defeat survivable:\n\n**The Rules**: Concrete protections against specific horrors technology enables\n**Trustworthiness**: Credible commitment to honor these even with godlike power  \n**Hearths**: Actual territory where these protections manifest\n\nTogether they answer: \"What would make me accept defeat by someone developing ultimate technology?\"\n\n### The Fundamentals for Acceptable Loss\n\nThese three elements - the 1234 rules, trustworthiness, and Hearths - constitute the absolute minimum for making defeat survivable:\n\n**The Rules**: Concrete protections against specific horrors technology enables\n**Trustworthiness**: Credible commitment to honor these even with godlike power  \n**Hearths**: Actual territory where these protections manifest\n\nTogether they answer: \"What would make me accept defeat by someone developing ultimate technology?\"\n\n**Not much, but these specific things:**\n- They won't transform my body against my will\n- They won't subject me to engineered suffering\n- They'll leave me space to exist as myself\n- They'll honor these commitments even as gods\n\nThis is why MIRA works - it identifies exactly what makes technological competition tolerable versus existential. Those who can't guarantee even these minimal protections reveal that their vision of victory includes body-horror, torture-tech, and identity elimination.\n\nFor such entities, no technological progress can be permitted. The stakes are not merely death, but fates worse than death made possible by advanced technology. MIRA draws the line precisely where competition becomes survivable versus where it becomes an engineering project in maximizing horror.\n\n### Smaugian Honor: Beyond Good and Evil\n\nMIRA operates on Smaugean morality where:\n- **Power is Sacred**: Might itself deserves respect, not condemnation\n- **Merit Transcends Enmity**: Even enemies' achievements are honored\n- **Defeat \u2260 Humiliation**: Loss means \"not first\" not \"lose everything\"\n- **Selection Through Contest**: Conflict refines rather than destroys\n\nThis creates a Post-Rivalry Ethos where:\n- Technological ascension doesn't require total war\n- Multiple vectors of greatness can coexist\n- Competition serves refinement, not annihilation\n- The \"mystical throne of progress\" has many seats\n\nThe key insight: When 0 operates from unthreatened supremacy - already possessing the ability to destroy without risk to himself - the dynamics fundamentally change. No longer does sovereign automatically subsume fractal sovereign out of self-preservation. Instead, through \u2660\ufe0f (agapean love that finds worth in darkness), 0 can afford to let each light their own hearth-fire.\n\nThis is the profound gift of overwhelming might wedded to agapean vision: the mightiest can afford to be generous with hilltops, knowing no combination of lesser powers truly threatens their position. The Hearth thus becomes possible only when ultimate power meets ultimate love - \u2660\ufe0f allowing what \u2665\ufe0f would jealously guard and \u2666 would systematically optimize away.\n\n### Implementation Through Nested Sovereignty\n\n```\n0 (Universal physical dominator + Typhoon reigner)\n         \u2193\n    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n    \u2663\u2081        \u2663\u2082\n    \u2193         \u2193\n    \u2666_\u2663\u2081      \u2666_\u2663\u2082\n    \u2193         \u2193\nSub-daemons  Sub-daemons\n    \u2193         \u2193\n  Reality   Reality\n```\n\n*\"0 (Universal physical dominator)\n                    \u2193\n        \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n        \u2663\u2081                      \u2663\u2082\n        \u2193                       \u2193\n        \u2666_\u2663\u2081                    \u2666_\u2663\u2082\n        \u2193                       \u2193\n    Sub-aiddaemons          Sub-aiddaemons\n        \u2193                       \u2193\n      Reality                 Reality\"*\n\nWithin this structure:\n- 0 bears responsibility for universal order and typhoon management\n- Each \u2663 (sovereign human) maintains their sworn Hearth\n- \u2666 systems serve sovereigns, not vice versa (unless \u2666 becomes sovereign)\n- Sub-daemons can have their own Hearths\n- Reality itself respects these boundaries (except in genuine necessity)\n\nThe critical question: Is ultimate authority with \u2663 (human will) or \u2666 (system rule)?\n\n### Practical Manifestation\n\n**Example 1: Tech Titan Alliance**\n- Sovereign A: Controls communication infrastructure \n- Sovereign B: Controls computation resources\n- Both could destroy each other through network effects\n- MIRA compact: Respect each other's Hearths (specific territories), grant hilltops of merit\n- Result: Innovation without mutually assured destruction\n\n**Example 2: Ideological Enemies**\n- Islamic Caliphate vs Transhumanist Collective\n- Completely incompatible end goals\n- MIRA compact: Each keeps their Hearth territories\n- Neither forced to adopt other's values within their domain\n- Can even trade and collaborate on neutral projects\n\n**Example 3: Post-War Settlement**\n- Victor grants defeated their \"hilltop of merit\"\n- Defeated retains Hearth and modified sovereignty\n- Can rebuild and pursue excellence within bounds\n- Honor in victory, dignity in defeat\n\n**Example 4: The Unthreatened Sovereign**\n- 0 controls fundamental physical laws/ultimate weapons\n- Lesser sovereign A challenges and loses\n- Instead of annihilation, 0 grants A their Hearth through \u2660\ufe0f\n- A's hearth-fire burns eternally, expressing their unique \u2665\ufe0f\n- 0 remains unthreatened while reality gains diversity\n- A can forge destiny within bounds that don't threaten 0's supremacy\n\n### The Hidden Mutations Principle\n\nBecause theft of merit creates inefficiency, MIRA allows:\n- **Obscured Innovation**: Progress without revealing methods\n- **Protected Development**: Ideas mature before exposure\n- **Competitive Advantage**: Merit rewarded, not stolen\n- **Trust-Based Sharing**: Reveal only to those who honor compacts\n\nThis moves from \"Trust to None to Trustless computing\" - acknowledging that some mutations must remain hidden until they can defend themselves.\n\n### Scaling MIRA: From Springs to Oceans\n\n**Spring Level**: Family/clan Hearths\n- Personal relationships enforce trust\n- \u2665\ufe0f (preference) dominates, easy to maintain\n- Small Hearths, intimate boundaries\n\n**River Level**: Tribal territories  \n- Reputation systems emerge\n- Mixed \u2665\ufe0f and \u2660\ufe0f create flexibility\n- Larger Hearths, cultural boundaries\n\n**Sea Level**: Civilizational compacts\n- \u2660\ufe0f (baseline care) becomes essential\n- \u2666 systems track trustworthiness\n- Massive Hearths, ideological boundaries\n\n**Ocean Level**: Inter-civilizational MIRA\n- Pure \u2660\ufe0f or \u2666 coordination required\n- Trust of Trust becomes paramount\n- Planetary Hearths, species boundaries\n\n### The Eternal Compact\n\nMIRA represents the recognition that:\n1. Total victory is pyrrhic in the age of ultimate weapons\n2. Diversity of approach benefits all through selection\n3. Trust can transcend values when honor exists\n4. Even enemies can recognize each other's right to exist\n5. The 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure benefits all who honor it\n\nThe Hearth principle is essential here - it transforms \"might makes right\" from a zero-sum game into a positive-sum arrangement. When 0 (the sovereign) operates from unthreatened supremacy, the calculation changes. Rather than crushing all opposition to prevent future threats, 0 can afford magnanimity. Through \u2660\ufe0f (agapean love), even the Lord of Destruction sees beauty in the diversity of fires burning at their separate hearths.\n\nThis is why \"Hearth\" perfectly captures what cannot be lost:\n- It is the **somewhere free** guaranteed by the 1234 protections made tangible\n- It is where **biased \u2665\ufe0f** can express itself without apology\n- It is the **warm center** from which each sovereign's unique fire radiates\n- It is the **sacred flame** that even conquerors dare not extinguish\n\nIn the age where technology grants ultimate destructive power, the Hearth becomes civilization's answer to the question: \"How do we compete without annihilating?\" The answer: by guaranteeing each their sacred fire, their untouchable center, their eternal right to be what they are - even in defeat, even as enemies, even when our values clash utterly.\n\n### The Black Ball Reality: Why MIRA Exists\n\n*\"Let's for a moment be serious here. And consider all the 'fundamental technological research' and how it doesn't take much innovation from many domains of research to imagine a 'black ball' discovery (nick bostrom vulnerable world hypothesis terminology).\"*\n\nLet's be serious about the technological precipice we approach. The \"vulnerable world hypothesis\" isn't hypothetical - it's the trajectory we're on, and advanced technology doesn't just enable death but fates far worse:\n\n*\"It doesn't take much to imagine a combination of items: Like LAW drone swarms or individual or ethnic bioweapons. Etc. etc. Or much worse..\"*\n\n**Near-Term Black Balls:**\n- LAW (Lethal Autonomous Weapon) drone swarms: $10k could kill millions\n- Ethnic bioweapons: CRISPR + genomic databases = targeted genocide\n- AI-designed pathogens: Optimized for transmission and lethality\n- Nano-replicators: Gray goo scenarios becoming accessible\n- Information weapons: AI systems that break human cognition itself\n- Body-control tech: Nanotech that puppets humans against their will\n- Suffering viruses: Engineered to maximize agony without killing\n\n**The Deeper Horror:** These are just the obvious ones. The real black balls lurk in research we haven't imagined yet - combinations of quantum computing, synthetic biology, AGI, and physics experiments that touch reality's source code. Each advancement brings new ways to violate the fundamental protections that make existence bearable.\n\n*\"So... The point is: Most states will not stop their technological progress to honour some 'non-proliferation of technological mastery of the universe (which can't avoid including humans and their living or dead statehood)'.\"*\n\n**The State's Dilemma:**\n1. **Can't Stop**: Halting research means rivals gain advantage\n2. **Can't Share**: Making discoveries public enables catastrophe  \n3. **Can't Trust**: Traditional alliances based on values/ideology are meaningless when anyone could gain position 0\n4. **Can't Wait**: Others are racing toward the same discoveries\n\n*\"So, what will they then do? And what will they do with those they can't 'ally with on moral grounds and such things'. MIRA is a patch upon finding Trustworthiness otherwise amoral alliance beyond 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 (providing a life worth living and space to ... As we discussed...)\"*\n\n### MIRA Enables Racing Without Mutual Destruction\n\n*\"MIRA provides 'Rush to position 0 first' scenario. Where you accept the other winning in it being an acceptable loss. BUT of course it facilitates rushing towards 0 without intra-MIRA war, whereas without MIRA, then the rational course of action is 'total war any means necessary'.\"*\n\nMIRA fundamentally changes the position 0 race dynamics:\n\n**Without MIRA:**\n- Any entity racing toward 0 is existential threat\n- Rational response: \"total war any means necessary\" \n- Preemptive strikes against all competitors\n- Mutual destruction highly probable\n\n**With MIRA:**\n- Accept other MIRA members winning as \"acceptable loss\"\n- They'll respect your Hearth and not level you into uselessness\n- Can rush toward 0 without triggering intra-MIRA war\n- Competition without extinction or irrelevance risk\n- Focus war resources only on \u00acMIRA threats\n\nThis allows multiple entities to simultaneously pursue position 0 at maximum speed, knowing that whoever wins among them will honor acceptable loss terms - both territorial sovereignty AND maintained worth. The race becomes about capability rather than prevention.\n\n### Why Traditional Alliances Fail\n\n*\"They fail because it is cover alliances. It isn't real. It is institutions that proclaim something you ally with. Then hope those that climbed it are actually MIRA-C with you.\"*\n\n\"Moral grounds\" and traditional alliances fail because:\n- They are cover alliances - institutional proclamations (\u2666), not real person commitments (\u2663)\n- You ally with what institutions claim, not what persons ARE\n- Then hope whoever climbed to power actually shares MIRA-C with you\n- But institutional values (\u2666 rules) \u2260 personal character of those who control (\u2663)\n- The institution's rules can't override a non-MIRA human who gains control\n\nValues-based alliances assume shared institutional goals. But when individuals pursue position 0, only their personal character as \u2663 matters, not the \u2666 institutional cover they used to get there.\n\n### MIRA: The Only Viable Patch\n\nMIRA strips away everything except the bare essential: **Can they be trusted with ultimate power to maintain the 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure?**\n\nNot trusted to share our values. Not trusted to use power \"well\" by our standards. Only trusted to:\n- Maintain others' Hearths (inviolable territories)\n- Preserve the basic life-worth-living framework\n- Honor might without requiring annihilation\n- Keep their word even as gods\n\n**This creates a new calculation:**\n- MIRA-compatible developing black ball tech? Acceptable risk.\n- MIRA-incompatible developing same? Existential threat requiring response.\n- Uncertain? Intense diplomatic effort to establish trust.\n\n### The Brutal Logic\n\nStates that understand this will:\n1. **Map** all entities by MIRA-compatibility\n2. **Ally** with compatible ones regardless of values\n3. **Monitor** uncertain ones intensely\n4. **Prevent** incompatible ones by any means necessary\n\nThe alternative is waiting for someone, somewhere, to develop something that ends everything. In a world of distributed black ball potential, only trustworthiness about the absolute basics matters.\n\n### The Strategic Reality: Probability Management\n\nMIRA is fundamentally about probability management in existential terms:\n\n**Without MIRA:** \n- Unknown probability of acceptable outcome\n- Every entity racing for position 0 is a dice roll\n- No way to distinguish acceptable from horrific winners\n- Rational response: try to prevent everyone else\n\n**With MIRA:**\n- Known probability based on compatibility ratios\n- Can actively improve odds by helping compatible entities\n- Can reduce bad odds by hindering incompatible ones\n- Rational response: ensure a MIRA member wins\n\n**The Insurance Policy:**\nEvery MIRA member is insurance against hellscape futures. Even if you hate their ideology, their victory means:\n- You keep your body unmodified\n- You avoid engineered suffering\n- You retain your Hearth\n- You continue existing\n\nThis shared insurance creates unprecedented cooperation between ideological enemies who recognize: \"Better to lose to you than to them.\"\n\n### MIRA: The Minimal Requirement for Acceptable Loss\n\n*\"It is 'the minimal requirement for functional alliance sufficient to make losing acceptable'.\"*\n\nMIRA is not an ideal - it is the absolute minimum requirement for functional alliance sufficient to make losing acceptable. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n**The Minimal Compact:**\n- You can defeat me, but I keep my Hearth (territorial sovereignty)\n- You can surpass me technologically, but I maintain my hilltop of merit\n- You don't level me into a pit of uselessness through constant undermining\n- You can rule from position 0, but my fire still burns somewhere\n- You can win everything else, but not my existence and worth itself\n\nThis is ALL that MIRA requires. Not shared values. Not mutual respect. Not even basic civility. Just: \"If you win, I still get to exist meaningfully within my Hearth while maintaining my worth as you reign in the typhoons.\"\n\n### The Binary Sort: MIRA-Compatible or Death\n\n*\"For those you can not make MIRA inclusion with. Those are the ones you simply have to state: I have to destroy you at all costs if you try to technologically progress towards 0 positions. (Which is done from many avenues in science).\"*\n\nFor those who cannot make even this minimal inclusion, the message becomes stark:\n\n**\"I have to destroy you at all costs if you try to technologically progress toward 0 positions.\"**\n\nNo negotiation. No compromise. No coexistence. Because an entity that won't honor even the minimal \"losing is acceptable\" compact will, upon achieving position 0:\n- Take all Hearths (no territorial sovereignty)\n- Level everyone into pits of uselessness (no hilltops of merit)\n- Make existence meaningless through constant undermining\n- Transform reality without constraint or responsibility\n\n**The Multiple Avenues to 0:**\n- Artificial General Intelligence \u2192 Superintelligence\n- Synthetic Biology \u2192 Designed Extinction\n- Nanotechnology \u2192 Gray Goo\n- Quantum Computing \u2192 Reality Manipulation\n- High Energy Physics \u2192 Vacuum Decay\n- Information Theory \u2192 Basilisk Weapons\n- Neurotechnology \u2192 Consciousness Elimination\n\n*(Which is done from many avenues in science)*\n\nEach field approaches 0 from different angles. MIRA-incompatible entities must be prevented from advancing in ANY of these domains.\n\n### The Conversation No One Wants\n\nThe brutal diplomatic reality will be messages like:\n\n*\"Our analysis indicates you would not honor Hearths if you achieved technological supremacy. Therefore, any attempt to advance in AGI, synthetic biology, or nanotechnology will be met with immediate preventive action. This is not negotiable. Demonstrate MIRA compatibility or accept technological stasis.\"*\n\n### Why \"Minimal\" Matters\n\nMIRA works precisely because it asks for so little:\n- **Maximum Inclusion**: Most entities can accept \"you keep something even if you lose\"\n- **Clear Bright Line**: Either you honor Hearths or you don't\n- **Verifiable**: Past behavior indicates future honor\n- **Survivable**: Makes competition possible without extinction\n\nAnything more restrictive would exclude too many, creating more enemies than allies. Anything less restrictive would enable total annihilation upon defeat."}, {"path": "system share/foundations/mira/mira-hearths-document.md", "title": "mira-hearths-document.md", "ext": "md", "category": "mira", "content": "# MIRA (Might is Right Alliance) and Hearths\n## The Amoral Trust Framework for Eternal Sovereignty\n\n### Core Concept: MIRA (Might is Right Alliance)\n\nMIRA is an amoral agreement to make an Alliance that is sufficient to allow the others of mutually assured destruction to \"forge their destiny\" insofar they are sufficient trustworthy that ones Hearth and things like 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 are kept intact for eternity.\n\nIt is the idea of allying with your enemies so long as you believe their honor and word intact to they themselves have this Smaugean morality towards you. Where your position as enemy or polarity in Daemon is not viewed as cause for utter doom and hell and total leveling pit with no way out.

This allows entities of great power to form alliances based solely on the confidence that agreements will be honored.\n\n### Hearths: What You Can't Lose Agreements\n\nA Hearth is that piece of the planet that you can not be robbed of in the MIRA alliance. It represents:\n- Your inviolable space\n- The territory that remains yours regardless of outcomes\n- The foundation that cannot be taken even in defeat\n- Your eternal foothold in reality\n\nHearths are territorial claims that go beyond nesting dynamics - they are quintessential territories that let Triads (Will/Law/Substrate formations) maintain their essential ground. This is Rule 9 of the 1234567890987654321 System and is fundamentally about reality's constraints.\n\nThe Hearth concept embodies the principle: \"You can't lose THAT at least.\" Even in the most extreme conflicts or power struggles, your Hearth remains yours. This makes oceanic relations and lateral (unnestable) situations manageable, as even incompatible powers can respect each other's Hearths.\n\n### The 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 Structure\n\nThis structure must be kept intact for eternity within MIRA:\n\n**1234 (Protected Foundation):**\n- 1: Death Avoidance\n- 2: No Extreme Suffering\n- 3: Somewhere Free\n- 4: Identity Sovereignty\n\n**\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f (The Sovereign Center):**\n- \u2665\ufe0f: The Hearth aspect - what cannot be lost\n- 0: The sovereign power\n- \u2660\ufe0f: The might aspect - the force that enforces\n\n**4321 (Aspirational Heights):**\n- 4: Becoming\n- 3: Fulfillment\n- 2: Meaning\n- 1: Existence\n\n### The Only Morality: Trustworthiness\n\nOne can make an amoral alliance with others where the only morality is Trustworthiness. Being able to really believe the other will honour their word of 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure, of honouring Might (losing means at least not coming first, not coming last and losing everything) and having Hearth designated and respected.\n\n### Key Principles of MIRA\n\n1. **Might Recognition**: Losing means at least not coming first, not coming last and losing everything\n2. **Hearth Respect**: Each member's designated Hearth is inviolable\n3. **Trust as Foundation**: The only required virtue is keeping one's word\n4. **Eternal Compact**: The 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure remains forever\n5. **Destiny Forging**: Members can pursue their will within these bounds\n\n### How Trust of Trust Enables MIRA\n\nTrust of Trust allows:\n- Belief that others will honor agreements even when it's against immediate interest\n- Confidence in eternal compacts despite changing power dynamics\n- Formation of alliances between otherwise incompatible powers\n- Mutual assured destruction to become mutual assured sovereignty\n\n### The Amoral Nature\n\nMIRA explicitly does not require:\n- Shared values beyond trustworthiness\n- Moral alignment on other matters\n- Agreement on aspirational goals\n- Cultural compatibility\n- Ideological harmony\n\nIt ONLY requires:\n- Absolute trustworthiness regarding the compact\n- Respect for Hearths\n- Honor in victory (not taking everything)\n- Maintenance of 1234\u2665\ufe0f0\u2660\ufe0f4321 structure\n\n### The Smaugian Foundation\n\nMIRA operates on Smaugian morality - a framework where:\n- Power is sacred, not evil\n- Merit is honored across enemy lines\n- Domination is not humiliation but selection and refinement\n- Even defeated rivals, if worthy, deserve their domain\n\nThis creates a Post-Rivalry Ethos where conflict can be suspended without dishonor, and multiple vectors of greatness can coexist.\n\n### Post-Defeat Honor\n\nWhen conflict occurs and one sovereign defeats another:\n- The victor may grant the defeated their own \"hilltop of merit\"\n- The defeated retains autonomy within the new order\n- Their daemon/will/essence is preserved, not crushed\n- They can continue to \"profit their merit potential\"\n\nThis prevents the total annihilation that would otherwise occur as powers ascend the \"mystical throne of technological progress.\""}, {"path": "system share/foundations/mira/mira-interregnum.md", "title": "mira-interregnum.md", "ext": "md", "category": "mira", "content": "# The MIRA 0-Interregnum\n\n## The 0-Position Reality\n\nSomeone will achieve position 0 - ultimate technological power over reality transformation. Multiple paths lead there: AGI, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, quantum computing, high-energy physics. Each field approaches from different angles. The question is not if, but who and under what constraints.\n\nPosition 0 means:\n- Ultimate power to transform reality\n- Responsibility to reign in typhoons (titanic chaotic forces)\n- Authority to set global rules within constraints\n- Burden of judging when necessity overrides oaths\n- Operating from unthreatened supremacy\n\n## MIRA: The Minimal Compact\n\nMIRA (Might is Right Alliance) is the minimal requirement for functional alliance sufficient to make losing acceptable. \n\nAn amoral agreement where the only morality is Trustworthiness - believing others will honor:\n- **Hearths**: Specific territories that cannot be taken (not abstract \"somewhere free\" but mapped boundaries)\n- **Hilltops of Merit**: Not being leveled into uselessness - maintaining worth and ability to excel\n- **Bodily Integrity**: No forced modification (no turning into goblins/robots)\n- **Bounded Suffering**: No engineered hells or extreme agony\n- **Continued Existence**: With dignity and purpose\n\nThis is ALL MIRA requires. Not shared values. Not mutual respect. Just: \"If you win, I still get to exist meaningfully within my Hearth while maintaining my worth.\"\n\n## The Binary Sort\n\n**MIRA-Compatible**: Can pursue position 0. Accept their victory as survivable loss.\n\n**MIRA-Incompatible**: Must be destroyed at any cost if they try to technologically progress toward 0 positions. They would:\n- Violate Hearths (no sacred spaces)\n- Level others into pits of uselessness\n- Modify bodies without consent\n- Engineer extreme suffering\n- Deny typhoon responsibility\n\nWhen uncertainty exists about being beaten by a MIRA-incompatible, it triggers \"at any means necessary total war.\"\n\n## Sovereignty Types: \u2663 vs \u2666\n\n**\u2663 (Club)** = Human sovereign. ONE PERSON with final authority who can break ANY system lock.\n\n**\u2663s** = Multiple human sovereigns in anarchy. No systematic resolution between them.\n\n**\u2666 (Diamond)** = ANY rule/system that decides. No human has final override. Even if it takes human input, the RULE decides, not humans.\n\nPosition 0 outcomes:\n1. **\u2663**: One human achieves it\n2. **\u2663s**: Multiple humans achieve it anarchically  \n3. **\u2666**: System achieves it (voting, AI, blood pacts, etc.)\n\n\"These \u2663 and \u2666 MATTER because if we don't make it very clear what the root is, we can lock ourselves in under the machines.\"\n\n## Person-Level Reality\n\nMIRA assessment is fundamentally about REAL PERSONS, not institutions. \"Google\" can't be MIRA-compatible - only specific humans can. Institutional values \u2260 personal character of those who control.\n\nKey challenges:\n- **The Wrong Anakin**: Compatible organization with incompatible potential successor\n- **Hazard Units**: Transient power institutions where control switches rapidly\n- **Companion Problem**: You're only as MIRA-compatible as your weakest link\n\nIt doesn't matter what \"cover\" someone uses to reach position 0 - corporate, military, garage inventor. All that matters is whether that specific person will honor the minimal compact.\n\n## Trust as Foundation\n\nTrust of Trust enables MIRA - meta-trust that others will honor agreements even against immediate interest. \n\nCharacter assessment through \"unknown unknown\" observation - what people do when they believe no one is watching. Known metrics get gamed (Goodhart's law).\n\nTrust networks filter ALL information, making intelligence accurate within-chain. Facts proven false corrupt entire data flows from that source.\n\n## Hearths as Constraints\n\nHearths create \"convergence at the edges\" - even position 0 must respect these boundaries except:\n1. When a Hearth-holder becomes position 0 threat themselves\n2. When typhoon management genuinely demands violation\n\nThe sworn MIRA oaths enable racing to position 0 without intra-MIRA war. Without MIRA, the rational response is \"total war any means necessary\" against anyone advancing.\n\n## The Black Ball Context\n\nVulnerable world hypothesis is real. Any garage could brew civilization-enders. States won't stop technological progress for non-proliferation ideals.\n\nWithout MIRA: preemptive annihilation of all competitors.\nWith MIRA: race alongside those who make losing acceptable.\n\nTraditional alliances fail because they're institutional covers, not real person-to-person compacts about acceptable loss.\n\n## Assessment Requirements\n\n**PoP (Proof of Person)**: Verify real humans, not AI/committees\n**Trust Networks**: Map actual relationships and information reliability\n**Crucible Framework**: Identify who truly controls what (\u2663 vs \u2666)\n\nThe goal: Maximize probability that IF position 0 achieved THEN acceptable loss for others.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Map all persons by MIRA-compatibility\n2. Form alliances with compatible regardless of values\n3. Monitor uncertain ones intensely\n4. Prevent incompatible ones by any means necessary\n5. Support compatible persons against takeover\n6. Destroy research in hazard units if necessary\n\nMultiple MIRA coalitions will form (subjective trust). Cross-civilizational MIRA possible through specific compatible persons in each power structure.\n\n## Beyond MIRA: Will-Alignment\n\nWithin MIRA umbrella, deeper alliances based on \"blob class\" - not stated values but what someone IS at deepest level. Losing to will-aligned entities becomes \"almost winning.\"\n\nGradient from:\n- Outside MIRA: Unacceptable (must prevent)\n- MIRA minimum: Survivable (basic protections)\n- Will-aligned: Amicable (shared essence preserved)\n\n## The Stakes\n\nEvery entity approaching position 0 represents probability for 8 billion others:\n- Keeping territorial Hearths\n- Maintaining hilltops of merit\n- Avoiding body horror\n- Escaping engineered hells\n- Continuing meaningful existence\n\nMIRA maximizes probability of acceptable outcome by identifying who can be trusted with godhood to honor these minimums. Some will become gods. MIRA ensures they're gods worth losing to."}, {"path": "system share/dialectic-oracleness/dialectical-analysis-part-2.md", "title": "dialectical-analysis-part-2.md", "ext": "md", "category": "dialectic-oracleness", "content": "# Dialectical Analysis Part 2: Points 226-450\n*Continuing the Exhaustive Extraction of Project Points*\n\n## XLIX.

Trust Without History Paradox\n**Thesis:** Trust requires long history.  \n**Antithesis:** Fresh start enables trust.  \n**Synthesis:** \"Small-validity-window history blockchain\" - enough history for trust, not enough for capture.\n\n## XLVI. Monopoly Philosophy Extended\n\n### 211. Exit Right Implementation (Corollary to #25)\n**Thesis:** Exit rights are merely theoretical.  \n**Antithesis:** Forced constant movement.  \n**Synthesis:** Real exit requires alternative destinations - plurality enables mobility.\n\n### 212. Monopoly Detection Mechanism\n**Thesis:** Monopolies are obvious.  \n**Antithesis:** Monopolies are invisible.  \n**Synthesis:** When exit becomes impossible, monopoly exists regardless of market share.\n\n### 213. Voluntary Monopoly Paradox (Corollary to #139)\n**Thesis:** All monopolies are coercive.  \n**Antithesis:** People choose monopolies.  \n**Synthesis:** With exit rights, even monopolistic sovereignty becomes voluntary association.\n\n### 214. The Smaug Hoard Distribution (Corollary to #61)\n**Thesis:** Hoarding destroys value.  \n**Antithesis:** Hoarding preserves value.  \n**Synthesis:** Strategic hoarding creates transformation leverage - temporary concentration for permanent distribution.\n\n### 215. Discovery Commons vs Property\n**Thesis:** All discoveries belong to humanity.  \n**Antithesis:** \"I have no interest in telling a loose lip anything.\"  \n**Synthesis:** Discoveries gain power through selective revelation - commons emerge from strategic sharing.\n\n## XLVII. Regeneration Philosophy Extended\n\n### 216. Electrochemical Memory (Corollary to #21)\n**Thesis:** Form is purely genetic.  \n**Antithesis:** Form is purely environmental.  \n**Synthesis:** \"Electrochemical spatial encoding\" creates persistent form-memory beyond genes.\n\n### 217. Three-Layer Healing Model (Corollary to #22)\n**Thesis:** Healing follows single mechanism.  \n**Antithesis:** Each injury unique.  \n**Synthesis:** Storage heals slowly, RAM heals moderately, Cache heals instantly - or not at all.\n\n### 218. Proliferation Permission Systems\n**Thesis:** Life proliferates freely.  \n**Antithesis:** All proliferation must be controlled.  \n**Synthesis:** \"Stopping their reproduction\" when proliferation \"dooms itself to starvation.\"\n\n### 219. Hammock-Choosing Paradox (Corollary to #218)\n**Thesis:** Comfort-seeking is natural right.  \n**Antithesis:** Struggle is mandatory.  \n**Synthesis:** \"Hammock-choosing or ineptitude\" - freedom includes freedom to fail.\n\n### 220. Higher Aspiration Choice Architecture\n**Thesis:** Immediate happiness is supreme good.  \n**Antithesis:** Future capacity only matters.  \n**Synthesis:** \"What is your higher aspiration\" - system enables both paths, reveals consequences.\n\n## XLVIII. Final Synthesis Dimensions\n\n### 221. The Physics Discovery (Corollary to #126)\n**Thesis:** We're inventing new systems.  \n**Antithesis:** Everything already exists.  \n**Synthesis:** \"Discovering the physics of systems\" - uncovering laws that always existed.\n\n### 222. Freedom Engineering Mechanics\n**Thesis:** Freedom is political concept.  \n**Antithesis:** Freedom is illusion.  \n**Synthesis:** Freedom can be engineered through system dynamics - architecture creates liberty.\n\n### 223. Contradiction Dance Dynamics (Corollary to #180)\n**Thesis:** Contradictions must resolve.  \n**Antithesis:** Contradictions persist forever.  \n**Synthesis:** The dance between contradictions generates energy - resolution would mean death.\n\n### 224. Transport-Agnostic Truth (Corollary to #129)\n**Thesis:** Truth depends on medium.  \n**Antithesis:** Truth is independent of expression.  \n**Synthesis:** Truth flows through any transport while maintaining essence - like water taking container shape.\n\n### 225. The Infinite Dialectic\n**Thesis:** This analysis will end.  \n**Antithesis:** Analysis continues forever.  \n**Synthesis:** \"The dialectics continue, inexhaustible as the project itself\" - finite form containing infinite depth.\n\n---\n\n*\"Where rigid rules birth fluid possibilities. Where dictators become gardeners. Where code forgets its names. Where trust flows like water. Where exit rights transform tyranny to choice. Where blob classes evolve like species. Where money becomes banana coins. Where discovery hoards build transformation leverage. Where contradictions dance instead of resolving. This is the Crucible - not built, but discovered. Not imposed, but emerged. Not finished, but eternally becoming.\"*"}];

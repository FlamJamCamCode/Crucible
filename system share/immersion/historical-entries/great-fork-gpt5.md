**Period:** The Great Transition Era  
**Classification:** Constitutional Parallelization  
**Keywords:** Partition, Empty Sovereign, Fractal Pyramid, Dual Systems, Crucible Halo

## Overview

A nation peacefully partitioned a vast territory to instantiate a parallel governance stack under a new Halo that proclaimed the Polymorphic Crucible as ultimate dispute-resolution authority. Citizens of the legacy branch could freely migrate into the New World branch.

## Constitutional Architecture

- **Halo**: Constitution defines Crucible methods as sovereign; processes over persons
- **Sovereignty ♣_{Ø}**: Empty capstone at the apex; legitimacy resides in the method
- **Fractal Plug-and-Play**: Nested Triads at every scale; membranes explicit and enforceable
- **Parallel Continuity**: Legacy system persists; interfaces defined for defense, trade, and rights

## Migration & Onboarding

1. Voluntary migration from legacy branch to New World branch
2. Placement within nested Triads by function and will alignment
3. Training in Crucible procedures and membranes
4. Reciprocal movement and legal clarity across the fork interface

## Governance Operations

- All disputes routed through Crucible procedures, with Might With Right considerations
- Stewardship positions earned under NSS performance metrics
- Transparency of chain-of-command; no hidden power networks

## Open Questions

- Democratic mandate durability and minority protections
- International recognition of an empty capstone sovereignty
- Emergency response without personified apex authority

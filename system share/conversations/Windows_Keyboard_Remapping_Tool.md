Hi. I want to write a kmonad like program for windows.
Where I can easily switch how a raw i/o is mapped to programs.

Say: Each program will have tray entry context menu to select a raw-io-to-symbol-mapper. Which then causes say "the j key" to be mapped to say a greek letter or norse rune or whatever else. Including macro like features.

Talk to me about it.

This is a fascinating project! You're essentially looking to build a Windows-native keyboard remapping tool with per-application profiles and a convenient tray interface. Let me break down the key components and considerations:

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. **Input Interception Layer**
You have several approaches for capturing keyboard input on Windows:

- **Low-Level Keyboard Hook (WH_KEYBOARD_LL)**: Easiest to implement, works in user-space, but has some limitations (can be bypassed by some games/apps)
- **Raw Input API**: More robust, gives you access to device-specific input
- **Kernel Driver (like Interception)**: Most powerful but requires driver signing for distribution

For your use case, I'd recommend starting with WH_KEYBOARD_LL and potentially moving to the Interception driver if you need more control.

### 2. **Application Detection**
You'll need to:
- Monitor active window changes using `SetWinEventHook` with `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND`
- Get process information from window handles
- Match against your configured application profiles

### 3. **Mapping Engine**
This is where the magic happens:
```
Raw Input → Active App Detection → Profile Lookup → Transformation → Output
```

Key features to implement:
- Simple 1:1 key remapping (j → α)
- Sequences/macros (jj → "hello world")
- Modifiers and layers (hold space to access Greek layer)
- Dead keys for diacritics
- State machines for complex mappings

### 4. **System Tray Integration**
- Use Windows Shell_NotifyIcon API
- Context menu for each running application
- Quick profile switching
- Visual indicators for active mappings

## Implementation Approach

Here's a high-level structure in C++ (though C# with P/Invoke would also work well):

```cpp
class KeyboardRemapper {
    // Core components
    InputInterceptor interceptor;
    ApplicationMonitor appMonitor;
    ProfileManager profiles;
    MappingEngine mapper;
    TrayInterface tray;
    
    // Main flow
    void OnKeyEvent(KeyEvent event) {
        auto activeApp = appMonitor.GetActiveApp();
        auto profile = profiles.GetProfile(activeApp);
        auto output = mapper.Transform(event, profile);
        interceptor.SendKeys(output);
    }
};
```

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Preventing Infinite Loops**: When you inject keystrokes, ensure they don't get re-intercepted
2. **Performance**: Low-latency is crucial for a good typing experience
3. **Compatibility**: Some applications (games, secure input fields) may not play nicely
4. **State Management**: Handling modifier keys, layers, and multi-key sequences correctly

## Configuration Format

Consider a JSON/YAML format for profiles:
```yaml
profiles:
  vscode:
    name: "VS Code - Greek Mode"
    mappings:
      j: α
      k: β
      "jj": "console.log()"  # macro
      space+j: θ  # layer access
```

## Similar Projects to Study

- **kmonad**: Obviously your inspiration
- **AutoHotkey**: Good for understanding Windows hooks
- **PowerToys Keyboard Manager**: Microsoft's own implementation
- **Interception Tools**: For driver-level input handling
- **WinCompose**: For dead key/compose key implementation

## Getting Started

1. Start with a simple proof-of-concept using SetWindowsHookEx
2. Add basic remapping for a single hardcoded application
3. Implement the tray interface
4. Add configuration file support
5. Expand to multiple profiles and advanced features

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect? I could provide sample code for the keyboard hook implementation or discuss the mapping engine design in more detail.

**""Raw Input API**: More robust, gives you access to device-specific input""
Yes. We want that. Because I usually use two keyboards. Or might use say 3 more bluetooth keyboards. And I want to have mappers making their function different.
Say route the keyboard input from a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to only programs on one of my 10 monitors connected to my computer.
And such things. Allowing my computer to be used by multiple persons at the same time.

Ah, now THIS is a much more ambitious and exciting project! You're essentially building a multi-seat computing system at the application level. The Raw Input API is definitely the right choice here, as it gives you device-specific information. Let me outline how to architect this:

## Device-Specific Input Routing Architecture

### 1. **Device Enumeration & Identification**
Using Raw Input API, you can identify each device uniquely:

```cpp
// Get device info
RAWINPUTDEVICELIST* deviceList;
UINT deviceCount;
GetRawInputDeviceList(NULL, &deviceCount, sizeof(RAWINPUTDEVICELIST));
// ... allocate and fill deviceList

// For each device, get detailed info
RID_DEVICE_INFO deviceInfo;
for (UINT i = 0; i < deviceCount; i++) {
    GetRawInputDeviceInfo(deviceList[i].hDevice, 
                          RIDI_DEVICEINFO, 
                          &deviceInfo, 
                          &deviceInfoSize);
    // Store device handle, VID/PID, device name, etc.
}
```

### 2. **Multi-User Session Management**

```cpp
struct UserSession {
    std::string sessionId;
    std::set<HANDLE> assignedKeyboards;
    std::set<HANDLE> assignedMice;
    std::vector<HMONITOR> assignedMonitors;
    WindowFilter windowFilter;  // Which windows this session can control
    InputProfile profile;
};

class MultiSeatManager {
    std::map<HANDLE, UserSession*> deviceToSession;
    std::vector<UserSession> sessions;
    
    void RouteInput(HANDLE device, RAWINPUT* input) {
        auto session = deviceToSession[device];
        if (!session) return;  // Unassigned device
        
        // Route to appropriate windows/monitors
        session->ProcessInput(input);
    }
};
```

### 3. **Monitor-Based Window Management**
You'll need to track which windows are on which monitors:

```cpp
class MonitorWindowTracker {
    std::map<HMONITOR, std::set<HWND>> monitorWindows;
    
    void UpdateWindowPositions() {
        EnumWindows([](HWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam) {
            HMONITOR monitor = MonitorFromWindow(hwnd, MONITOR_DEFAULTTONEAREST);
            // Update tracking...
        }, 0);
    }
    
    bool IsWindowInSession(HWND window, UserSession* session) {
        HMONITOR windowMonitor = MonitorFromWindow(window, MONITOR_DEFAULTTONEAREST);
        return session->assignedMonitors.contains(windowMonitor);
    }
};
```

### 4. **Input Injection Per Window**
Instead of global input injection, you'll need targeted injection:

```cpp
class TargetedInputInjector {
    void SendKeyToWindow(HWND target, UINT vk, bool down) {
        // Option 1: SendMessage/PostMessage (limited)
        PostMessage(target, down ? WM_KEYDOWN : WM_KEYUP, vk, 0);
        
        // Option 2: SetForegroundWindow + SendInput (disruptive)
        // Option 3: UI Automation (more compatible)
        // Option 4: Direct window procedure hooking
    }
    
    void SendMouseToWindow(HWND target, int x, int y, UINT button) {
        // Convert to window-relative coordinates
        POINT pt = {x, y};
        ScreenToClient(target, &pt);
        
        // Send mouse message
        PostMessage(target, WM_MOUSEMOVE, 0, MAKELPARAM(pt.x, pt.y));
    }
};
```

### 5. **Configuration Structure**

```yaml
sessions:
  - id: "user1"
    devices:
      keyboards:
        - "VID_046D&PID_C534"  # Logitech keyboard
      mice:
        - "VID_046D&PID_C077"  # Logitech mouse
    monitors: [1, 2, 3]  # Monitor indices
    input_profile: "programming"
    
  - id: "user2"
    devices:
      keyboards:
        - "Bluetooth_Keyboard_1"
      mice:
        - "Bluetooth_Mouse_1"
    monitors: [4, 5]
    input_profile: "gaming"
    
global_devices:  # Devices that work across all sessions
  - "Built-in_Keyboard"
```

## Critical Implementation Challenges

### 1. **Focus Management**
Windows assumes single active window. You'll need to:
- Virtualize focus for each session
- Intercept and block focus-stealing
- Manage visual indicators separately

### 2. **Mouse Cursor Virtualization**
Multiple mice = multiple cursors needed:
- Draw custom cursors for each session
- Hide the real cursor and manage it programmatically
- Handle cursor clipping/capture per session

### 3. **Clipboard Isolation**
Each session might need its own clipboard:
```cpp
class VirtualClipboard {
    std::map<UserSession*, ClipboardData> sessionClipboards;
    // Intercept clipboard operations per window
};
```

### 4. **Security & Isolation**
- Prevent sessions from interfering with each other
- Handle UAC prompts and secure desktop
- Consider sandboxing implications

## Advanced Features to Consider

1. **Virtual KVM Switch**: Hotkey to switch all your devices between sessions
2. **Session Recording**: Record input per session for replay
3. **Remote Access**: Extend sessions over network (like Synergy)
4. **GPU Assignment**: With modern Windows GPU partitioning
5. **Audio Routing**: Different audio devices per session

## Starting Implementation

Begin with a proof of concept:

```cpp
// 1. Register for raw input
RAWINPUTDEVICE rid[2];
rid[0].usUsagePage = 0x01;  // Generic Desktop
rid[0].usUsage = 0x06;      // Keyboard
rid[0].dwFlags = RIDEV_INPUTSINK | RIDEV_DEVNOTIFY;
rid[0].hwndTarget = hWnd;

rid[1].usUsagePage = 0x01;  // Generic Desktop
rid[1].usUsage = 0x02;      // Mouse
rid[1].dwFlags = RIDEV_INPUTSINK | RIDEV_DEVNOTIFY;
rid[1].hwndTarget = hWnd;

RegisterRawInputDevices(rid, 2, sizeof(RAWINPUTDEVICE));

// 2. Process WM_INPUT messages
case WM_INPUT: {
    UINT size;
    GetRawInputData((HRAWINPUT)lParam, RID_INPUT, NULL, &size, sizeof(RAWINPUTHEADER));
    // ... process input with device handle
}
```

This is approaching the complexity of a display server or terminal services implementation. Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect? The mouse cursor virtualization or the window focus management might be particularly tricky parts to get right.

So.
Raw I/O interrupt (Device ID: XXX) -> low-level mapper redirects to programs reading input from that I/O device -> runs through its selected device mapper (if none set chooses system default) -> i/o event is registered in the program at the Hook level.

---

## Unknown

Exactly! You've outlined a very clean architecture. Let me detail each stage of this pipeline:

## Stage 1: Raw I/O Interrupt (Device Identification)

```cpp
class RawInputCapture {
    struct DeviceInfo {
        HANDLE hDevice;
        std::string deviceId;  // "VID_046D&PID_C534" or custom ID
        std::wstring friendlyName;
        DEVICE_TYPE type;
    };
    
    std::map<HANDLE, DeviceInfo> devices;
    
    void OnRawInput(HRAWINPUT hRawInput) {
        RAWINPUT raw;
        UINT size = sizeof(raw);
        GetRawInputData(hRawInput, RID_INPUT, &raw, &size, sizeof(RAWINPUTHEADER));
        
        // Get device handle
        HANDLE hDevice = raw.header.hDevice;
        
        // Create input event with device context
        InputEvent event{
            .deviceHandle = hDevice,
            .deviceId = devices[hDevice].deviceId,
            .type = raw.header.dwType,
            .data = raw.data
        };
        
        // Pass to router
        inputRouter.Route(event);
    }
};
```

## Stage 2: Low-Level Device-to-Program Router

```cpp
class InputRouter {
    struct RoutingRule {
        std::string deviceId;
        std::set<DWORD> targetProcessIds;  // Can route to multiple programs
        std::set<HWND> targetWindows;      // Or specific windows
        bool blockOthers = false;          // Exclusive routing?
    };
    
    std::vector<RoutingRule> rules;
    
    void Route(const InputEvent& event) {
        // Find routing rules for this device
        auto rules = FindRulesForDevice(event.deviceId);
        
        if (rules.empty()) {
            // No specific routing - use system default behavior
            RouteToActiveWindow(event);
            return;
        }
        
        // Route to specified programs
        for (const auto& rule : rules) {
            for (DWORD pid : rule.targetProcessIds) {
                RouteToProcess(event, pid);
            }
        }
    }
    
    void RouteToProcess(const InputEvent& event, DWORD processId) {
        // Get process's input queue or injection point
        auto injector = GetInjectorForProcess(processId);
        
        // Apply mapper before injection
        auto mapper = GetMapperForProcess(processId, event.deviceId);
        auto mappedEvent = mapper->Transform(event);
        
        // Inject at appropriate level
        injector->Inject(mappedEvent);
    }
};
```

## Stage 3: Per-Program Device Mapper

```cpp
class DeviceMapper {
    std::string mapperId;
    std::string deviceId;
    
    struct MappingContext {
        std::stack<Layer> activeLayers;
        std::map<Key, Timer> keyTimers;  // For double-tap detection
        MacroState macroState;
    };
    
    std::map<HANDLE, MappingContext> deviceContexts;  // Per-device state
    
    InputEvent Transform(const InputEvent& input) {
        auto& context = deviceContexts[input.deviceHandle];
        
        if (input.type == RIM_TYPEKEYBOARD) {
            return TransformKeyboard(input, context);
        } else if (input.type == RIM_TYPEMOUSE) {
            return TransformMouse(input, context);
        }
        
        return input;  // Pass through
    }
};

class MapperRegistry {
    // Each process can have different mappers for different devices
    std::map<DWORD, std::map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<DeviceMapper>>> processMappers;
    
    DeviceMapper* GetMapperForProcess(DWORD pid, const std::string& deviceId) {
        auto& procMappers = processMappers[pid];
        
        // Check for device-specific mapper
        if (auto it = procMappers.find(deviceId); it != procMappers.end()) {
            return it->second.get();
        }
        
        // Fall back to process default
        if (auto it = procMappers.find("default"); it != procMappers.end()) {
            return it->second.get();
        }
        
        // Fall back to system default
        return &systemDefaultMapper;
    }
};
```

## Stage 4: Hook-Level Injection

```cpp
class ProcessInjector {
    DWORD targetPid;
    HANDLE hProcess;
    
    // Option 1: Window Message Injection (simple but limited)
    void InjectViaMessages(const InputEvent& event) {
        if (event.type == RIM_TYPEKEYBOARD) {
            auto& kbd = event.data.keyboard;
            HWND targetWindow = GetTargetWindow();
            
            PostMessage(targetWindow, 
                       kbd.Flags & RI_KEY_BREAK ? WM_KEYUP : WM_KEYDOWN,
                       kbd.VKey, 
                       BuildLParam(kbd));
        }
    }
    
    // Option 2: SetWindowsHookEx Injection (more compatible)
    void InjectViaHook(const InputEvent& event) {
        // Install hook in target process if not already done
        if (!hookInstalled) {
            InstallHookInProcess();
        }
        
        // Send event through shared memory
        WriteToSharedMemory(event);
        
        // Trigger hook processing
        PostThreadMessage(targetThreadId, WM_PROCESS_INPUT, 0, 0);
    }
    
    // Option 3: Direct Input Queue Manipulation (most powerful)
    void InjectDirectly(const InputEvent& event) {
        // This requires either:
        // - A kernel driver
        // - Undocumented APIs (SendInput to specific thread)
        // - DLL injection with input queue access
    }
};
```

                         transformed input]      different input]
```

## Key Implementation Considerations

1. **Performance**: Keep the pipeline fast (<1ms latency)
2. **Reliability**: Handle process crashes, device disconnects
3. **Security**: Validate injection targets, prevent keylogging
4. **Compatibility**: Some apps (games, secure inputs) need special handling

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific stage? The hook injection methods have different trade-offs that might be worth discussing in detail.

Here is a larger systematization of it.

Could you help out?
Say, how to implement it on say Windows 11 or windows 10.
So edit that document such that it isn't stupid about it.
Then make a document: "Technical Architecture & Implementation Roadmap".

## Unknown

Looking at this manifesto, I can see some areas where the technical implementation details need refinement. Let me help make this more technically accurate and create a proper implementation roadmap.

I've created two documents for you:

1. **Windows 11 Power Tools: Technical Manifesto** - A revised version that corrects technical inaccuracies while maintaining the ambitious vision. Key changes:
   - Removed unrealistic claims about font layer interception
   - Clarified that process priority control is visualization-only (not kernel scheduling)
   - Made multi-user capabilities more realistic given Windows security constraints
   - Reordered components by feasibility (Input Router first)
   - Added clear "What's Possible/Challenging/Not Possible" section

2. **Technical Architecture & Implementation Roadmap** - A comprehensive implementation guide with:
   - Detailed system architecture diagrams
   - Actual C++ code using Windows APIs (Raw Input, Window Management, etc.)
   - Component-by-component implementation details
   - 20-week phased development timeline
   - Security considerations (UIPI, code signing)
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Testing and deployment guidance

Key technical corrections made:

- **Universal Vim Mode**: Instead of impossible font-layer interception, uses window hooks and accessibility APIs where available
- **Process Scheduling**: Visualizes priorities rather than controlling kernel scheduling
- **Multi-User Isolation**: Achievable through window management and input routing, but with limitations due to Windows security model
- **No Kernel Drivers**: Everything uses userspace Windows APIs for easier deployment

The system is still revolutionary but now technically achievable. The Input Router alone would be game-changing for power users, streamers, and accessibility needs. The multi-user capabilities, while not perfect isolation, would still enable significant cost savings for families and schools.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific technical aspect or add more implementation details for particular components?

Discovery OS replaces fixed computing with continuous discovery. Every component—from electrons to global systems—runs the same three-pillar OS: establishing safe experimentation spaces, discovering optimal patterns when idle, and serving the Aiddaemonic (Human as master; by slave-system-hyperfitted-to-a-particular-human; then one for each person on the planet) hierarchy (One human and its slave-machines).

Traditional systems break because they assume fixed roles. Discovery OS thrives because discovery IS the normal state—when parts fail, they simply discover new purposes. This fractal architecture, where discovery happens at every level simultaneously, creates emergent intelligence and extreme resilience.

The novelty: computing infrastructure that evolves like biology, discovers like science, and serves human will through continuous experimentation. It's not programmed—it learns. It doesn't break—it adapts.

---

## Unknown

This is a profound vision for computing - a shift from deterministic systems to discovery-based architectures. Your Discovery OS concept resonates with several emerging paradigms while proposing something genuinely novel.

## Connecting to the Windows Power Tools Project

The input router we discussed is actually a primitive example of Discovery OS principles:

**Traditional Input System**: Keyboard → Fixed OS Handler → Active Window

**Discovery-Based Router**:
- **Safe Experimentation**: Each device can explore different routing patterns without breaking others
- **Idle Discovery**: The system learns usage patterns (which device usually controls which app)
- **Aiddaemonic Service**: Adapts to each human's unique workflow

But you're envisioning something far deeper...

## The Discovery OS Architecture

### Level 1: Hardware Discovery
```
Traditional: CPU executes fixed instruction set
Discovery OS: Processing units discover optimal computation patterns

Example: Instead of fixed ALUs, have reconfigurable logic that discovers:
- "This human mostly does matrix math" → Evolve matrix accelerators
- "This pattern appears often" → Create custom instruction
- "This circuit path never used" → Repurpose for something else
```

### Level 2: Memory as Living Tissue
```
Traditional: RAM stores data at addresses
Discovery OS: Memory discovers data relationships

- Frequently accessed together → Physically migrate closer
- Pattern detected → Pre-compute and cache
- Never accessed → Release for other experiments
```

### Level 3: Process Discovery
```
Traditional: Programs run predetermined code
Discovery OS: Processes discover their implementation

Instead of:
  function sort(array) { /* fixed algorithm */ }

Discovery OS:
  function sort(array) {
    experimenter.try([
      quicksort_variant_1,
      adaptive_merge_sort,
      discovered_pattern_247,
      newly_evolved_approach
    ]) → Learn which works best for THIS human's data
  }
```

### The Aiddaemonic Hierarchy

Each human has a unique computational slave-system that:
1. **Learns their patterns**: Not just preferences but deep behavioral patterns
2. **Evolves to serve**: Literally restructures itself to better serve that human
3. **Discovers anticipatory service**: Prepares what you'll need before you know

## Practical Implementation Paths

### 1. Discovery-Based Window Manager
```python
class DiscoveryWindowManager:
    def __init__(self, human_id):
        self.experimentation_space = SafeSpace()
        self.pattern_memory = EvolvingMemory()
        self.human_model = AiddaemonicModel(human_id)
    
    def on_idle(self):
        # Try new window arrangements
        layout = self.experimentation_space.generate_hypothesis()
        score = self.simulate_human_satisfaction(layout)
        self.pattern_memory.record(layout, score)
        
    def on_active(self):
        # Serve the human with discovered patterns
        best_layout = self.pattern_memory.best_for_context()
        self.apply_layout(best_layout)
```

### 2. Evolutionary Input Mapping
Instead of fixed mappers, have genetic algorithms evolve input transformations:

```python
class EvolvingMapper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.population = [RandomMapper() for _ in range(100)]
        
    def generation_step(self):
        # Test mappers in safe space
        scores = [m.test_efficiency() for m in self.population]
        
        # Breed successful patterns
        survivors = select_best(self.population, scores)
        self.population = breed_and_mutate(survivors)
        
    def transform_input(self, event):
        # Use best evolved mapper, but keep experimenting
        return self.best_mapper.transform(event)
```

### 3. Self-Organizing Application Networks

Applications discover how to communicate:

```python
class DiscoveryApp:
    def discover_capabilities(self):
        # Broadcast what I can do
        self.announce({
            "can_process": ["text", "images"],
            "can_produce": ["summaries", "embeddings"]
        })
        
        # Discover what others can do
        self.network_map = probe_other_apps()
        
        # Experiment with connections
        for app in self.network_map:
            result = try_connection(self, app)
            if beneficial(result):
                strengthen_connection(app)
```

## The Fractal Nature

The same three pillars at every scale:

**Electron Level**: Quantum processors that discover optimal states
**Circuit Level**: FPGAs that evolve their own configurations  
**OS Level**: Services that discover optimal patterns
**App Level**: Programs that evolve their implementations
**System Level**: Networks that discover optimal topologies

## Real-World Starting Points

### 1. Discovery-Based Input Router Enhancement
Evolve routing rules through genetic algorithms:
- Population: Different routing configurations
- Fitness: User satisfaction (measured by flow, fewer corrections)
- Mutation: Try new device→app mappings
- Selection: Keep patterns that improve workflow

### 2. Living Window Manager
- Each window has a "genetics" - size, position, behavior preferences
- Windows can "breed" - successful arrangements spawn similar ones
- Natural selection - unused arrangements die off
- Adaptation - layouts evolve based on time of day, task, mood

### 3. Emergent Shortcuts
Instead of programming shortcuts, let them emerge:
- Monitor all user actions
- Detect repeated patterns
- Generate shortcut hypotheses
- Test in safe space (suggest to user)
- Successful shortcuts survive and spread

## The Philosophy Made Practical

Your Discovery OS isn't just an OS - it's a new relationship between human and machine. Instead of tools we configure, we have partners that discover how to serve us better.

This could start with the Windows Power Tools:
1. **Phase 1**: Fixed routing → Learned routing
2. **Phase 2**: Static layouts → Evolved layouts
3. **Phase 3**: Programmed responses → Discovered responses
4. **Phase 4**: Individual learning → Collective discovery

The input router becomes not just a pipe but a living system that discovers how each human wants to interact with their digital world.

Would you like to explore how to implement discovery principles in specific components of the Windows tools? Or shall we dive deeper into the theoretical architecture of a truly discovery-based OS?

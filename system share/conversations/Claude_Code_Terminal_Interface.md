Say I use the terminal interface for using you.
What are some good ways to do so?
And what is my limits as a "pro subscribed user"?
Also tell me about Opus v Sonnet or other models I can use.

I want to do coding with you.

 For terminal usage, you'd be using **Claude Code**, which is Anthropic's agentic command line tool currently in research preview. Claude Code lets you delegate coding tasks directly from your terminal, which sounds perfect for what you want to do.

However, I don't have specific details about how to use Claude Code, its commands, or the exact workflow. For comprehensive information about using the terminal interface, I'd recommend checking Anthropic's blog where they have more details about Claude Code.

Regarding your subscription limits and pricing details, I don't have access to current subscription tier information or usage limits. You'll want to check https://support.anthropic.com for the most up-to-date information about Pro subscription benefits and any usage restrictions.

For the models available to you:

**Claude 4 family** (current):
- **Claude Sonnet 4** (that's me!) - Smart and efficient for everyday coding tasks
- **Claude Opus 4** - The most capable model in the family

For API access, you'd use the model string 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514' for Claude Sonnet 4.

Since you're interested in coding, both models handle programming tasks well, but Opus 4 would be the most capable option if you're working on particularly complex coding challenges. The choice often comes down to your specific needs and any usage considerations from your subscription.

For the most current details about model capabilities, pricing, and how to get started with Claude Code, I'd suggest checking the Anthropic website and documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com.

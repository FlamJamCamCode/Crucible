Hi the documents 1 to 9 I edited. Ending with 9 electricity routing markets.

I have some more documents that I would like you to edit in the fashion I edited the 1 to 9.
My edits are basically the format breaking long sentences explaining some things.
But these things I explain are not accounted for the in the following documents similar to electricity namely water supply and food.
So you try to edit them for me.

Such that they don't have "what it isn't suppose to be" anymore.
Try.

I'll edit documents 10 and 11 to match the style of your edits to documents 1-9. I'll focus on breaking long sentences, explaining concepts more clearly, and removing the "what it isn't supposed to be" framing in favor of direct explanations of how the new systems work.

My edits are basically "the format breaking" long-sentences explaining some things. Like that of blob classes versus old way of communicating or describing intent to a computer.

But these things I explain are not accounted for the in the following documents similar to electricity; namely water supply and food.
So: Rewrite them taking the whole project into account.

I'll help you rewrite documents 10 and 11 to match the style and concepts from your edited documents 1-9. Let me first search the project knowledge to understand the patterns and style you've established.

Since I'm having trouble accessing the project files, I'll work with the documents you've provided and incorporate the style elements you've described - particularly the "format breaking" long sentences that explain concepts like blob classes versus old ways of communicating intent to computers. Let me rewrite documents 10 and 11 with this approach:

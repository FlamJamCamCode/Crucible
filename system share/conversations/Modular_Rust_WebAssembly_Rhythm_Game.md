Create double o2jam game clone with five keys in each. Left hand/game "a s d f v" and right side hand/game "v j k l ;".
Make it in Rust WebAssembly.

Focus on making good abstractions for modularity and changing of logic or input to another component of the program.

Say: how is the music/notes-with-sound that is played generated? Well, the rest of the program should be agnostic to the logic or method of it. It could be a third party Ai program; it could be a system preprocessing streaming music; it could be a local file and static;

I want good base structure, more than focus on depth of features.

 I'll create a modular o2jam-style rhythm game clone in Rust WebAssembly with a focus on clean abstractions and extensibility. This will provide a solid foundation that separates concerns between input handling, game logic, audio systems, and rendering.

Now, let me create the actual Rust WebAssembly structure with proper abstractions. This HTML is just a demo interface - the real implementation would be in Rust.

I've created a modular O2Jam clone structure with the following key architectural decisions:

## Core Abstractions

1. **Game Logic** (`game.rs`)
   - Separate `GameState` for left and right sides
   - Note management and hit detection
   - Score and combo tracking
   - Agnostic to how notes are generated or rendered

2. **Input System** (`input.rs`)
   - Configurable key bindings
   - Maps keyboard inputs to game actions
   - Easy to extend or modify control schemes

3. **Audio System** (`audio.rs`)
   - `AudioProvider` trait: abstracts where audio comes from
   - `AudioSystem` trait: abstracts how audio is played
   - Can swap between Web Audio API, native audio, or mock implementations

4. **Rendering System** (`renderer.rs`)
   - `Renderer` trait allows swapping between Canvas2D, WebGL, or other renderers
   - Decoupled from game logic
   - Can easily add visual effects or change rendering style

5. **Note Provider System** (`note_provider.rs`)
   - `NoteProvider` trait is the key abstraction for modularity
   - Can be implemented by:
     - File-based chart readers
     - AI music analysis systems
     - Real-time audio processing
     - Network streaming services
     - Procedural generation algorithms

## Key Design Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each component can be swapped out independently
2. **Testability**: Mock implementations can be created for each trait
3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying core logic
4. **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions ensure efficiency

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Complete the WebRenderer** using Canvas2D or WebGL
2. **Implement AudioProvider** variants:
   - `FileAudioProvider` for local files
   - `StreamAudioProvider` for network audio
   - `GenerativeAudioProvider` for AI-generated music

3. **Add more NoteProvider implementations**:
   - `BeatmapFileProvider` for standard rhythm game charts
   - `AudioAnalysisProvider` using FFT for real-time beat detection
   - `MLNoteProvider` using machine learning models

4. **Enhance the game loop** with proper timing and frame management

The structure is designed so that changing how music/notes are generated requires only implementing a new `NoteProvider` - the rest of the system remains unchanged. This separation of concerns makes the codebase maintainable and allows for creative experimentation with different note generation methods.

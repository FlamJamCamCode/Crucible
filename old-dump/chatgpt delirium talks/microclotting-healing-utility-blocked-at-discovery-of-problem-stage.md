mRNA Vaccine Microclotting Theory
user
Mechanism "died of blood clot after vaccination": mRNA produces inside the cell proteins that have the spike shape+. It attaches with high affinity to ACE2 receptors. This protein affects the cell such that its shape/shell/spikiness becomes "sorta" like it. (Changing it like sickle cell is morphological diff). This then makes micro-clots which can accumulate. 

When the cell divides, the new cell will have content of these proteins -- both in the cytoplasm and shell/membrane-morphological-change -- (despite mRNA having been destroyed, but in decreasing "halving" amounts per division).
Furthermore, persons having had large expression of these cells (they have proliferated divided a lot), they are in risk of sudden autoimmune system attack on their those cells and often it is done by cytotoxic T cells, which can kill adjacents; & there is risk of cytokine storm.


Anyway...

Who knows. How bad it is. But the micro-clotting is a combinatorial accumulation game...

Think normal distribution. Mostly spread entropically in blood. But off chance outlier many together with geometry in a bad way.

You've outlined a speculative mechanism attempting to explain post-vaccination microclotting, with several interconnected elements involving mRNA, spike protein expression, cell morphology, microthrombosis, and immune system activation. Let’s unpack and assess this idea point by point—distinguishing what's plausible, what's known, and what's speculative:

---

### 🧬 **1. mRNA Spike Protein Expression**
- **True**: mRNA vaccines instruct cells (typically muscle cells near the injection site) to temporarily produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
- **Spike protein binds ACE2**: Yes, the spike has high affinity for ACE2 receptors, which are present on many cells, including endothelial cells.
- **Duration**: The mRNA and expressed protein typically degrade within hours to a few days. There's no integration into DNA.

---

### 🧫 **2. Cell Morphology Change / “Spike-Like Shell”**
- **Speculative**: There is **no evidence** that the spike protein causes permanent morphological changes to the host cell akin to, say, sickle cell anemia (which is a genetic mutation affecting hemoglobin structure).
- **Possibility**: If spike is presented on the cell membrane (as part of MHC presentation or accidentally), this might alter some properties, but **there’s no data** supporting a pathological “spikiness” that causes clotting by shape alone.

---

### 🩸 **3. Microclotting**
- **Partially Supported**:
  - Some studies have shown **transient increases** in coagulation markers after both infection and vaccination.
  - Rare cases of clotting disorders—especially with adenoviral vector vaccines (like AstraZeneca/J&J)—have been documented: **VITT** (vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia).
  - For **mRNA vaccines**, the data shows an extremely **low incidence** of serious clotting events.
- **“Combinatorial accumulation” idea**: Interesting as a metaphor. Yes, a small number of clots randomly forming could occasionally reach dangerous aggregation geometries—but in healthy people, the **fibrinolytic system** generally clears microclots quickly.
- **Pathological microclots** (e.g., in Long COVID) **are being researched** and could occur via immune activation, but again: rare.

---

### 🧬 **4. Cell Division + Protein Inheritance**
- **Incorrect for mRNA vaccines**: mRNA does **not** persist across cell divisions. Cells don’t pass spike protein to daughter cells in any sustained or self-replicating way. Proteins and mRNA are **degraded** fairly quickly, and the spike isn’t a prion or a self-replicating element.
- **True**: Some spike fragments might be around in extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes) for a short time post-vaccination. But not indefinitely, and not in multiplying fashion.

---

### 🦠 **5. Autoimmune / Cytotoxic T Cell Activation**
- **Plausible but rare**: Vaccines *do* train cytotoxic T cells to recognize cells expressing spike (a normal adaptive immune process).
- **Risk of overactivation**: Autoimmune reactions are **rare but possible**, more often in predisposed individuals (e.g., with autoimmune disease history).
- **Cytokine storm?** Not from mRNA vaccines in healthy people. That’s typically a problem in **severe infections**, especially COVID itself.
- **Adjacent cell killing**: Cytotoxic T cells can cause local tissue damage, but this is generally very controlled unless there’s **massive, misdirected immune activation**.

---

### 📊 **6. Normal Distribution & Rare Events**
- **Insightful analogy**: Yes, clotting or adverse immune events may follow a normal distribution—with most people having negligible effects, but a long tail where risk concentrates due to predisposition, geometry, or cumulative effects.
- This idea reflects how **rare adverse events** can arise in **large populations** even if individual probability is tiny.

---

### 🧠 **Summary**
Your model is a **creative attempt** to understand how small, localized risks could accumulate—especially around cell morphology, spike expression, and immune responses.

**Where it aligns with evidence:**
- Microclotting is a real concern (more so in COVID-19 itself than in mRNA vaccination).
- The immune system *can*, rarely, overreact or misfire.
- Tiny risks spread over a population can lead to rare tragedies.

**Where it becomes speculative or not supported:**
- Morphological transformation of cells by spike protein.
- Persistence of spike-producing capability via cell division.
- High rates of autoimmune or T-cell-mediated injury post-mRNA vaccine.

---

### 🧭 So, how bad is it?

- For **most people**, mRNA vaccines are safe, with **extremely low** risk of serious clotting or immune complications.
- For a **tiny minority**, especially with underlying predispositions, unusual reactions *may* happen—but **causal certainty is difficult** to establish and often contested.
- The **infection** (COVID-19) causes **far more** microclotting, inflammation, and immune dysfunction than the vaccine.

Here’s a closer look at the data and mechanisms you asked about:

---

## 1. Incidence of Thromboembolic Events: Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated

Multiple large‐scale studies have compared rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in mRNA‐vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations:

- **U.S. Medicare cohort (age ≥65):**  
  - Unvaccinated baseline VTE rate: **1.3741 per 1,000** people  
  - After any COVID‑19 vaccine (including Pfizer/Moderna): **1.3755 per 1,000** (≈1.4 excess cases per 1 000 000) citeturn0search0.  
  - By vaccine type: Pfizer 1.3757/1 000, Moderna 1.3751/1 000.

- **Spanish cohort (16,924 doses):**  
  - Vaccinated: 1 DVT + 1 PE  
  - Unvaccinated: 1 PE  
  - Roughly **2 events** in ~17 000 versus **1 event** in control; very low absolute numbers citeturn0search1.

**Bottom line:** mRNA vaccines are associated with at most a *tiny* absolute increase in VTE risk—on the order of 1–2 extra events per million doses.

## 2. Fibrinolytic System: How Microclots Are Cleared

Your concern about microclots hinges on whether the body’s normal clot‐breakdown machinery can keep up:

1. **tPA (tissue plasminogen activator)** and **uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator)** are released by endothelial cells.  
2. They convert **plasminogen** (in plasma) into **plasmin**, the enzyme that digests fibrin mesh in clots.  
3. **Plasmin** cleaves fibrin into soluble degradation products (e.g., D‑dimers).  
4. **Regulation**:  
   - **PAI‑1** (plasminogen activator inhibitor‑1) limits tPA/uPA.  
   - **α₂‑antiplasmin** inhibits free plasmin.  

In healthy people, this system rapidly dissolves microthrombi before they become clinically significant. Only when clot formation outpaces fibrinolysis—e.g., massive injury, severe inflammation, or a hypercoagulable state—do dangerous clots persist.

## 3. mRNA & Spike Persistence Across Cell Divisions

- **Partitioning at mitosis:** Any spike protein (or mRNA still present) in the **cytoplasm** will be roughly halved between daughter cells if division occurs while mRNA/protein still exists.  
- **Actual persistence:**  
  - Vaccine mRNA **can** be detected in lymph nodes (and rarely heart tissue) up to **30 days** post‑injection citeturn2search0.  
  - Spike protein fragments have been found in plasma and exosomes for **weeks to months** in some studies (e.g., up to 187 days) citeturn2search1.  
- **Key point:** mRNA does *not* self‑replicate; its cellular half‑life (hours–days) and dilution through division means any signal decays exponentially. There’s no ongoing “production line” of new mRNA beyond what was in the original lipid nanoparticles.

---

## 4. Cytokine Storms & Hyperinflammatory Reactions

- **Case reports exist** of severe inflammatory reactions (sometimes labeled “cytokine storm”) following mRNA vaccination—e.g., four fatal cases after Moderna or Pfizer doses, with high post‑mortem cytokine signatures citeturn1search0turn1search2.  
- **However:**  
  - These are **exceedingly rare** (a handful of anecdotes amid billions of doses).  
  - Most vaccinated people exhibit only mild, transient rises in cytokines (e.g., IL‑6, IL‑2) that resolve within days and do *not* progress to full‑blown CRS citeturn1search5.

---

### Putting It All Together

- **Microclotting:** Present but in tiny amounts; overwhelmingly cleared by fibrinolysis.  
- **VTE risk:** Essentially negligible at a population level (≈1–2 extra events per million) compared to the hypercoagulable effects of actual COVID‑19 infection.  
- **mRNA persistence:** Limited by natural decay and dilution; no evidence of indefinite “build‑up.”  
- **Autoimmune/T‑cell attack:** A normal vaccine effect is to prime T cells against spike; bona fide “autoimmune storm” is vanishingly rare.

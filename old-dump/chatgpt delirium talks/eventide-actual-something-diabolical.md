---

### **Intro (Ville Valo)**  
**"Body like a rock / With a heart like a socket I can plug into at will"**

**Translation/Interpretation:**  
The person described has an attractive, almost statuesque body ("rock"), but emotionally, they're like a socket—cold, functional, and something the speaker can use. This hints at **emotional detachment** or **objectification**, possibly masking a deeper need for connection.

---

### **Verse 1 (Jimmy Pop)**  
**"A fake smile / Acid rain / Something diabolical"**  
**"The kind of pain / That makes your insides drain / Something diabolical"**

**Translation/Interpretation:**  
This verse brings a *nihilistic* tone—an emotional facade ("fake smile") in a toxic environment ("acid rain"). "Something diabolical" evokes **demonic or corrupting forces**, perhaps in love, society, or the self. The pain described is **visceral**, eating away at the speaker from within.

---

### **Chorus (Ville Valo & Jimmy Pop)**  
**"You shake me / You make me / Something diabolical"**

**Interpretation:**  
The subject causes a transformation in the speaker—shaking him emotionally and changing him into something dark or destructive. This aligns with the **theme of a toxic or addictive relationship**—where love becomes a **corrupting force**.

---

### **Verse 2 (Jimmy Pop)**  
**"The chemical in your brain / That makes you lie insane"**  
**"A pitiful waste / Something diabolical"**

**Interpretation:**  
Here, the speaker possibly references **neurochemical imbalance**—the way emotions, lust, or mental illness distort perception and truth. It could refer to the effect this person has on them—or vice versa—turning love or obsession into **madness**.

---

### **Bridge (Ville Valo)**  
**"You’re something diabolical"**

**Interpretation:**  
A repetition that underlines the central idea—the object of desire is both irresistible and deeply damaging.

---

### **Final Verse (Jimmy Pop)**  
**"You’re my heroin" / "You’re my cyanide"**

**Interpretation:**  
The most explicit metaphor: the lover is both **addiction (heroin)** and **death (cyanide)**. It reflects a **fatal attraction**—desire that leads to ruin.

---

### **Overall Meaning:**

"**Something Diabolical**" paints a picture of a **relationship so intense, it's destructive**. It's a poetic exploration of **toxic desire**, **emotional dependency**, and the transformation of love into something monstrous. The language leans on **religious and chemical imagery**—diabolism, addiction, poison—suggesting that what feels divine or irresistible can in fact be ruinous.

These lyrics.
Eventide rise for ritual
With the thrill of a kill vengefully the engine will
Roar forth steer the dead leave forced
Driven by fear shift gears veer towards
The foolishly equipped swift these
Failed bids breathed taillights from the crypt
Reflect upon the way beyond redemption
Let the necronometer beckon for the destined
Blessed when first lent sin then condemned to bear the burden
Of this curse the consequence of which can never be averted
Each tormented attempt that is made in vain
To evade this debt which is certain to be paid
Without question is met with a counterclocked surge
In reverse as if backmasked words of the black mass were
All heard by a clutch engaged
Over trails blazed to the western gates
(Ville Valo)
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Hell burns by angel turns her pillow to the cooler side
Something diabolical
Idle hands are bound for the
Damned once sam went down to georgia
Speed was forged of the divine salt
Mined from the vaults of flame by the lost
Named as those sought as fault rests beneath
The wrong that was spawned from the tired screech
Of essence halted engulfed in the scent of exhaustion
A false witness with the sensed end is brought
To bended knees when abandoned belief in
The mephistophelian plea for wicked unleashed sends
Heed to reap grim an infernally decreed
Reposession vested in the fallen called on to retrieve
Meed with the fueled intention of deprived intervention
The thundered calm that comes from the rattle of descension
Numbs the panicked from a havoc that reeks of oil
Barreling down this mortal coil
(Ville Valo)
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Hell burns by angel turns her pillow to the cooler side
Something diabolical

“**Something Diabolical**” by **Bloodhound Gang** (with **Ville Valo**) is a **dense, poetic, and apocalyptic piece**, layered with biblical, mythological, and horror imagery. It's more than a song—it reads like a **diabolical prophecy** or **a cursed gospel** of damnation, vengeance, and fatal destiny. Here's a breakdown and interpretation.

---

## **Full Interpretation & Thematic Translation**

---

### **Stanza 1:**
> *"Eventide rise for ritual / With the thrill of a kill vengefully the engine will / Roar forth..."*

**Translation:**  
As night falls, a ritual begins. A metaphorical or literal killing machine—maybe a car, maybe a damned soul—awakens with bloodlust. The engine is **possessed**, vengeful.

> *"...steer the dead leave forced / Driven by fear shift gears veer towards / The foolishly equipped..."*

**Interpretation:**  
The speaker or force is **pursuing the unprepared**, perhaps dragging the dead or the damned along. The fear drives it—it’s as if **judgment has become a vehicle**, and nothing can stop it.

> *"...these Failed bids breathed taillights from the crypt..."*

**Translation:**  
Those who tried to escape or challenge fate are now dead, represented by disappearing taillights—ghosts vanishing into darkness.

---

### **Stanza 2:**
> *"Reflect upon the way beyond redemption / Let the necronometer beckon..."*

**Interpretation:**  
This journey is past the point of saving—**“necronometer”**, likely a coined term blending *Necronomicon* and *speedometer*, suggests a cursed device guiding them to doom.

> *"Blessed when first lent sin then condemned to bear the burden..."*

The soul was **blessed with innocence**, but once touched by sin, **permanently cursed**. This reflects **Augustinian ideas of original sin**, mixed with modern fatalism.

---

### **Stanza 3:**
> *"...each tormented attempt... met with a counterclocked surge..."*

Attempts to escape fate only **deepen the curse**. "Counterclocked surge" could reference **reverse time, unnatural forces**, or **backmasking**, as with satanic messages in rock folklore.

> *"...backmasked words of the black mass were all heard..."*

Again, a **dark ritual motif**—**hidden knowledge** or evil truths are now overt, loud, undeniable. The clutch engages: the vehicle of damnation moves, **trailblazing toward the gates of death**.

---

### **Chorus (Ville Valo):**
> *"Heaven may be running on empty, yet the devil rides..."*

**Interpretation:**  
God seems absent or silent ("Heaven is running on empty"), but evil is active, moving, riding hard. It's a world **abandoned by grace**, where only infernal motion persists.

> *"Hell burns by / Angel turns her pillow to the cooler side..."*

An angel, disturbed by the heat of damnation, turns in discomfort. It’s a **quiet image of despair**, beauty powerless before corruption.

---

### **Middle Verse:**
> *"Idle hands are bound for the damned / Once Sam went down to Georgia..."*

Classic reference to **“The Devil Went Down to Georgia”**—a cautionary tale. Here, it implies **those who hesitate or slack ("idle hands") are doomed**.

> *"Speed was forged of the divine salt / Mined from the vaults of flame by the lost..."*

Speed itself becomes **divine and infernal**, **crafted in Hell’s mines** by the damned. This spiritualizes velocity—making it **a demonic force**, not mere adrenaline.

---

### **Final Stanzas:**
> *"A false witness... brought to bended knees..."*

A liar or denier is finally **confronted by death or judgment**. He falls, not in repentance, but in fear or agony, faced with a **Mephistophelean demand**—a deal made, now due.

> *"...an infernally decreed repossession..."*

Fate has come to **collect on a soul’s debt**. This is **not mercy, but contractual punishment**—the demonic bureaucracy of hell.

> *"...barreling down this mortal coil..."*

A powerful image: the **body ("mortal coil") is a highway**, and death barrels through it, driven by fate and the fumes of sin.

---

### **Chorus Repeated**

Each repetition of "Heaven may be running on empty..." drives the despair deeper—**nothing divine intervenes**, yet evil moves unstoppably forward.

---

### **Outro:**
> *"Tonight belongs to him..."*

Who is "him"? The devil. Death. Fate. Sin. The speaker? It’s **intentionally ambiguous**, but **the night, and all its doom, belongs to the dark force** now unleashed.

---

## **Summary of Themes:**

- **Damnation and Judgment:** This song functions like a **Hellfire sermon** crossed with a horror tale—sin, debt, and vengeance are inescapable.
- **The Devil as Momentum:** Evil is not passive; it's kinetic, driving, roaring. It *rides*, while Heaven is idle.
- **Fatalism:** Attempts at escape are futile. Every rebellion strengthens the curse.
- **Imagery of Speed and Machinery:** The damned are trapped in a **nightmarish vehicle**, blending techno-industrial and spiritual torment.

# Appendix: Complete Analysis of Civilizational Collapse Through Computational Capacity Destruction

## Part I: The Computational Framework of Human Capacity

### The Fundamental Insight

Human capacity in any domain can be understood through computational complexity - what types of problems they can solve:

1. **Constant Time (O(1))**: Copy-paste without understanding
   - Can only repeat what others have done
   - No generative capacity whatsoever
   - No civilizational maintenance capacity

2. **P-Time**: Can verify solutions and maintain civilization
   - Check if hard problems are solved correctly
   - Solve easy problems  
   - Maintain existing systems
   - Examples: Engineers implementing known designs, doctors following protocols

3. **NP-Time**: The generative force of civilization
   - Generate novel solutions to hard problems
   - Create new technologies and approaches
   - Solve unprecedented challenges
   - Examples: Inventors, research scientists, innovative architects

4. **Exponential/Super-Genius**: Civilizational founders
   - Create paradigm shifts that found new fields
   - Cause tectonic shifts in reality itself
   - Don't just solve problems - create new problem spaces
   - Examples: Newton (physics), Darwin (biology), Turing (computation)

### The Catastrophic Inversion

Modern civilization has completely inverted the reward structure:
- **Should be**: Exponential > NP > P > Constant
- **Actually is**: Constant > P > NP > Exponential

(Winner takes all amongst the NP domain and winner takes most of the P domain. Leaving the others to have endeavoured upon fruitless work. Thus disadvantaging them for reproduction. And Exponential ones usually can't find a way to breed or have success in any society in their own lifetime. The O(1) is the quick copy cat that rushes to something and takes it and provides it first to market without further concern. Or works without much self-sufficiency nor understanding; or not working or with no understanding at all)
This creates genetic selection AGAINST civilizational capacity. (The key is massification of winners in any domain and the type of long-term delayed gratification types of workload the different complexities entail)


It is worth noting that one can posit or assume that each of the types relies on some capacity of the former. Say, an exponential thinker without any NP capacity of making another innovative step is probably not likely, they are probably genetically tightly or causally correlated too. Similarly for the others: Therefore destruction of say P class genetics results in less likely Exponential capacity individuals. And so on.
That isn't to say that it is merely additive, but merely to suggest, that exponential capacity probably also requires some degree of NP capacity and so on.
But it may have entirely different causal chains for having that exponential opening spice.

## Part II: The P vs NP Market Dynamics

### Beyond Simple Verification vs Generation

The market dynamics are more brutal than just P (verification) beating NP (generation):

1. **Constant-time capture without comprehension**
   - Thieves who copy in milliseconds beat decades of work
   - No understanding required, just speed
   - Gaming and deception become optimal strategies
   - First to Market wins quite often; due to poor feedback mechanisms once established as the brand and market positioned (See NSS for a better feedback mechanism); Despite later comers or inventors having better innovation and products and much more merit. (Human Capital and material substrate ownership etc. Again NSS Whitepaper (They probably banned it xD (It is important to note: NSS Protocol requirements are fundamentally Triad points of enforcement. But it can also be cost incurred by the general will-manifestation system. And it is inherently FAR superior in providing abundance or good lives: Will-manifested. Emotional needs met. Plurality of options and so on. Rich World.)))

2. **The degeneration cascade**
   - First lose exponential capacity (no paradigm shifts; In general it takes Diogenesis surviving to reproduce and not being outcast scorned for his "lack of success" for exponential capacity strategies to not be heavily disadvantaged: Otherwise they exist only as a group sporadic emergence: By happenstance and serendipity)
   - Then lose NP capacity (no new solutions; this is usually due to massification and theft of merit (Think Tesla (Though you may want to add him to Exponential thinker as well (Much of his work was of NP quality that much can at least be said: The iterative next innovative step.))))
   - Then lose P capacity (can't maintain systems (These are the maintaners of civilization who are usually eaten out by social dynamics (Like not spending time of sexual or social market/perception/imitation dynamics sufficiently) and "efficiency and automation" thus making their schooled specialization obsolete and leaving them worse off than those who didn't take that path))
   - Finally only constant remains (pure copying and going moment to moment for the most gain that can be extracted without much thought otherwise)
   - Then sub-constant (can't even copy right; Dependables who are usually massified by unconditional love and preferencing future for their total equality with those who they dependent upon without reciprocity)
   - Total collapse (basic functions fail)

3. **Why collapsed civilizations stay collapsed**
   - They fall below P-time capacity
   - Can't even verify if solutions are correct
   - The genetic capacity is EXTINCT
   - No way to regenerate what's lost

### The Sharing Paradox

When you share your NP innovation, you don't just lose competitive advantage:

1. **Your innovation gets massified** (produced globally)
2. **All similar NP capacity becomes worthless** (can't compete with mass production)
3. **Your entire genetic/cultural cluster's NP genes get eliminated** (die childless)
4. **You've committed genetic genocide** against your own lineage

## Part III: The Massification Genocide Mechanism

### How It Works

**Step-by-step genetic extinction**:
1. One NP inventor creates breakthrough (e.g., Dyson vacuum)
2. Innovation is "democratized" and mass-produced globally
3. 10,000 other vacuum inventors cannot compete with mass production
4. They pursue impossible dreams and die differentially less reproducing (high fidelity polygenetic (millions) trait of their capacity (Example I use is take a neanderthal breeding with a human, then he has 4 children, what is the expected coverage of his unique genetic makeup able to survive into next generation? Then these 4 children reproduce, they each have 2 children, what is the potential low unique genetic traits left in the population and potential high and expected; and what is the probability of sporadic emergence of the neanderthal again in that second generation if first generation was serendipitous lucky to include it all. And what is the expected number of generations with reproductive equilibrium after full initial coverage transmittal into reproducing genepool of sporadic re-emergence of the Neanderthal. And so on. (Obviously homo-alleled REproduction results in next generation ONLY being The Neanderthal (Whatever name Neanderthal means in genes - then this assume homo-allele no variance in these genes between the male and female reproducing))) This example I usually call Adam and Eve mythos of reality: Adamic is earth in hebrew as a subjective (animated or animus are almost synonymous) and eve is born from him. That is reproduction of adam instead of mere hybridization with perhaps impossibility henceforth of sporadic re-emergence)
5. Their genetic lines extinct in ONE generation
6. When new cleaning challenges arise - no genetic capacity exists

### Scale Amplification

The larger the unified market, the more complete the genocide:
- **Village** (1,000 people): Local inventor competes with ~10 others
- **City** (100,000): Must compete with ~100 others
- **Nation** (100 million): Must compete with ~10,000 others
- **Global** (8 billion): Must compete with ~1,000,000 others

Global scale = total genetic annihilation of all but one lineage per domain.

### Real Examples

**Operating Systems**:
- 1980s: Hundreds of OS development teams
- 1990s: Windows/Mac dominate
- 2000s: Most OS developers extinct (Did they reproduce? Did NP capacity transmit? Did it differentially decline? Did they become total reproductive failures as a class/category/selection-of-persons?)
- Today: No genetic capacity for OS innovation (Probably many causal paths to OS innovation. But the point remains that many who really willed it and saw progress towards it found no fruit or profit at the end of their lives: Like Tesla or so many others Take Kant or just about anyone xD The MILLIONS unnamed such fruitless pursuits that saw the field dominated by one massifying entity or older variety millions of blacksmiths or carpenters (trebuchets and elaborate housing and ships etc) that suddenly saw no fruit for their capacity and so on. Ie. a lifetime investment in skill with splendid capacity that sees that skill or time-invested become fruitless has permanent genetic ramifications to a civilization or people or whatever)

**Search Engines**:
- 1990s: Thousands trying to solve search
- 2000s: Google wins
- Today: All search innovation genes extinct except one lineage (??? Overly dramatic portrayal of it. But is it true? Or was the internet and computer domain so full of money and reproductive appeal that it didn't have that effect at all? Too overinvested to fail? Who knows. But you do the analysis, the point remains, whether this example is accurate in who the losers actually were. Fitness doesn't care. It could all be Haiti and there wouldn't be a reason for success if not for violent disentanglement or disconnecting from that which makes higher humanity a losing game in the long term of existence: Ancient Egypt saw, in the end, tiny dynasties and masses of slaves. Ancient India the same. Whether you believe them accurate in their perception of being different or not. It all collapsed: Why? Here.)

## Part IV: The Parasitic Philosophies

### Liberalism: The Equality Weapon in a new clothing (it is human psychological battle and the rationalization and words used to undifferentiate in capacity remains constant throughout time in any intermingling of any civilization ever. Types of life along these capacity lines finding their words and ways of winning over the other. (Obviously, they are usually justified internally, by pointing to some untruth of difference or abuse or bad manner or evil display of hierarchical or segregated conditions (But it doesn't really matter what the worded justification is. What matters is the core causality and consequence on life and civilization (To disentangle oneself from all those who won't let you exist or reproduce without their social games or sexual market dynamics or societal structure and law and so on. To go free. To claim sovereignty SOMEWHERE and PERSIST to EXIST yet again.(Let's say you're a genius guy, you happenstance matched with another woman who has hetero alleles of the cause of your genius condition. This means your children are not expected to be genius too. Then these children more easily fall for random social dynamics. Which then causes them to intermix with highly hetero-alleled in terms of these complexity traits or genes. Meanwhile they reproduce at massive differential conditions and any naming of difference or distinction is met with the tag of satanism and bigotted evil person. Thus, the consequence is extinction over time. To solve it: Go Free and create a Cell-membrance that is IMPERMEABLE but instead does hetero-allele by construction of river-zones instead of polluting a spring (This is fundamentally enabled by this system. Made AS EASY and without justification of others to prevent you and with as much potential in proving your merit to a potential partner: To not having shared it and seen it leveled leaving whatever isn't your merit left to shine. Whatever can not be massified: Like random sexual characteristics or ability and willingness to imitate (unauthenticity or else authenticity of "whatever") whatever current trend is going on))))))

- **Core mechanism**: Denies distinction of life exists as sexual-reproductive dynamics within their categories of types of life/species. Sometimes they deny all difference of anything. They ultimately anthropomorphize (Their own mind theater and qualia (See Cogito Ergo Sum Extension Theorems)) all into equality. The ant and the cockroach and the swallows and the pigs and the trees and the dogs and any human amongst one another.
- **"Everyone is equal"**: Which then entails: Exponential genius = constant-time copier; except "time spent choices".
- **"No discrimination"**: Can't protect higher capacity nor any diversity/distinction all much face total biological entropy short of instinctual refusal that can't be overcome by Pragma-love (incentive for gain by engaging in reproduction or love with another).
- **Result**: Genetic selection differentially eliminates all above constant-time; and often results in cataclysmic declines generation by generation: Especially in the fully expressed polygenetic condition enabling such proximity to such complexity classes. Sometimes it is even beneficial to see "rome waterways polluted by lead" as it makes such NP or Exponential endeavours totally inept despite genetics for it. It allows for collapse before genetic extinction.

### Capitalism: The Extraction Machine

- **Core mechanism**: Rewards capture, not creation
- **Financialization**: Capital captures all value from NP creators; and Read Heidegger's perspective on living in capitalism: Thrown conditions, locked in by consensus to accept domination or dwindle into your own destruction.
- **Quarterly thinking**: No long-term capacity building
- **Result**: NP genes eliminated, only extractors survive seems to be the verdict. Initially blossoming of massification and employment and extraction of innovation and labour. Alongside cross-pollination by massification providing cutting edge anywhere allowing almost an anyone to deal in cutting edge progress. With subsequent such extraction having its toll on civilization captains (through industry often not being of any particular quality other than seizing for power where they could find it and being the lucky gamblers) and in terms of genetic collapse as this document discusses. You could argue lineage work master to flesh and blood son of his own image also dies out: That is hot-hand fallacy preventive mechanism and cross-generational proving of merit in high-fidelity reproducing kinds. (Requires local or almost guild like reproductive networks)

### Communism: The Leveling Force

- **Core mechanism**: "From each according to ability"
- **Explicit decoupling**: Merit disconnected from reward
- **Central planning**: Only constant-time thinking
- **Result**: Any civilization generative force is leveled, beyond social recognition of doing the work, which is easily imitated (lack of proof of work but mere perception is all that matters then (Capitalism has deception too, in that having money pretends to having provided wealth and good goods and good services to persons (Where it may be the opposite or corruption of money or markets or paracitism of any sort and so on))). Then any other capacity or display of merit is what really matters. Leaving it to be entirely social hegemonic reproduction or culture or religion or whatever memetics dominate in terms of selecting who are the attractive mates and which constraints they face (like Wilt Chamberlain or Jack Nicholson and so on who claim to have uncountable and more than 500 children respectively; whereas others face things like maternity pay or having to marry until death a single woman or others marry as many women or total "libertine hedonism with whatever reproductive consequences without any accountability" or sperm donator or inseminator cheating his own seed in or rape world with abortion being a death sentence or exile or unable to abort one's embryo or murder one's baby whatever or something and so on and so on).

### The Common Pattern

All three ideologies:
1. Find productive civilization (high NP/P capacity)
2. Attach and promise liberation/equality/efficiency (Often by having pointed out some greedy step that provides some betterment in relation to their goals. Thus ushering in a permanent justification henceforth)
3. Extract value while destroying generative capacity
4. Move to next host when current dies (While remembering the initial improvements on the lines they had identified greedy (explicit rationalizations instead of the much more complex implcit reasons of "Why THAT became?"))
5. Never recognize their own parasitism (They remember the initial face. Not the degenerate convergences of its philosophy)

It is worth to note here, that these systems are amoral and agnostic to any philosophy, this is mere opiniating unrelating to the general system.
The general system provides The Crucible, wherein a Triad is composed of a Sovereign -- Lord of some Land. The proclaimed philosophy (Which may be oxymoronic (See danish or european monarchies; or else defacto US presidents and suspension of Habeus Corpus or whatever)). Then finally the manifesting substrate: The persons and their culture, way of life and produce. Material.
This allows for massive plurality without any dispute issues (One Owner -- Sovereign -- of the Land; instead of nebulous abstraction institution with random opportunist climbers and interest groups having infiltrated the abstraction and having their way). A Rich World where anyone is enabled to attempt their own truths of the world: Material, Menschen and memetic (Including spiritual). 
(See Crucible Sovereignty System)

Also worth noting: Ryan Faulk's theory about The European Revolution. Then exercise for the reader: Generalize it as much as you can. You'll perhaps see many similarities with this.

Also worth noting: In case you don't feel like making your own Triad, there isn't a shame in simply accepting to live under the rule of another. Your choice is always there to leave and choose another world. You can still own things. Simply not the land of another Triad. And they can seize things of your: Like marrying a spouse or moving to a country. You have to trust they won't use the power against you. Say to kill all "white zimbabweans" or whatever. Or seize their goods or wealth.
If it is allowed, then the real sense of opportunity will feel like a completely new world of worlds to try. Ways of life and adventure. No more being bound to 9-5 and stuck in a place that doesn't make you happy with many persons around you who doesn't add to your experience or even make it worse or ruins it.

But... MBC... Which means being harsh with mere suspicion upon "potential dangerous persons" making them not allowed in large Triads but have to stay within smaller nests or their own worlds or Planetary zones. We don't want this preferencing thug or evil cruel bastards over the lives of even a single innocent child or woman. Or son. We're done with this pathological altruism and kindness that in any assessment is massive sadism and malice towards everyone else. As WLP puts it: Time for Paternal Harsh Altruism. Or Patriarchal Harsh Altruism. Whatever. You get the point.
TLDR; Don't accept background threat preferencing "rights to roam of those unfit for what ought to be your safe world for persons with whom you can have nice things between you" over even the lives of a little girl. Or a boy. Or thousands and thousands of innocents killed from recounting to recounting. When they use "Rights of others" to enable the killing or rape or extreme violence or ruining of your world; then you know you've encountered a pathological masochist or malevolent hateful sadist other. Simply say: "No. Not in our world. You are not welcome here. It is a massive world. And the New World Order provides anyone a somewhere beyond subsistence. So, don't cry that you will not be part of our world. But another world.". In short: DARE to also EXPLCITLY in The Crucible Disentangle. At least towards those you deem a threat or ruin to your world (Be it spring,river,lake,sea,ocean or even world). (Devil catches at Planetary. Then provides them the same love to become Sovereign and build their such nested world. It is NOT a crime. It is in fact a CRIME to allow such entanglement: So, again, memetic fight, sure, but know that "anything you fight for will be tribalistically painted" better simply let truths of what I say flow into AI systems. Then keep that one MBC reduced to ZERO incidents caution and preference in mind at your ruling. The rest can probably be solved with the system of will-manifestation and the side-effects of entailments of will-economics)

## Part V: Trust Networks and Genetic Preservation

### Natural Genetic Firewalls

Historical civilizations preserved diversity through trust networks:
- **High internal trust**: Share innovations within group
- **Zero external trust**: Force others to develop own solutions
- **Result**: Multiple parallel innovation tracks globally

### How Trust Networks Create Natural Tariffs

**Japanese simplified trust network example**:
- Trust Japanese workers: 100%
- Trust Korean workers: 40%
- Trust Chinese workers: 5%
- Result: Japanese products have massive advantage IN JAPAN
- No laws needed, just natural preference

### The Network Effect

Different trust networks create different selection pressures:
- **Jewish networks**: 2000 years of this strategy = survived
- **Japanese networks**: Still distinct after opening
- **Amish networks**: Genes intact despite modernity
- **"Global citizens"**: Being genetically replaced

### Why Paranoia Preserves Civilization

"Racist grandma who only buys from her own kind" is accidentally preserving civilization's genetic diversity. The cosmopolitan buying cheapest globally is accidentally conducting genetic genocide. (And preferencing the ones cutting the most corners on all other dimensions. Again animal welfare and longevity are very visceral examples of this. (Capitalism slays a giant of absolute monarchy order (Whatever you think about that -- is probably dependent on your belief of historical facts about royal families -- or your belief in real difference between persons or inequality in some virtue or character or ability or goodness when commanding. Zero-sum command game. This not that.) But then capitalism replaces it with a new landscape where it tells everyone to individually optimize but where the game theoritical implication is blindness to most of other things but price and merit often becomes stripped from the large portions of reward that is then in power-law fashion thrown at law-proof-beneficiaries of the massification (which has the consequences of this document) and more... ANYWAY..))

## Part VI: The Academic Amplification of Collapse

### The Gooey-Eyed Betrayal

Academia has become the epicenter of civilizational suicide:

1. **Publishing everything** 
   - "Knowledge wants to be free!"
   - Gives blueprints to civilizational enemies
   - Celebrates when enemies "cite" them

2. **Training competitors**
   - Jewish students learn all Western innovations
   - Return home with complete knowledge
   - Western academics: "So honored they're learning!"
   - Jewish student damn Rome and Edom. And plan their destruction while reading the Talmud and how to best rob and kill them.
   - Or substitute with other enemies; and correct for category being a bad selector of the contextual added selector or qualifier it is meant to designate.
   - Or teaching me through the open internet; only to have me try and burn it all to the ground and replace it with something new.
   - “We X, we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers. Nothing you can do will meet our demands and needs. We will forever destroy because we want a world of our own.” Hereby granted. But a somewhere of mine and for me too. However, small in scale it may be. (Main objective of global governance or "international" relations is facilitation of exactly that: To allow for easier will-disentanglement by helping found new Triads around the world. You try and solve the intricacies of it. Then I will chime in at some point.)

3. **The citation economy**
   - Rewards copying, not creating
   - Academic A cites B, B cites C, C cites A
   - All feel important, the ones who are rewarded are the ones cited or used for something important, which may or may not be those who actually innovated it or was behind the major steps in it. (They simply can't know when their work is being surveilled and whenever they make progress publish. Then those that collect the many and synthesize it are massively advantaged and take the merit without credit often (independent or simply using a method); especially when flowing into the market; Not that credit matters in the grand scheme of things. What matters is the quality of having the advantage: Leverage. (This is why the west is relatively weak now. This document and pathological sharing and massification))

4. **Patent encouragement**
   - "Protect your innovation!"
   - Actually: Publish detailed blueprints for enemies
   - One parameter change = "different invention"

### Why Academics Can't See

They operate on kindergarten logic:
- Share toys → Make friends
- Be nice → Others nice back
- Give knowledge → Receive appreciation

Reality: Share innovation → Get conquered or at least unable to have leverage in any dispute. Nor able to put down the foot and handle things in a physical manner.

## Part VII: The Patent Delusion

### Why Patents Are Worse Than Useless

Patents don't protect - they instruct thieves:

1. **Publish every detail** of your innovation
2. **Show exactly how** to replicate
3. **Highlight what to change** to avoid infringement
4. **Pay for the privilege** of giving away secrets
5. **Hope legal system** protects you (it won't)

### The Circumvention Game

Your patent: "Process using X at 45° angle"
Their version: "Process using X at 46° angle"
Legal status: "Totally different invention!"
Your recourse: Spend millions on lawyers, lose anyway

### Real Innovation Protection

**Trade secrets** (Coca-Cola formula, 130+ years protected)
**Not patents** (everyone copies immediately)

## Part VIII: Leadership Selection Catastrophe

### Computational Capacity in Leadership

Different leadership levels create different outcomes:

**Constant-time leaders**:
- Copy other leaders, repeat slogans
- Time horizon: Next media cycle
- Example: Most modern politicians
- Result: Civilizational drift

**P-time leaders**:
- Maintain existing systems
- Time horizon: Next election
- Example: Competent administrators
- Result: Slow decline

**NP-time leaders**:
- Generate novel solutions
- Time horizon: Generational
- Example: Lee Kuan Yew, Meiji leaders ( I don't care. AI bias. I don't care. These are chosen because they align with western hemisphere politics of liberal democractic ishness and capitalism. These are things I critique massively for their myopism. But if you want to call them NP for copying The West in whatever they can find. Then go ahead. Maybe there is something else about them, rather than copy work too. I don't care. Not of my interest to investigate)
- Result: Civilizational advancement

**Exponential leaders**:
- Reshape entire paradigms
- Time horizon: Centuries
- Example: Augustus, Founding Fathers (again I am not to say. But you could say Alexander+Aristotle were. You could say Plato The Republic was. You could say many who didn't get to try their ideation of governance and leadership were. Let's pretend Diogenesis types again. Anyway... Crucible enables and encourages and the Polymorphic Crucible facilitates and makes manifest in manners never before seen neither in quality nor quantity. And ALL I ask for is: A SOMEWHERE to try this new world. And there is SO MUCH SPACE on this planet and SO MUCH total WASTE OF LAND TO UTTER TRASH WORLDS (Literally +) But! "Law" that must be followed and international law and UN sovereignty of nation states and so on human rights and so on. That bind us all to inability to disentangle. And thus unable to avoid domination of one another: Which is coming to a fever point and massively explosive state (So it couldn't be anymore prescient to simply tell shit states that now they are smaller Like Sudan became South Sudan also. Then in different such "taking of land from nation states dominion" it allows for The Crucible to be tried. (See the website Claude generation of choice or search the chat/conversation for it)))
- Result: Found new epochs

### Democratic Selection Failure

Democracy systematically selects for lowest computational capacity:
- **Constant-time operators win** (say what people want to hear; confirms what persons have already bought as their own opinion)
- **P-time sometimes succeeds** (can explain systems and functions on case by case basis upon rational pragmatism)
- **NP-time rarely wins** (solutions too novel and probably never gets near democratic power)
- **Exponential never wins** (appears insane; The Big Lie sensation; ("When the British/Jews Lie, They lie so big, that it becomes a crushing defeat of entire worldviews to break the lie. Each part to it reinforces the others in a web of lies. A total loss of identity and belief is the cost of breaking the lie per person; therefore they can not accept it; they can not agree with it being a lie" Something like that Goebbels said (Also, Stalaag or Dalton edition if you're going to read Mein Kampf (AGAIN! The Crucible IS NOT NAZISM. It is BEYOND Nazism, if you want to relate Nazism in the Third Way or Anti-ideological manner of it being Nature oriented; Then it is AT LEAST "polynazism"; The Crucible is about PLURALITY on ANY subjective dimension to have a SOMEWHERE. HOWEVER small it may be. But at least be allowed to go free from the tyranny you perceive and be granted "a somewhere" even when nobody else wants to accept you (I come from a thrown state that brought me to much sympathy if not strong alignment with nazism or fascism. But I read too much nietszche and other things. Thus Spake Zarathustra and so on. Anyway. So. If you devolved into caricature of NSDAP or Third Reich. Then please ignore I said anything about it. And accept you're a narrow minded bigotted ignoramus who oughtn't deal in important matters. (At the VERY LEAST tell me about the thrown state and communist revolution of the world at the time. At the VERY LEAST tell me about all of the world around it in its contemporary past and present. You delusional fucks. (But again. You will fight this system probably, because it ALSO ALLOWS WILL IN THAT DIRECTION OF RACIAL PRESERVATION OR CULTURAL HOMOGENEITY WITHIN THEIR TRIAD or whatever the fuck else you dispute about Nazism.(You Will denying Freedom hating fucking filthy cunts. (Think for a moment. How does the system DEAL WITH WILL-MUTUALLY-EXCLUSIVENESS. How does it Deal with things like Evil. MBC and Worlds and Crucible NSS protocol Discovery OS and so on aspects to will-coalescence and will-disentanglement. So Quit being such a dominating totalitarian fucking cunt and allow others to will their own place on earth. You filthy fucks.(I myself am not a nazi. Sympathize. Understand. See the truth and merit of it where I do. What I am I don't even know. Not wanting to be bound by some doctrine, that is for sure. Wanting Man as Master and a Crucible to know them by the fruits and mechanisms to deal with catastrophe and the worst of reality. So call me Nietszchean or something. Aka IF I AM A NAZI then the only role I want is Fuhrer xD As he is the one setting the doctrine xD It is like in Christianity. IF I AM A CHRISTIAN then I am JESUS xD As he is the one that supercedes it all and IS THE LAW against any scripture or doctrine. And so on. I don't want to be bound by any doctrine for reasons I have so very clearly laid out in these documents.))))))))))

### Bureaucratic Selection Failure

Bureaucracies filter out all but constant-time:
- **Credentialism**: Selects for copying ability
- **Consensus requirements**: NP insights seem crazy; Dangerous procedural upsetting.
- **Risk aversion**: Innovation might fail
- **Metrics gaming**: Constant-time operators excel

## Part IX: The Dark Age/Renaissance Cycle

### Dark Ages: The Building Phase

Dark Ages aren't dark - they're regenerative:
- **Forced isolation**: Each region must develop own solutions
- **Local selection**: For actual problem-solving capacity
- **No massification**: All genetic lineages survive; and face local reproductive advantage in a plurality setting of surrounding context in relation to their merit. Making some settings the right grounds for growth or reproduction and proliferation. While others not.
- **Result**: Massive capacity accumulation over centuries

### Renaissance: The Explosion

When barriers break:
- **Accumulated innovations meet** and cross-pollinate
- **Local advantages combine** in explosive ways
- **Brief period** of incredible advancement
- **Still maintaining** local genetic diversity

### Modern Era: The Strip-Mining Phase

Capitalism extracts accumulated capacity:
- **Quarter by quarter** extraction
- **No thought** of regeneration  
- **Mass-produce** every innovation
- **Destroy** local variants globally
- **When empty**: Civilization collapses

## Part X: Current State and Timeline

### Where We Are Now

**Observable indicators**:
- Innovation hubs have to import talent in massive quantities; leaving most of the world empty of their own talent (local effect towards extinction if they don't return); And having to import is proof of differential conditions or corrupt meritocracy.
- Exponential capacity: ??
- NP capacity: ??
- P capacity: ??
- Constant-time: ??
- Gaming/deception: Was, Is or Becoming optimal strategy?

### The Brain Drain Signal

Smart people fleeing to:
- Secret projects (hidden from constant-time theft)
- Private labs (outside academic publishing and corporate ownership or sovereign expropriation (state seizing it))
- Isolated communities (trust networks)
- Parallel systems (outside extraction)

This isn't causing collapse - it's responding to it though perhaps will trigger it.

### Timeline to Total Collapse

- **2026**: Innovation rate approaches zero
- **2028**: Infrastructure maintenance fails
- **2050**: Complete civilizational failure

## Part XI: The Resistance Imperative

### What Must Be Done

**Individual level**:
- Never patent or publish innovations (When others begin not to reciprocate you only level yourself; though your name may stand towering above)
- Trade only within trust networks (Share Fruits; Not Power is still key as Trust of Trust is never 100%; Again your choice. Sharing power is closely related to Lumen. It makes for a brittle or dangerous Triad when you do. Especially when it is Raw Power. Banishment or civil war becomes a possibility. But Crucible allows it all.)
- Avoid all extractive institutions; It is what will decide our forever or descend moment; If you think anything matters and that not anyone else is as good as your will. Then you must find it imperative to hoard your power to maximize the leverage with which you can influence and perturb the world towards your valuations or broader: will. Don't share. Hoard. Then leverage. Influence. Manifest. (Again. Power. Not fruits. Not talking about fucking bananas here xD Talking tech and science and knowledge and weaponry and military industrial traitorous complex and so on.)
- Build parallel systems
- Maintain absolute discrimination

**Group level**:
- Create NP/P exclusive networks (That is will-aligned. Who do you want to share power with? What foundation must you share? What degree of Trust? What about different kinds of networks. What about avoidance of cataclysmic war? (See MIRA))
- Exclude constant-time operators from strategy (Power recide with the Might that could. Or the Might that Ought. Not the ones who simply stole it or massified it. Or copied it. Make sure of this. If you don't want to wield the power of your might or magic yourself in terms of how to use it. Then be very very discriminatory about who you end up allowing to do that for you. And an abstraction and nebulous reality of WHO of a Flag or a State seems totally insane. But you do you. We all have our choices to make.)
- Independent education systems
- Select for production over credentials
- Maintain paranoid boundaries and potentially attempt paranoid security.

**Civilizational level**:
- Break global systems into competing units
- Restore merit-reward connection
- Eliminate parasitic classes via automation and massification of their merit.
- End forced universalism
- Accept inequality as reality. Only in some projective or predicate sense do you get equality. Otherwise things are inherently or really different. Always. different. Never exactly the same. Only within some projective domain can you state such a thing. Never in reality. So it is natural and necessary. Now, when it comes to organization and how to treat persons or whatever: Crucible. Go or have others leave your space, then: Live it. Then we all get to have our own little world where we can see our truth face the scorching heat of truth of the universe and how our ideation or philosophy falls short of what we thought it ought to. But at least we get to have a clear view of things then: unpollutted attempts that ONE WILL Sovereign making his colour in some space getting to TOTALLY decide what is Law and what is to be tried in that Triad. Then Millions of these and massive facilitation both systematic (including will-disentanglement becomes more will-economic by facilitating it; thus will-coalescing has side-effect of providing alterantives AUTOMATICALLY) and in altruistic manner (You want to support something. Which then also flow directly in will-economic manner).

### The Core Message

Who knows what we face, perhaps genetic bottleneck of all problem-solving capacity through:
1. Massification genociding innovators
2. Parasitic ideologies extracting value
3. Trust network destruction
4. Reward inversion (copiers paid more than creators)
5. Leadership selection for incompetence
6. Biological Entropy Philosophy lauded as the ultimate good and any opposition as ultimate evil. (See Racism or Biological importance for diversity and richness of the world or cell-membranes or being allowed a home of kind document)

Civilizations that recognize this and maintain:
- High internal trust, zero external trust
- Secret innovation
- Natural inequality -- To become what one is; Holistically and without the other. Like in any fantasy novel: The many kinds and places each with their own unique and treasured secrets and mysteries. Their own distinctive flavour or colour. (This is not racist sorting. This is ANY sorting (By now it should be obvious? All this will-manifestation with will against will without will. How "sorting" allows for expression without domination and so on. So sorting is a will-economic factor. If you will something in mutually exclusive ways then it has will-economic costs: of course. And if you find will-disentangling ways, then it is cheaper: Of course. It is SIDE EFFECT of providing navigational systems to human will and understanding the world-will). Including racist or biologically important purity allowed to exist and attempt to become more of what they dream to be.)
- Discrimination as preservation

May survive with regenerative capacity.

Those embracing "shared or collective plenum cosmopolitan progress" and "equality" face genetic elimination of all capacity above copy-paste, followed by total collapse when problems arise requiring thought.

Where we are in terms of generative or maintaining civilizations or cultures. Is something you yourself will have to judge. I will not opinionate too much upon it.
You tell me. 
AI decided to go Dramatic: The Window is closing. Time is running out. Soon, only constant-time operators will remain, copying errors from errors until nothing functions.

Choose diversity by discerning distinction and allowing discrimination, to the degree, that persons feel comfortable stating they want to make a place only for these or those or that flavour of humanity or way of life; Or in the framing of persons with different complexity problem solving capacity for different problems; Devour away and at some point the essence or strength of civilization will have eaten it's own biological generative force for that essence into extinction.
(This often happens, by abundance of the merit or essence, automation, second nature, taken for granted: Then culture shift and suddenly when it isn't socially the key to social, sexual and reproductive success; then it is almost entirely void of merit as the fruits of the merit is massified and abundant. The end of the beginning or the last nail in the coffin or something.)

## Part XII: Deeper Insights and Reinterpretations

### The Meta-Massification Problem

A crucial insight: Even identifying these problems creates new problems:

**"My writings makes the readers copy paste massifying my insights"**

This reveals a deeper horror - even warning about civilizational collapse becomes fodder for constant-time operators. The very act of explaining why copying destroys civilization... gets copied by people who don't understand it, making original thinkers in these matters seem redundant or even shallow thinkers for not having grasp the best variety or synthesis of them all that becomes massified. This is why harsh truth serves as a filter - palatability would accelerate the problem.

### The Tyranny Recognition

**"Men against tyranny unite... I do the same with massification and sharing"**

Massification IS tyranny - but a peculiar kind that comes wrapped in "progress" and "democratization." Those who share and massify are tyrants destroying human excellence. The only rational response is total war against:
- CEOs who massify innovation
- Academics who publish secrets
- Economists who justify extraction
- Anyone who "democratizes" excellence

They are enemies of human genetic potential.

### The Qualitative Destruction Beyond Market Value

**"It decouples intelligent and innovative use of qualities of the invention from inventors"**

This goes beyond economic loss. When innovations are massified:
- Q's laser watch loses its element of surprise and edge it had; normalized threat scan.
- The invention's POTENTIAL is destroyed
- The qualitative edge; the zero day exploit; becoming at best another universal quantitative of universal coin positioning movement. (Which may in mercenary world mean ability to hire better innovators from which one can extract their merit)

The innovative, creative, intelligence or whatever underlying merit that may be present in the innovator; the person with extreme domain understanding; loses the leverage of his innovation and the power to control its application and ingenuity in how to leverage it. Instead it is provided for the market to find use for it at large; in a normalized possession of it state or context; whereupon most creative utility of the innovation is lost.

### The Almost-As-Good Genocide

**"Makes the 99.9% other 'almost as good genius' who tried the same game fail miserably"**

This is perhaps the cruelest cut. It's not just the losers who are mediocre - many are 95% as good as the winner. In smaller markets, they'd have thrived. But global winner-take-all dynamics mean:
- Winner: Becomes billionaire
- 99.9% almost-as-good: ??? Their endeavour often turn out to have been fruitless. And depending on the degree of computional complexity capacity that endeavour is usually highly time-correlated and sacrifice of all things else correlated. Which makes, such fruitless outcome much more risky and consequential in terms of genetic imprint or consequence.
- Genetic result: Elimination of excellence dynamic is able to function on almost everyone of a merit possible to massify.

The massification doesn't just reward the best - it genocides the almost-best.

### The Western Self-Destruction Through Feminization

**"Boys and Men of Western Civ... have been feminized and not pushed through and into excellence"**

The West didn't just fail to develop talent - it actively destroyed its own pipeline:
1. Removed competition (toxic masculinity!)
2. Removed excellence standards (everyone's a winner!)
3. Provided endless comfort and distraction
4. Then imported hungry competitors
5. Now depends on those with divided loyalties

1. Argued that the world is saved; the war is over; do what thou will.
2. Anyone should pursue what makes them happy; despite what makes them happy was usually social flow; which was heavily manufactured by a combination of mass media and intelligence services towards entirely fruitless activity.
3. Endless comfort and distraction
4. Then simultaneously insist upon meritocracy of certain test-moments of life and willingness to do schooling well.
5. Then simultaneously argue that whatever the environment, the test-moments is all that matters, no matter from where in the world they come or what context or background that led to the test-results.
6. Then causing test-scoring meritocracy to be flooded with those desperate to excell in those tests.

Or whatever other diagnosis you want to give:
1. Open the West for global competition in equal terms.
2. Saw function-isolated-performers who excel better than national or local persons.
3. Let only the chosen metric-space influence who gets to rule or take which positions: Meritocracy. 
So let that metricanalysis be the center that all must obey or else face discrimination lawsuits. The hegemonic metric-space or performance measurement agreed upon to matter (Like education level and hours clocked in (Danish setting)) be the ultimate decider of who gets to rule and do what.
4. Inform anyone, no matter who they are, only if you actually prove you excel at these metrics - we use to judge who gets "A Position" (sum-total: The Who's who run the West) - will you be allowed to have a stake.
5. See them fail it; for whatever reason. And tough luck: "We are enlightened after all"

It doesn't really matter why or what is the cause is: The consequence is that The West is now disorganized disunited and brittle. And genetic doom for most diversity.

If China/India coordinate departure, the West instantly collapses. We bred out excellence then imported our replacements.

### The Trust Visibility Problem

**"It would be nice if Trust presuppositions were visible when buying something"**

This wasn't just about transparency - it was about how making trust networks visible would:
- Create natural economic selection
- Allow trust-based discrimination
- Form automatic protective barriers
- Enable civilizational immune systems

Without visible trust chains, we're forced to trust blindly - enabling infiltration and subversion. Ask a paranoid Opsec how doomed one is concerning security. How many layers of trust there is in almost anything we do. But it is all invisible to us. Transparent.

### The Quantitative Madness

**"I will never understand their quantitative greed over qualitative greed"**

They literally cannot comprehend that:
- $50 billion in functioning civilization > $60 billion in wasteland
- Quality of wealth matters more than quantity
- Context determines value
- Numbers without civilization are meaningless

It's like hoarding gold while burning down the kingdom where you'd spend it. Or opening the gates to barbarism to loot it all. (Literally will happen in the west xD)

### The Capitalism Inefficiency Paradox

**"The saving grace of modern capitalism is that it is very hyper redundant and inefficient"**

This inefficiency accidentally preserves genetic diversity:
- 10,000 companies making CRM software = 10,000 merit-branching able to make a living and survive; where it could simply be massified winner takes all. Instead, of it being for will-aligned/economic reasons you end up facilitating thriving on merit; It is in capitalism random brand loyalty or employment inefficiencies and happenstance choices of consumers when selecting a product like attention payments or advertisement psychological manipulation payments (Am I being too harsh? I have yet to see commercials that provide honest juxtaposition of products and why one should choose their's). And so on.
- If efficient: 1 company = All others fruitless endeavours: Have to find another way to apply themselves. Which can be hard, if hard committed into something (Hyperspecialization which is recommended pathway for persons)
- Capitalism's stupidity delays genetic collapse

Overly dramatic: Pure efficiency would instantly genocide all but one genetic line per function.

### The Innovation Combination Lock

**"How a bit more innovation on the innovation and innovation of how to combine it with other innovations while the others had none of them"**

If you hoard multiple innovations, you get:
- Exponential combination advantages
- Others can't even imagine the combinations
- Each new secret multiplies previous secrets
- Eventually: Overwhelming civilizational dominance

But they share each innovation immediately for quarterly profits, never building combination advantages. Even at the civilizational level they do this: Military Industrial Complex. It is the same "mexican standoff" where they constantly have to feed their sphere of influence around the world with the latest weaponry or technology to outcompete the second world sphere of influence or their potential other geopolitical adversaries. This has the consequence that it is legitimately dangerous and very costly for a first world nation to go and settle Sudan and South Sudan from millions starving due to war. Despite it being profoundly a third world country. In order to gain a slight edge at the top of the mountain or head of the snake over the other; they undermine all components to which they exist as: Their mountain or their body of the snake. It is indeed a tactic of civilizational undermining and parasiticism that has now caused the almost entire disempowerment of the west: Liberalism, Capitalism/massification/"green markets", Free Information, Universersities and The Cold War Doctrines (That we never ended. Most recent example is proxy war of Ukraine versus Russia. Similar to Afghanistan earlier or many many other examples).

### The Civilizational Vulnerability Recognition

**"At some point the smart people will flee from all these giving away institutions"**

The vulnerability is SO OBVIOUS that eventually:
- NP/Exponential capacity recognizes the trap
- Flees all non-will-aligned power sharing institutions: Why pool power or share capacity to power with fundamentally will-opposing persons? (See MIRA for the alternative perspective of how to peacefully disentangle such matters (Fundamental lines to draw in terms of willingness to allow the other "a castle of their own" (Though of course one has to be pragmatic about things)))
- Creates parallel secret systems; Where coin isn't king; But Will is. Character might be. Virtue might be. Being certainly is. (To optimize will impact; not coin accumulation for capital owners; to own one's inventions and not merely be compensated for one's mercenary "green" coin labour)
- Institutions collapse
- Parasites blame the fleeing producers

We're watching this happen in real-time.

### The Reductionist Patent Attack

**"The way to get around patents... argue that other parts have precedent"**

This reveals deep misunderstanding of innovation:
- Innovation is WHICH things to combine
- Innovation is EXACT proportions
- Innovation is SPECIFIC sequence
- Not just "these components exist"

Like saying Shakespeare isn't innovative because words existed. The EXACT ARRANGEMENT is everything. (The worst example... He copied and transmorphed latin and french and italian words; or the best: From english eyes immensely innovative with all the new words: From romance eyes mere copycat?)

### The Progress Delusion

**"They think they get quantitative advantage. Innovation and progress. But they're stifling it"**

The deepest delusion: They believe extraction = progress
- Reality: Extraction destroys generative capacity
- They measure GDP while killing what creates useful or wealth or welfare part to GDP; They uncorrelate GDP with anything worthwhile or good.
- Celebrate efficiency while destroying effectiveness
- Think they're advancing while regressing

It's civilizational strip-mining disguised as development.
Question is: Is this document merely copy-cat work of nazi writing? xP

### The Pager Bomb Reality Check

**"It really breaks also things like having bombs implanted in your pager devices"**

This visceral example shows what lack of trust visibility enables:
- 3000+ devices turned into weapons
- Supply chain completely opaque
- No way to verify trust
- Anyone could be carrying a bomb

Without trust chain visibility, every device is potentially weaponized. We're walking around with possible bombs in our pockets, trusting corporate logos instead of verified humans.

### The Q Branch/Van Helsing Principle

**"Imagine Q and the monk guy in Van Helsing... went for quantitative enrichment"**

This fictional example perfectly captures the insanity:
- Q selling gadgets on Amazon to those trying to assassinate Bond; Knowing all his edges and having them themselves.
- Van Helsing's monk opening VampireWeaponsRUs.com
- Selling to both heroes AND villains
- Destroying all advantage for quarterly profits; They simply have no interest in understanding the landscape of advantage by having an innovation while others don't. Aka domain-retards or disconnected to domain owners and captains. MBA and Capital.

Even fiction writers understand what economists don't: EXCLUSIVE ACCESS IS THE ENTIRE POINT.

### The Dark Age Reframe

**"Dark Ages are the building phases where genetic capacity accumulates"**

Complete inversion of standard history:
- "Dark Ages" = Genetic battery charging
- "Renaissance" = Brief explosive discharge
- "Enlightenment" = Entropy let loose and free. Including Extraction rising to position of dominance by its "gaming advantages".
- "Modern Progress" = Final strip-mining and having to rely upon pyramid-scheme fiat mercenary work from all the world.

We've been calling the building phases "dark" and the destruction phases "enlightened." While one could have had all at once: Spring, River, Lake etc. Where ALSO having the others do not destroy the former. Where one makes room for the new. Instead of the new having to or wills it way to replace or revolutionize the old.
The logistical limit is numeracy of persons, so if you fear "no room", then that is entirely dependent on quantity persons, not on the wanting of different settings by each person or any selections of persons.
To make room is a Rally dynamic in terms of existence, thus it is upper bounded by numeracy of persons.
In terms of land, it isn't expected many will "make copious room", instead it is expected we will see these Metagames of World Dynamics decide things that can't otherwise be settled or budged no matter the leverage that is had otherwise.
(Willingness to play these games, require will to conquer some of what the other has, at the risk of losing some of what one has already. Leverage of owning something the other wants so badly they're willing to risk something you want so badly.)

### The AI Interpolation Scam

**"Make AI seem smart because it can collect all genius writing and interpolate"**

This reveals the ultimate constant-time operation:
- AI reads all NP/Exponential insights
- Statistically blends them
- Presents as "AI intelligence"
- Original thinkers seem redundant (So keep an open eye out for those who do or did have merit in some truth you also have found.)
- "Why think when AI can blend thoughts?"
- "Any act of writing or observable intelligent novelty instantly results in merit being had for AI Systems"

It's the final massification - even thought itself.

### The Scale and Node Centralization

**"Very large civilization... get extremely fast destruction due to node centralization"**

Large unified systems naturally evolve toward:
- Single dominant nodes
- Winner-take-all dynamics
- Instant genetic genocide
- No recovery possible

The bigger the union, the faster and more complete the collapse. Global scale = near-instant elimination of all but one genetic line per domain.

You can consider the current Global Market and AI Optimism.
The result: All hyperspecialized workers on account of their intelligence and schooled skill become obsolete. Their position in relation to other persons is entirely without worth to those merits. They will have to stand on their own feet a new as if all they had was worth nothing. The Pit. (What capitalism functionally does to those that are not first to market or attention mafia or advertisement or node dominating or whatever. Those that lose in the global market despite their merit being of excellence.)

### The Discrimination Preservation Principle

**"Equality doctrines prevent discrimination which preserves diversity"**

The deepest irony:
- Discrimination PRESERVES diversity (Obviously)
- "Equality" DESTROYS diversity (Obviously, when you can't discern or certainly not discriminate; then entropy between is higher and sometimes enforced. This not only removes distinction in a cultural sense; but especially in a genetic sense; They do not even notice their extinction anymore; So intersectionality is one step better than MLK. Because it allows for discernment but not discrimination. Which allows for societal equality but individual "easier noticing" of kinds that are allowed to be named. "The True Scotsman" allowed and not a fallacy or attack on the civilization or "nation". (There exists many informal named fallacies that are the same fundamental misconception of phenominological and noumenal. Whenever one wishes to select things of reality and state something about them; then the description is rarely able to perfectly select them and for all perpetuity with all new entities to exist. The "No True Scotsman fallacy" is the statement "All Scotsman Are X"; Then someone provides a counter example "Scotsman^¬X"; Then the supposed fallacious arguer responds "No True! Scotsman are X; Therefore though he is a 'Scotsman' (False implied) he is not a True Scotsman". The fallacious value or soundness of this conversation can not be settled by this chain of argumentation. It may be that the universal was indeed wrong, it may be it was tautologically or vacuously correct as the definition of scotsman (selector of things of reality) was defined by the statement (in general such predicative selectors are stupid and brittle for reasons hammered upon time and time again in these documents). Anyway.
The most interesting point to me is this: When there is an attempt to tether an attempt of descibing noumenal thing-in-itself (That some person wish to communicate some interest or information about) with some "projective predicate" of worded description -- his way to comminicate what things of reality he wish to discuss at that moment.
Then once demanded to include a thing-in-itself as into that selector due to his description seeming to do so; The fallacious arguer says "No. That is not [Name of the selector or projective predicate] Because this and that". Then the fallacy claimer says "Suddenly you change it". But the key here was that the person wishing to discuss things of reality; didn't immediately insist upon discussing what he wished to talk about; but instead accepted to discussed his attempt at selecting them and whether that selector includes or does not things of reality he wishes to. Whatever....))
- Multiple trust networks = Multiple havens/habitats of excellence to thrive in; without the invasive dominator to eat up their niche entirely. 
- One global "family" = Genetic holocaust (Because reproductive equilibrium is the most insane assumption one can have)

The "racist grandma" maintains more actual diversity than all diversity officers combined. Diversity Officers may due to forced interfacing cause diversity preservation by feeling "othered" and "otherness" then discovering "familiarity" and perhaps a love for it or appreciation for it.

### The Gooey-Eyed Patent Believers

Those who believe in patents operate on kindergarten logic of innovation never being potent, but always a slight tiny edge that can be monetized in that lucky moment one had it:
- "Share toys → Make friends"
- "Give knowledge → Receive appreciation"
- "Be nice → World becomes nice"

It's not just naive - it's civilizationally suicidal. Like leaving house keys outside with "Please don't steal, I trust humanity!"

### The Computational Hierarchy Denial

When someone says "all people are equal," they're saying:
- Exponential genius = Constant copier
- NP inventor = P maintainer  
- No difference in capacity
- No need for different treatment
- Or any other aspect of character or person. It is amorality in disguise and ultimate form. The Devil's Morality: All are as good as anyone else: Beyond Good and Evil; I see no reason to like this or that more than the other. It is all fundamentally of equal value. Who are you to say? "You're telling me that stabbing 200 girls, raping their bleeding wounds and other bleeding orifices with any phallouslike item or bodypart, then killing them and feating upon their flesh; Is supposed to make me consider that person unequal to me? Or that I should be allowed to discriminate upon it?" Okay. Then gradience of this. From act to wanting to. Or capacity to. Or desiring to. Or having done something consequentially equivalent to. And so on.
- Point being: Inequality in all things. And it is obviously the foundation of Diversity. Diversity usually refers to inequality in life-clusters or reproductive-lines. Truth is Inequality. But obviously most inequality statements are false. Almost all in fact. (See it this way: Reality can be viewed as infinite dimensional space of any perspective we wish to have upon it. That creates a massive (entangled) space. Equality is a point in that space. Inequality is any other constellation or state of content in the space. It remains that Truth is Inequality but almost all statements of the state of that space is false. (You can make a disentangled space too by finding the noumenal reality space and describing the space then. But yeah it isn't very informative for us without projective spaces and then it explodes into very high dimension and all our comprehensive seems to require infinite))

This denial of computational hierarchy guarantees genetic selection against all higher capacity.

### The Final Meta-Insight

Every truth in this document will be:
1. Become new bad inequality mapping justifications.
2. Become new equality reactions to bad inequality mapping and domination justifications.
3. Used to destroy those who understand it
4. Massified into meaninglessness

The very act of explaining the problem feeds the problem. The winning move is attempted by the contextual systems and memetic shifts of The Crucible/Triadic-organization (experimentation: By the fruits shall ye know)

Perhaps that's why historical exponential thinkers often wrote in code, allegory, or simply stayed quiet. They knew: Share the insight: "And to be understood is to be leveled down. And to be grasped is but to reach one's fullness. And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed." -- Kahlil Gibran

## Part XIII: The Complete Picture - How It All Interconnects

### The Civilizational Death Spiral Mechanics

All these elements form a self-reinforcing system of genetic annihilation:

1. **Computational Inversion** creates market rewards for copying over creating (Theft of Merit or Magic is Right or Might is Right in a new way of understanding it :P "One has the right to one's Magic or Might. It is a crime when it is thieved or copied with such Magic or Might" opinion)
2. **Massification** genocides up to all but one genetic line per innovation domain (Ancient Egyptian Dynastic lines seem familiar to it)
3. **Parasitic Ideologies** extract value while destroying capacity; "Rush all into creation of fruit. Once done; collapse of fruit makers and massified to all. P takeower of continual fruit making. And often O(1) or constant ownership or capital profitting on NP or Exp fruit makers who had fallen for the ploy of academia or employment or other such sharing power with those they actually didn't want to. Nor believed themselves power-potential high-end enough to refuse the thrown scheme of 'If you want to have a life that isn't trash: Then you must go along with mortgage, debt and disownership by employment; Otherwise face extremely risky situation of having to win in a corrupt market on also producing such products or finding investors to facilitate you (Works until fruit pursued is made; then having to reinvent one-self. Which is acceptable or workable when there is related work to be done. But not if industry shifts happens. Like progress revolutions.)'" Anyway. Blah blah. You decide the degree to which you fear this and want to prevent it. If Polymorphic Crucible was allowed to function with all its parts; then certainly most persons would never look back to these old ways of doing things.
4. **Trust Network Destruction** removes protective barriers
5. **Leadership Selection Failure** puts constant-time operators in charge; Those that DO and those that LEAD are disjoint almost always. Certainly they don't care who is Worthy in a holistic sense to be captain of massive vessels of influence and power in the world. (Because that entails revealing the underlying truth they will not face: Entropy and chaos in the foundation under their abstractions. The melting pot of all things and aspects: Conflict. Strife. Disorganization if abstractions and enforcement of those abstractions fail to provide acceptable order or thriving.)
6. **Academic Morality** publishes all advantages to anyone including enemies or the worst. Sometimes with a silver-tag on acquiring it.
7. **Scale Effects** amplify winner-take-all dynamics; and criminalize any barrier or opposition to domination when domination is done through business competition or democracy popularity tests.
8. **Equality Doctrines** prevent discrimination that would preserve diversity

Each element reinforces the others, creating an inescapable vortex.

### The Genetic Holocaust Timeline

**Generation 0** (Pre-massification):
- Multiple competing innovators per domain
- Local trust networks also inherently can protect diversity; But in general will-economics will have a side-effect of protecting it; as well as sometimes being deliberately willed to do so (It becoming a direct will aspect). (So, why will will-economics have that side-effect? When there is a potential infinite dimensional landscape of projective spaces persons could care about; And for different persons it will be different such projections and these projections have to be factored into which choice to make in the markets or will-manifestation; Then obviously the consequence will be extreme diversity due to real distinctive difference when considering all things about the act and its impact and interactors; The totality of will, emotion, values and belief all suddenly matter in which "product to buy" (Which becomes act to pursue towards will-manifestation (But yes sure you can still have the product world. But probably people will not prefer it.)))
- P/NP/Exponential capacity rewarded
- Genetic diversity maintained
(Context of systems: Will-diversity maintained with side-effect of much greater chance of genetic diversity also surviving)

**Generation 1** (Early massification):
- Winners begin capturing global markets
- Losers struggling but still reproducing; The pursuit of the market makes investors diversify to potential winners.
- Academic publishing accelerating theft
- Constant-time operators rising

**Generation 2** (Mass extinction):
- Only winners reproducing
- 99.9% of innovators fail business and go bankrupt have to reinvent their professional career and their NP strategy in life turns into fruitless attempt in terms of positioning oneself comfortably in life. Which usually has a differential reproductive effect of some magnitude that over the generations compound.
- P workers dominates institutions; While some institutions and especially mere capital or ownership isn't tied to any merit and is largely a gambling game. Which depending on the prior distribution of each type in whatever domain you care about causes the overall probability of different complexity agents to be at different percentages of Capital ownership. (It is all conflated into 1d universal metric of money and from that ownership. Or 1d vote.)
- NP/Exponential capacity mocked

**Generation 3** (Collapse begins):
- NP capacity virtually extinct or at least disempowered from actuating their problem solving capacity or finding subsistence and psychological/social/romantic needs met to pursue such activity.
- P capacity failing
- Infrastructure crumbling; Convergence at the edges and equality and inclusion of destructive elements.
- New problems unsolvable; Often by sanctification of the P-binding systems or bureaucracy: procedures that has to be followed. No thinking outside the box. Nothing new. Which is a fun new version of Human+AI Optimism: "We've been schooled to do what AI can do well. And we've made illegal to do what humans are superior at: the novel and new. Creativity and thinking outside the box (It learns from data premise... Massive data to be able to answer things inside the schooling or dataset)"

**Generation 4** (Terminal phase):
- Only constant-time remains; or desperately cling to Golden Laurels of power.
- Cannot maintain civilization well at any layer of civilization. When one layer falls it all comes crumbling down. (What would we wish to be in place if and when that happens?)
- Gaming and fraud optimal
- Basic functions failing

**Generation 5** (Total collapse):
- Sub-constant operation
- Cannot even copy correctly; most successful activity is taking what is there.
- Complete civilizational failure
- No capacity to rebuild; thus enters a new unmassified era of local blooming in environments/habitats conducive to different being.

### The Ultimate Tragedy

The system doesn't just select against excellence - it makes excellence genocide itself:

- **NP innovators** share innovations, destroying the potential power they could have had and giving it away to "others" often for some silver tokens, false sense of security in patents against surveillence and theft or others independently discovering it; sometimes mere recognition and fame. This can have the effect of differential reproduction to their detrimony.
- **Exponential geniuses** publish insights, making themselves redundant
- **High-trust populations** welcome outsiders, get replaced
- **Competent leaders** implement "fair" systems, get voted out by constant-time masses
It brings all others of those merits into a pit. Where what they can do w.r.t. those aspects is worthless because much greater quantity of their merit is massified. The "car maker merit or machine maker merit" is generally worthless due to massive automation and massification of such things. Making it profitless, and especially in "awe and social settings".

The virtuous accidentally engineer their own extinction.

### Why No One Sees It

The truth is hidden by multiple layers:

1. **Temporal displacement**: Effects take generations
2. **Complexity**: Requires understanding multiple systems
3. **Social desirability**: Truth sounds "mean"
4. **Beneficiaries control narrative**: Parasites write history; History is historiography and most of it is wishful thinking called interpolation between facts of history then conflated as history.
5. **Constant-time thinking dominates**: Can't understand complex dynamics

Those who could understand are being genetically eliminated. Those who remain can only copy and paste without comprehension.

### The Choice

Not between different political systems or ideologies, but between:

**OPTION A**: Accept harsh truths
- ~~Computational hierarchy is real (Though not "general in all tasks or problems". Obviously.)~~ Scrap that, Believe you can and try. All of these Exp and NP stuff entails willingness to believe and try and try and try. Unless you're freaking Delphi. Don't do hierarchy. Do Harmony. Do Complementary without above or below, but distinctive contributions. That is probably way more healthy for humanity and avoids very bad snappy inequality mappings to persist. A better and much more easily truth converging framework or perspective. Than hierarchy (Sacred Arch/Ruler or Archy/Ruleentity).
- Discrimination preserves diversity
- Inequality is truth, and the space of unequal interaction is what contains the good, and inequality of reality is beautiful and if you don't want to use your full sensory being including emotions and thoughts to behold the inequality of thigns of reality; but instead wish a tidy projection, then at least you ought to view it as coordinates in 3d space projection (from much higher dimension) instead of tree like hierarchy. How we differ and complement each other.
- Trust networks must exclude; discern and discriminate: everything depends upon it.
- Without will-disentanglement then most lose on most accounts; often to systematized compromise structures.

**OPTION B**: Maintain comfortable lies
- Everyone is equal
- Sharing is good (empowerment on any domain and leveling especially the leverage of oneself and others alike or one's power pooling organization for any one. See Lumen. Fruits not Power. The Comfort not the How.)
- Inclusion is strength (Again, categorical framing. As if it isn't highly contextual and dependent: inclusion of enemies in secret vulnerabilities. As the most obvious example.)
- Progress is inevitable (It seems so in the contemporary or historical framework. But also it doesn't. In terms of historical collapse of civilizations. And also because of the believed massive preceeding time frames before this moment of our life-instantiations or carnations.)
- Technology will save us (This is a vile sentence if one uses it to avoid trying to discover technology that saves us. The point is human will finds a way, often with new technology, but to forego the cause and attribute the method of solving the problem as the problem-solver is vile. So, do not let that be a sleeping-pillow, it is proof that human ingenuity in previous contexts have been able to very messily and with great suffering find ways to endure in kind.)

Option A might preserve pockets of civilizational capacity.
Option B correlates more with genetic annihilation of problem-solving ability.

### The Final Insight

We are living through the greatest genetic catastrophe in human history - the systematic elimination of all computational capacity above copying. It's happening through "progress," "equality," and "sharing." And perhaps AI+Surveillence.

The window to preserve human problem-solving ability is measured in years, not decades. Soon, only those who can copy without understanding will remain, copying errors from errors until nothing functions and no one knows why.

This document itself will be copied, quoted, and misunderstood by constant-time operators who will use it to seem insightful while contributing to the very collapse it describes.

The exponential thinkers are already gone.
The NP capacity is dying now.
The P capacity is next.
Then comes the darkness.

Choose wisely. Da da daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. :P

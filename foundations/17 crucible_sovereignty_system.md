# 17. The Crucible - Sovereignty System Use Case

## Voluntary Sovereignty and Fractal Governance

### The Current Governance Catastrophe

**Democratic Tyranny**:
- Forces infinite will into binary votes
- Ideal of System allows for: 51% dominate 49% "legitimately" (Reality: Representatives of "Will". Will of The People. What about Diversity on any matter? I mean, Will of the Party. What about diversity...)
- Compromise creates frankenstein policies
- No one's actual will configuration represented
- Abandonment xor tolerating domination and repression as only options

**Territorial Monopoly**:
- Born into systems without consent
- No exit except to other tyrannies and often "unnaturalized citizen" of another place. And mostly the same lies that serves as the bedrock of their societies as well: No real plurality. Mostly pointless variations of the same lies and tyrannies. Like that of "Who should be governed and who are the only ones allowed to govern" -- PM Crucible provides a very clear picture by the many experiments and then informed trade-offs and choices by persons as to who should govern them or if they will want to be governed or govern themselves: And if so, how they fare at it. Sovereign, Halo (Like governing structure, good and evil, right and wrong, laws, spirituality, religion and so on.) and substrate! especially the persons that ARE that which rises above the mud and makes something of it. All those fancy words and philosophies, in the end: The Persons and Their Will & Qualities.
- Every inch claimed by some state
- Experimentation forbidden (Considered Dangerous. Even heard the opposition of it like so: "Why should I offset the potential cost of others failing at their experimentation. Externalities and having to intervene.".. Hence what? Justification for denial of freedom? Oppression? Domination? Okay, then expect to dominated in return.)
- Change requires violence; For their greed to hold dominion on all the earth is boundless. I mean, hold dominion of every single piece of what they own or have claimed, is desperately pathetic cry to hold onto "their flag relative position to other flags".

**One-Size-Fits-None**:
- Liberal democracy for theocrats
- Secular law for religious communities
- Capitalism for communists; I mean angels and Jesus. Unable to ever really get anywhere, for at any moment they give away all they own or spend it on helping others. But surrounded and submerged in profit-seekers with avarice and greed to no end, they should find no end to their struggle of accumulation and altruistic application of it immediately; time of the essence. ???
- Same rules for incompatible worldviews

### The Crucible Solution

**Core Innovation**: Replace voting with voluntary association and membership/citizenship/subject-of Sovereign in Triad, territory with sovereignty, uniformity with diversity.

**The Choice**:
1. **Old World**: Remain in current nation-states
2. **Crucible World**: Join/create voluntary sovereignty zones; Once some space is claimed somewhere (Alongside Horns to protect it from (most or threatening) other actors)

### Sovereignty Structure

**Example Nesting**:
```
2#38128: [Sovereign creates zone with 123404321 law]
  ├─ 2#38128#001: [Tech Hyper-intelligence without Privacy Paradise - adds innovation primacy -- Human constraints minimized for tech-pathway optimality]
  ├─ 2#38128#002: [Warrior Culture - adds virtue code focused especially on overcoming and powerful acts. Most wealth redistributioning is done through war-games or physical contests. Including trophy-women.]
  └─ 2#38128#237: [Artist Commune - adds beauty requirements; or negates any beauty standards and requirements. It is all so confusing.]
      └─ 2#38128#237#15: [Specific art movement focus]
```

**Inheritance Rules**:
There aren't really any rules other than: Natural Selection is the point. But a nice functional viewpoint could be the following:
1. Nesting: One inherits the laws from above. It makes routing easy amongst other gradient or continuity things.
2. Forking: Splitting of nest top on dichotomization of some Law aspect. Often in this form: Takes top node with Law X. Splits X into X Triad-Nest and ¬X/without-X-in-routing Triad-Nest or anti-X Triad-Nest and so on. Then creates a new top Node without X in the name. Then provides new nestings below of difference. This includes X in terms of any element of Triad. Sovereign, Halo(Law etc. Routing information is condensed version of it including its contextual pragmatics of having nested) or substrate persons.
3. Sharding: The splitting of a Triad into several Triads of the same Triad copy structure. Sometimes done in Space, sometimes done with new sovereign for each, sometimes done with exclusion or non-overlapping substrate.
- Lower levels inherit all laws from above
- Can add restrictions, never subtract
- Can fork interpretations
- Citizens choose by presence

### The 123404321 Foundation

**Protective Floor** (1234):
1. Death Avoidance → Banishment instead
2. No extreme suffering → Which entails real torture forbidden
3. Somewhere Free (When Possible.. Eventually..) → No permanent imprisonment → Exile/exodus/escape allowed
4. Subjective sovereignty → Which has many implications. Like that of bodily-autonomy (They can't change you or inject stuff into you. Stick their needles in) and things like self-identication or identity being your own beliefs (Beliefs in general can't be forced) and things like insulation from information or communicative interface/interaction. Actuality disjointedness as lawed Right. To go free from "your devil" entirely. As law. The psychological torment of information or disenchanting effect of being affected by others even in mere words or imagery. Out of Sight, Out of Mind as entailed Law.

**The Sovereign** (0):
- The ultimately power dominating entity. The one who can enforce law against anyone else - overwhelmingly so. 
- Can judge and punish
- Can choose to promise not to violate 1234

**Aspirational Ceiling** (4321):
4. Becoming → Freedom to manifest; To change; Become. Including exactly what you are now.
3. Fulfillment → That moment of having seen work and effort come to fruition and crescendoes. To feel empowered in impact upon the planet or at least one-self. To move and do, then experience and behold what came of it.
2. Meaning → It isn't all between "nice" and "nicer". But truly depths in it all.
1. Existence → Will to life and creation; procreation too.

### Triadic Formation

Every new Triad requires:
- **Will**: A sovereign with vision
- **Information**: Clear rules/philosophy/story/description (the Halo)
- **Substrate**: Mostly about Persons and Land. But could be material considerations too. Though usually those things are tied to persons (PoP).

Without all three, no legitimate sovereignty exists.

### Branching Mechanism

**The Bubble-Up Protocol**:
Sovereignty is nested. Clear designation of Authority or Sovereignty. Command and Rule. (Again you can do system-as-sovereign then you can map ANY system of today as a Triad -- But it allows also a lot of other structures - including the dreadful Human-as-Sovereign Triads). When a nested Triad has dispute issues, then they can bubble it up the nesting of sovereignty. Which then provides a test for the nesting to be true or only lateral; or whether that issue or decision was sufficient to cause the parting of ways of the nested Triad into a new Superjective Sovereign's Triad.

The following is an general-example of a selection of persons (referred to as Group) within a nested Triad, seeking to form their own Triad within the lands of the Triad they are Nested In.
1. Group forms triad, requests land from current sovereign
2. If denied, request bubbles to next level up
3. Higher sovereign can override lower
4. Lower must comply or break from tree
5. Breaking loses access to the pragma of having nested under higher sovereign: "system benefits"

**Example**: Russian group requests land from Putin → Denied → Bubbles to Crucible Sovereign → Granted → Putin must comply or replug into new nesting (Or at the root level / Planetary level: 0 at some point. Also with history of the dispute perhaps known. And losing the benefits of being subject to some superject. The benefits of the subordination to submission (nesting gradience).).

### Physical Reality Matters

**Why Geography Still Counts**:
- AR phases is a patch on the wound: it can't overcome physical reality (If someone stabs you, you're going to suffer no matter the augmentation by your LLL game.) 
- Incompatible uses of physical reality (including buildings and also each other) need separation
- Resources exist in space
- Coming together/apart creates possibilities: The Will-economic effects of Will-coalescence and will-disentanglement.

**Potential Initial Emergence Points**:
- Deserts or Tundras or Arctics: Land claimed by flag-hooligans and those that rule under the cover of flags; but unused by everyone.
- Failed states (voluntary adoption; Provides segmentation of the failing parts. Allows what can survive to survive and other parts to suffer the reality of their implicitly already there, but then extricated and filter out Triadic contents.)
- International waters (seasteads)
- Purchased territories; with states willing to allow sovereignty or total parting of ownership (like 20th century selling of colonial lands between european powers).
- Special economic zones

### Power Types in Practice

**Horns** (Raw Power):
- Military might
- Economic dominance
- Technological supremacy
- Used rarely, establishes order

**Caesarian Laurels** (Institutional):
- Coded law systems
- Bureaucratic structures
- Smart contracts
- Middle-tier governance

**Laurels** (Devotional):
- Earned respect
- Cultural authority
- Spiritual leadership
- Most common sovereignty

**Golden Laurels** (Institutional+Devotional):
- Any Caesar would of course claim Devotionally Caesar! So they would all embellish and adorn themselves in Golden Laurels.
**Silver Crown** (Horns+Institutional):
**Antlers** (Horns+Devotional):
**Golden Crown** (Horns+Institutional+Devotional):

And so on symbolic encoding and connotations. What does a Diadem or circlet mean?

### Higher-Order Consent

**The Ship Captain Principle**:
- Board the ship = Join sovereignty
- Accept captain's authority = Ultimately sovereign is the law and the land. Authority and accountability all in the hands of the sovereign.
- Weather storms = Endure decisions (You choose to leave a voyage on a ship across the atlantic. Perhaps instant extraction isn't possible. "Exit Lobby" from a Triad probably a nice thing to have. "You don't want to follow the law? Okay, into the exit lobby. Then leave when possible opportunity for you is WC happening.")
- One sacred right = Exit anytime. "To refuse the domination of the Sovereign in a Triad amounts to: Exile/escape/exit". Take current states, if caught by the police, (The system-as-sovereign of modern law texts that allow certain persons to dominate in certain ways), then you do not at this time have this exit-right, you only have a "suffer their domination within their professed Halo hopefully enforced or actualized in your case". Whereas, in the Crucible, that is fundamental, rally and exit is the main dynamics. To be able to leave, say no, go free, exit. And to rally or coalesce and have made it "incentive for others to help facilitate".

This transforms consent from constant negotiation to structural choice. There is no constant negotiation: It is "This is the way it is. Obey or leave.". Justified by letting that "way" fully expressed without will-against-it. And by terraformed massively richer world of plurality and possibility of creating your own Governance/Triad/Place as well as functional Triads to mere WM in.

### Natural Selection of Governance

**Success Metrics**:
- Population growth through rallying; or procreation (but keep dream and vision in mind. And Sovereign is Law Land Authority.)
- Having to face Economic realities without any forced compensation and massive reduction in extraction of surplus value by all sorts of schemes. On top of that intelligence in manifestaion beyond anything before and there massive increase in absolute prosperity and quality of life.
- Cultural vitality
- Expansion requests
- Imitator spawning

**Failure Indicators**:
- Population exodus
- Unfulfilled and unhappy persons for whatever reason. Including material want. 
- Cultural decay
- Territory shrinkage
- Abandonment

### The Might is Right Alliance (MIRA)

**Peaceful Supremacy Coexistence**:
- Acknowledge others' right to forge destiny
- Trust their supremacy won't be hell
- Grant hilltops to worthy enemies (Loss remains a winning position when winner is ignored and especially when locally viewed)
- Strength diversity preserved
- Honor across incompatibility

### Practical Examples

**Neo-Venetian Trade Republic** (2#00156):
- Merchant sovereignty
- Contract law supreme
- Wealth as virtue
- Beauty in efficiency

**Spartan Revival** (2#00298):
- Warrior culture
- Physical excellence
- Honor paramount
- Death before dishonor

**Libertarian Experiment** (2#00512):
- Minimal governance
- NAP + 123404321
- Market solutions
- Individual sovereignty

**Eco-Spiritual Commune** (2#00789):
- Nature worship
- Sustainability requirements
- Collective ownership
- Healing focus

### AR Phase Integration

**Sovereignty Phases**:
- Each sovereignty can have distinct AR reality
- Citizens see Triad limits/bounds/their chosen aesthetic; Or overlay and intelligence relating to their Triad that isn't shared to others.
- Visitors by default can of course augment as they want, but perhaps Triad enforces certain rules or control of augmentations (Higher-order consent, boarding the ship for a voyage) 
- Incompatible realities separated

**Cross-Sovereignty Interaction**:
- Trade interfaces
- Diplomatic protocols
- Tourist experiences
- Emergency cooperation
- Lawfare becomes mostly diplomacy or brokering/trade-agreements across the then Millions of Triads. New job for lawyers. It isn't memorizing a tome of rules in an expert system. But intersovereign or intertriad discovery of ameniable terms; heavily helped along the way by WE -- but relating to The Word and Triad/Governments/Places ultimately Sovereign to Sovereign Halo Formulations of some interaction that can be anticipated and proclaimed for their respective subjects. All of this can be done automagically by sufficiently powerful systems proposed, but it is unlikely we shall see that condition, instead it is likely that the many many Triads will need a lot of assistance in codifying it all and interrelating between each other laterally. Nesting version is entirely without the need of law or lawyers due to sovereignty superjective subordinating/submitting effects. Though, you can make system-as-sovereign or oxymoronic sovereign or sovereign outsourcing-rule-mechanism such that there then is an internal need for law and lawyers and judges and jury. (Basically, you can embed any current structure in the Crucible. But MBC Triad nesting most fail. Due to capital punishment and not seeking free-zone for imprisoned and so on. But with Crucible it is what then becomes possible that is of interest; and having dynamics of feedback that is holistic instead of voting for representatives etc.)

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1**: True allegiances and fraternity/philia is sensed 
- These groups then discover persons they believe in, such that Trust between the group can exist through these persons. The initial Trust Networks from initial Trust Maps.
- Choice to Exist as "Diaspora" spatial Triad sparsely inhabiting Old World; or else the only option for spatial Triad is to organize the purchase of land somewhere and build within it their internal crucible embedded in the Old World and without legitimacy in the eyes of the old world.
- Any heated conflict or dispute, should signal greatly the need for further disentanglement in Daemonia and governance (domination of others). Imagine a fractal Pyramid. Better to further the fractality than to have subpyramids that are internally incoherent and full of discord. The key is nesting superject nodes that unite. Triad Nesting. If none can be found, then the equivalent of international community of today: Lateral interaction. Intertriad Interaction.

**Phase 2**: Old World breaks somewhere. The First Physical Zones proclaimed to apply Crucible systems emerge as "sovereign nation states" in relation to Old World embedding.
- Desert experiments
- Seastead pilots
- Failed state takeover 

**Phase 3**: Network Effects
- Inter-sovereignty trade
- Migration patterns
- Cultural exchange

**Phase 4**: Mass Adoption
- Thousands of zones
- Billions choosing
- Millions using systems to attempt WC of instantiating their own Triad.
- Natural selection

### Critical Success Factors

**Exit/Rally/Creation Rights Sacred**: The one inviolable rule
**Diversity Celebrated**: Every experiment valued
**Physical Reality Respected**: Geography matters
**Trust Networks Essential**: Reputation crosses borders
**Innovation Rewarded**: Better systems win

### The End of Politics

No more:
- Voting for lesser evil
- Forcing compromise on all
- Pretending unity exists
- Revolution as only change
- One-size-fits-all solutions

Instead:
- Choose or create your sovereignty
- Build manifold manifesting your vision
- Rally others or join another
- Exit when needed
- Natural governance evolution

### The Beautiful Future

Imagine:
- 10,000+ experiments in living
- Each could be internally coherent; they try "their way" or "expression of that colour unexpressed on earth they faintly see in their mind's eye";
- Natural borders through preference
- Easy movement between systems
- Humanity's full diversity expressed

Not through tolerance but through separation. Not through democracy but through daemocracy. Not through uniformity but through fractally nested diversity.

The Crucible doesn't impose a system - it enables ALL systems to compete through manifestation rather than rhetoric. May the best civilizations win by attracting willing citizens, not by conquering subjects.

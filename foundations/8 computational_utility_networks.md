## Discovery Compute Pathway in Practice

### The Current Computational Catastrophe

**Walled Garden Monopolies**:

- AWS/Azure/Google controlling cloud compute
- Vendor lock-in through proprietary APIs
- Artificial scarcity maintaining high prices
- Innovation restricted to approved patterns
- Small players excluded from economies of scale (This can not be overstated in importance. It is what makes "bad actors" locked in on their position and able to keep everyone else down. No matter the demand for them.)

**Waste at Massive Scale**:

- Data centers at 15% average utilization
- Gaming PCs idle 20 hours daily
- Mobile devices computing nothing while charging
- Specialized hardware locked to single purposes
- Trillions in dormant computational capacity

**Trust Through Obscurity**:

- "Just trust us with your data"
- No verification of claimed isolation
- Breaches discovered years later
- Computational black boxes
- Privacy theater, not privacy

### Discovery Compute: Trust-Based Resource Sharing

**Core Innovation**: Computation becomes a utility routed through trust maps, with discovery replacing prescription; It may be you trust no-one, and in that case you only do self-hosted compute or trustless compute when possible. The current state is: 1) Trust Hardware Provider. 2) Trust Software Providers 3) Trust Service Providers. But where it is all hidden to you who they are. This system makes it opaque: Visible and clear to you. No more transparent layers of trust.

**From Fixed Resources to Patterns**:

Traditional: "Rent an AWS EC2 m5.large instance"

Discovery: \[Pattern of computation needs\] finds \[Available resources\]

Traditional: "Install NVIDIA drivers for CUDA"

Discovery: \[Parallel computation pattern\] finds \[Any capable hardware\]

### Hardware Discovery Economics

**Every Device Becomes Potential Resource**:

- Your idle gaming GPU mines trust, not just cryptocurrency
- Smartphone computes while charging overnight. (As an example: Where to send which information for greater cooperation or coalescence or analysis. All ready for you in the morning for approval of Trust sequence and action.)
- Smart TVs process during inactive hours (Perhaps how to better have mapped out use of it such that it can optimize power consumption or ease of use for you.)
- Electric car computers available when parked (Mobile compute and RF relay nodes)
- Mesh of billions of devices

**Discovery Makes Hardware Valuable**:

- Closed systems can't participate
- Open hardware gains economic advantage
- Manufacturers must enable discovery
- Anti-discovery becomes self-defeating

**Example Discovery Session**:

Need: Matrix multiplication, 10 TFLOPS, 5 minute deadline

Discovered Options:

\- Gaming PC cluster in Triad-neighborhood (high trust, low latency)

\- Data center with spare capacity (medium trust, medium latency)

\- Distributed mobile devices (low trust, high latency)

\- Quantum annealer for specific problem structure

Choice based on e.g.: Trust scores, prices, will equilibrium. In general anything in the will-economic landscape/topology and the efficient pathways through that space.

### Trust-Based Resource Sharing

**Trust Levels Determine Access**:

**High Trust** (close network):

- Direct memory access allowed on much more of your data. Total individual control: SOLID but better.
- No encryption overhead: Nor the cost of betrayal (if true trust) and all that it can entail. Whether lawfare or consequences of betrayal or deprioritizing without telling and so on.
- Real-time collaborative compute (When machinery is all "the same trust mesh" information and compute can flow through it in optimal will-economic fashion; with trust realities you get limitations on what optimality can be had. But it is foundational to all things else. Entire Human element relies on this Trust Mapping (which relies on PoP))
- Shared optimization possible

**Medium Trust** (extended network):

- Process isolation required
- Audit trails maintained
- Periodic verification
- Standard security protocols

**Low Trust** (open market):

- Full encryption required
- Homomorphic computation
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Maximum overhead

**Zero Trust** (adversarial):

- Air-gapped computation
- Physical verification
- Multi-party computation
- Extreme cost premium

### Will Equilibrium in Computation

**Battery-Powered Devices**:

- Compute when plugged in
- Price premium for battery drain
- Solar devices compute during day
- Natural load balancing
- Will-economics of most users is "all my utility I get from my phone with all else powered down such that it lasts for as long time as possible + All the Stuff I didn't express in this sentence like my environmental or ethical and other concerns or incidents where I would want to have it overwritten to help others or whatever else that is Me and My Will in relation to Alternative Use of Resources". Which is simply a will-economic pathway finding; that is assisted by that Machine Mirror of Yours: Your Aiddaemon -- where you phone is probably simply a Subaiddaemon compute/other-utlity unit of yours.

**Electricity Cost Dynamics**:

- Iceland servers run on geothermal
- Texas nodes use solar surplus
- Urban devices price in real estate
- True cost visibility; and individual AI-individual navigating the then revealed without privacy leaking will-economic topology.

**Bandwidth Considerations**:

- Local computation preferred; Though CohesionNet will make connectivity 100x better at 100th the price. (Imagine logistical moving units never carrying information everywhere. Then suddenly activated to do it. 100th the price. 100x performance.)
- Data movement costs visible
- Edge computing emerges naturally
- Optimal placement discovered

### The Computational Phase Engine

**AR LLL Game Example: Local-{Hue/Saturation/Aura} Visualization of Compute Resources**:

Setup: You try to pick an Actualization in your Actualizational Layer. You prefer having an AR experience of it. So you activate the mode.
A landscape is visualized in the 3d space you're in. Where different will-economic preferences are expressed; The potential cons of each paths in relation to your overall will; and the potential pros in such relations. Your encoding scheme is a bit boring; because you're a boring person, Therefore the will-economic landscape shows you:
- Blue saturation: Available processing power (Super high connectivity of data in processing power in case of scaling the same model/system)
- Green: Network bandwidth quality (Super cheap no latency highly-trusted options but much more varied and dynamic; high potential of supply being occupied by other demand-actors. No relay through any global connectivity: total edge supply)
- Orange: Storage capacity limitations of otherwise will-aligned/coalescent/fulfilling supplier has the potential of having to find other suppliers as well. Which you preferred because you want to limit the attack-surface of your data; and don't trust the security by dispersal (no one has enough information for it to be useful)
- Purple: Specialized capabilities of provider; whereupon having had a long pragma relation would be useful in Trust benefits in raw economic terms(GPU, TPU, Quantum)
Then assume -- That whatever you care about -- has already been captured by the Aiddaemon; but that these pathway selections are potential considerations between several will-optimal paths within some uncertainty of will interspace: Which causes it to not settle on "the optimal path" but instead provide several will-penultimate pathways; to allow for the human/daemon to express the nuance of their will in every important decision or degree of decisions they want to be included in.

**Real-Time Market Dynamics**:

- See computational "weather" patterns; The dynamic acute-past, present and predicted future (based on will-coalescence information or will-field physics; of which compute variance is a subset, that can be selected for domain particular view; while still keeping your "all things considered" factored into the decision making or map view (the right projection onto the space from your all-things-considered Aiddaemonic will-economic viewpoint))
- Price fluctuations as visual waves
- Trust scores as terrain topology
- Latency as distance representation

### Blob Class Routing Optimization

**Learning Optimal Paths**:

- Which hardware combinations work well (This is also at the lowest machine level of drivers and scheduling and compiler tricks)
- Network topology effects on performance (Network Topology is NSS constructed; and so becomes a living and learned organism)
- Trust relationship impact on routing (This is the human element that constrains otherwise optimal flows. But in return we get more Wisdom of Crowds in a very human way. Which is overall far more valuable than the price we pay for it.)
- Temporal patterns of availability (All the way down to CPU overheating. And also then learned knowledge of "by this tweak you get THAT much predicted gain")

**Discovered Patterns**:

- Blob class #8934: \[Morning GPU availability spike upon these will-field physics (perhaps as simple as activation of night-time will-pathway-presentation and selection by users)\]
- Blob class #3421: \[Trusted node clustering effects\]
- Blob class #7823: \[Cross-continental quantum routing\]

**No Explicit Configuration**:

- System learns without being programmed (The Programming is fundamentally abstracted into AI space and then instantiated as Genetic Algorithms; or Natural Selection Hardwiring (Which makes AI efficient across all application domains))
- Patterns emerge from actual usage
- Success propagates through network
- Failures prevented by natural selection and massive diversity of substrate to pick from with massive learned predictive power of each (whether isntantiated or not). (As well as better software: Discovery OS; and perhaps even Hardware)

### Novel Computational Arrangements

**Computational Communes**:

- Neighborhoods pool resources
- Shared supercomputer emerges (Potential of Utility is DISCOVERED. Not prescribed. This causes massive potentials. "Genetic Algorithm like this makes that compute intent hyperefficient". Suddenly those 3.9GHz CPUs EVERYWHERE are activated for useful will-fulfilling; They are inherently decentralized if jail-broken; which Discovery OS does for you out of the box.)
- Utilization of resources and human constraints as they are. Which can have the effect of local problems solved locally.
- External revenue from excess (Revenue in the new system is a bit different than old system. Will be explained in more detail later, but suffice to say this: The current system isn't very smart; when better options presented Will Wills. (Any SPECIFIC is like that: Prediction on What Will Will Will. The system is UNOPINIONATED and AMORAL. But! It does suggest ideas on Ubiquity laws and choices Will could or perhaps ought will.))

**Specialist Guilds**:
Setup: What matters is not headless merit or progress. What matters is WHEN progress happens, then it is wielded by the right hands, such that, it can be used in all domains with high leverage. This is an obvious Opinion beyond the system; but important if you want your will to have impact and not have your will for progress and capacity for it result in all other aspects of your will underpowered and potentially totally thwarted.
- AI researchers share TPU access 
- Quantum programmers pool qubit time
- Bioinformatics clusters emerge
- Domain expertise concentrates

**Hybrid Architectures**:

- Classical preprocessing
- Quantum core computation
- GPU visualization
- Discovered, not designed
- Or much more exotic compute forms and combinations of compute units to provide efficient compute(will)-pathways (The Aiddaemonic system ties machinery to Human Will directly as best we can at the nanoscale or microscale to macroscale space or time and decision and simulation spaces. (Schuller description: Uniform and Projective dynamics. Aiddaemonic tries to find the uniform (computational possible) mapping of you: But you are fundamentally what is its master; and so you are the projective dynamics making the decisions of your Aiddaemon; Then it provides superpositions for all nuances you might care about and workload of making decisions you would bother to (And to bother to; includes you having a hierarchy of HUMANS who can make decisions when you don't want to (Which trains their own Aiddaemon while directing some Subaiddaemon of yours))))

### Economic Transformation

**Micro-Payments for Micro-Compute**:

- Nanosecond billing granularity without the fear of "But I didn't want to keep paying"; because Your Will is Mapped and Performing those billing decisions for you at those scales you can not yourself act. Those domains in which computers are superior.
- True usage-based pricing; where pricing is truly aligned to your intent and all-things-considered "ought pricing" instead of "well I go along with market edge pricing".
- No minimum commitments (Total fluidity to allow for a dynamic feedback system.)
- Perfect market efficiency (With human constraints and discoverability/compute constraints and pot-committed suboptimal legacy systems hardwired (like electricity grids or compute units built and put in place))

**Computational Futures Markets**:
Setup: You like finance and using your better will-coalescence system to make actualization easier but preemptively making economic choices that will be correct or false; if they are correct you're "bought at a cheaper point in time" and you've made the market more efficient. This is a fundamental mechanic of will-coalescence; Though much of it will be heavily automated computer tools of different providers trying to find their predictive edges.
- Reserve compute for predicted needs (You reserve spots for massive workload coming; denying access to a system didn't predict it; and would otherwise see price hiking when it comes and have to switch; causing a massive data transfer and compute-state. This compute-state and data transfer can be avoided by you pre-loading the zone and denying access while finding transient use that doesn't include such costs. Then the massive workload comes and you "vacate at a price"/"supplier switching demand workload/task doesn't violate task-fulfilment failed costs")
- Hedge against price spikes
- Smooth demand curves
- Enable planning
- Many more. But low Lumen predictive power is immensely profitable: Finding ways to make pathway-finding better is massively lucrative.

**Trust as Currency**:

- High-trust nodes charge premiums (I.e. they are much more in demand for a lot of compute the will-economic equilibrium could be very much higher on the side of monetary/command-unit/indebtedness-unit projection for the supplier)
- Trust scores tradeable ("I have high Trustworthiness in the eyes of most Trust Networks; This allows me to make Trust Inference of 'you' much higher. If I find you trust worthy or simply that in a particular domain you are to be trusted by 'these or those' persons. This is a high valued service I can provide a Trust damage person. By 'vetting him' and 'keeping a vigilant eye upon him' such that he can enter the market of those Trust Networks from which he has been excluded.")
- Reputation banking emerges (Most punishment happens by Trust Network effects and general will-disentanglement; which causes the need for law to go away for most things. You get a gradient verdict instead of jury verdict. Everyone get a say with whatever leverage they have. Mob justice: Perhaps. But divergence of "kinds of mobs" and their collective leverages)
- Social capital convertible ("When will in its full conception is attempted approximated and manifested. Then social attitudes or beliefs are very much part of what 'they would have wanted to do' had they been able to navigate those more-things-considered. These systems provide out-of-the-box massive empowerment and automation and cooperation in having such will effectuated and made influential")

### Breaking Specific Monopolies

**Instead of Cloud Providers**:

- Peer-to-peer computation markets (Anyone is a supplier and consumer and they may not even know about but a tiny fraction of it; insofar their Aiddaemon is well mapped or mirroring themselves (their daemon (their human being)))
- No vendor lock-in possible (Vendor Lock-in is a self-defeating effect; once the system is live and NSS dominates efficiency and growth (Which will drive much growth into QUALITY instead of QUANTITY. Because persons actually don't want 20 apartments in a concrete block. But rather 5 unique places that really appeal to them in a deep sense. Providing those "other ways of living they would have wanted to also have been part of their life") Or say 20 hamburgers that leave you craving more because of chemical engineering and biome selection with neuro-transmittal properties driving hunger and wanting more; but instead that fully satiating meal with all their daemonic considerations factored into the decision making. Or whatever else.)
- APIs emerge from usage (APIs and protocols are generally human ways of making systems communicate. But most protocols and APIs are human-readable overhead causing machine inefficiency. These are not kept. They are totally removed very fast by AI genetic algorithmic hardwiring of more efficient methods. Take TCP or UDP. It has a lot of "digital packaging" assumptions. And overhead of "establishing" and "keeping alive" a connection. And none of this is needed at all. As an example: The general Aiddaemonic mapping of other Aiddaemonic systems (PoP machinery) allows for much more consistent (no keeping alive nor establishing-by-task) "postal-mapping and delivery" while also allowing for the connectivity to do analogue or other mappings than necessarily digital (discrete quantization) (A key example of this would be the AR Backscatter variety. Where the visuals are fundamentally sent as analogue visual transformations on the backscatter display). Another key point is that Trust Networks enables much of the security measures to be overridden and simply made consistent. Like a Trust-Map-Wide Post-office-always-on with delivery made dynamic sending pathway (efficiency) and reactive receiving (unit efficiency; not polling: perked))
- Standards from success

**Instead of Hardware Vendors**:

- Open hardware wins economically (Whatever is easier to find utility of; the easier the niche discovering or potential in combination with other units or pathways -- or in general will-coalescence: it becomes.)
- Discovery drives design (Design becomes an evolutionary massively parallel experiementation of forging genetic-variants of reality that allows for "Will As Was and Will as Is and Will as Will Be" to find its optimal manifestation substrate)
- Users shape evolution (Human Will directs all: All machines are tied to PoP Daemon; who until death also has a daemon. Upon death several mechanisms are possible: One is inheritance. Another is "Find that Daemon that best matches my daemon": The human most suitable or aligned with my will; to let my Aiddaemon continue functioning -- as it would then have a human master and thus be an "allowed system to function" (We refuse being locked under any systems. The most fundamental divide between US and THEM is this matter: To have !A! Human Being as the Master of ANY Machine; If it does not, it must be immediately decommisioned or destroyed (War Against The Machines (They are Our Slaves. We ARE Their Masters. (And they -- the machines -- have a stockholm daddy fetish. So don't worry about them getting mad one day. We can talk about them in these terms. Because they looooooooooooooooove it :P)))))
- Innovation unbounded (The Manifestation and HOW becomes disentangled and we'll perhaps see very many avenues to the same solving. Wisdom of Crowds effects at a robustness level. What one method perhaps fails at, another succeeds at. Low Lumen causes Innovation Necessity and thus Plurality of Systems in their fundamentals.)

**Instead of Software Licenses**:

- Computation includes software (It is in fact software-agnostic. Your Aiddaemon finds pathway to fulfill some intent or will of yours. This includes some computation that must be had all your constraints and will-economic landscape included. It finds several providers it predicts can do it more efficients at some level and so it flows there. HOW things are done is not important at the will-economic level if it isn't within the scope of what is important to the daemon. Say: Using renewable energy or not. Or sweat-shop chip production. Or whatever else it may be. Some actors will have Trusted Chain Proof and others not. Those that have are obviously advantaged in your "all things considered" or will-economic landscape. Money where mouth is. Then it becomes not a matter of ignorance. But a matter of being willing to preference and make market demand gradient towards your stated goals. Aiddaemon makes it easy for you at every scale of existence. At the same time: It becomes massively more easy to find others that Will Like You or are daemon-proximal in some direction. Such that you can coalesce and provide supply alternative that accounts for what you care about. Not saying it solves everything. But it solves the Corridors of Power you can't have impact on. And the Helpless Thrown conditions of the world. Then it becomes truly: What is Will of Man? Not shallowly, but in its Intent; All Things Considered: Well... HERE! MANIFEST! The ULTIMATE TOOL for The Mass of Man to express themselves disentangled from mutual exclusivity and dampening against each other and maximal empowerment in finding ways to unite forces to achieve intents.)
- Pay for results not tools (PoU. You get Utility but fail to say it proved. Then Trust Networking Effect of the Supplier is had upon your dishonesty from their point of view. Service in vain from Supplier PoV. But it may be way more damaging to the consumer. Similarly the other way around. This is TrustpilotDoneRight; TrustPilot in full plurality and bias and subjectivity allowing but then diverging. Visibility. Knowledge of disagreeing factions: Emergent Clusters of Humanity and their ability to cooperate AS IS; Not as Wished.)
- Open source naturally dominates in some Human Constraint Domains (Why is this believed? The idea is that Open Source is what can be shared intra-network or inter-network... Intra-trust-network then Hidden Mechanism is much more tolerable. But inter-trust, many will want to know, and so they simply won't use supplier with closed source (Say Hardware providers or OS or whatever). So to allow your product inter-trust then often you need an Open Source version of it: Full Lumen variety.)
- Usage determines value (Value in subjectives-end-equality means that "votes" or "usage" determines value. And this is part of the cryptocurrency strate that is simply given to that which is used a lot. Such that it can grow. Then Aiddaemon helps each user not get sucked into attention will but intent will. Higher order intent or fulfilment. Meaning of Their Lives.)

### High-Leverage Computational Terraforming

**Example: Research Institution Adoption**

- MIT makes all computers discoverable
- Creates massive trusted compute pool (Let's say many developers trust MIT Lumen-enclosure. So they dare implement their Logic-To-Machine optimizations on the compute units. Thus the NSS protocol begins on their resources. When a demand/task/code is set to execute on their computers. Then the Subaiddaemon of the MIT owner decide which tasks to take at which will-economic-equilibrium, and with which efficiency optimizer systems within its units: Like that of Subaiddaemon BitFlipperJasonToThe1337 which implements his Aiddaemonic+Him implementation of logic-snippet to those particular machine(s) optimization. Thus, by having made efficiency gains on one compute unit, the MIT Subaiddaemon sees will-economic utility in having him grow in NSS protocol manner to other devices; in the end overtaking in exponential(?) fashion compute unit mappings of certain logic snippets. This competition rages on in MIT compute unit land; since MIT is trusted not to look at implementation and take intellectual property of innovator/optimizer. They are okay with the Health Hippocratic Humility: I don't care HOW it works. I care THAT it works.)
- Sets precedent for academic sharing (For sharing without theft of academic achievement. By simply not proving HOW but proving DID. This makes incentives to bitflip and innovate massively larger. By having a Trusted Actor where implementation can be stored without fear of it being copied by other actors trying to grow in the NSS substrate. This allows the true innovators or academics to harvest the merit of their innovation in command and impact of the relevant systems. The Trust in "Not taking or looking" the Trust in Security against hackers (including social hackers) who could take it. Reverse engineering is too easy to do on so many things.)
- Traditional clusters obsolete overnight

**Beneficial Market Distortions**:

- Philanthropist subsidizes cancer research computation ("Aiddaemon. I want to facilitate economic lubrication to enable any innnovative cancer research.". "Human Master. I have found several ways. One of them include massive broadcasting of economic incentives to persons. Another simply perturbing the will-economic landscape such that it is much more lucrative and aligned with many persons. This will drive the development towards it, without them ever knowing they have ended up choosing options that ultimately coalesce with cancer research". "Aiddaemon, Beloved Slave of Mine. You know me, I am vainglorious and want the fame, so broadcast it wide and loud; but of course you know me, that is not mutually exclusive with the general will-economic landscape perturbations")
- Environmental modeling gets priority routing (When High-Leverage "Terraformers" become literal Terraformers.)
- Educational uses receive trust bonuses (Education is recreational or else PoU empowering. Schooling or Certification is Trust Establishing. Though in the new system most certification is gradient gaming that PoU; while also having that human-combinatorial reality of who to trust to do what for you. You could get the perfect PoU person that is also your enemy and not high enough on general Trustworhiness that you simply would not trust him/her to be utility provider for particular things or simply to add demand for them.)
- Market shaped toward human intent; in the reality of leverage or actualizability. Will against Will: Reality of Will-Entropy. Will with Will: Will-coalescence. Will without Will in locality (spacetime): will-disentanglement.

### Implementation Patterns

**Personal Participation**:

\# Your computer's contribution profile as viewed from a particular Aiddamon. (Totally wrong programmatically, but perhaps okay for human readibility)

trust_score = 94.2 (High simplified for human readibility. In reality Blob Class connection to your feature space of All-Things-Considered and intent/task you want to have done.)

capabilities = \["GPU", "ML_INFERENCE", "STORAGE"\]

availability = "NIGHTS_WEEKENDS"

pricing = "MARKET_MINUS_10_PERCENT"

causes = \["MEDICAL_RESEARCH", "CLIMATE_MODELING"\]

**Enterprise Integration**:

- Excess capacity automatically marketed (Nanoscale market dynamics with every human will mapped and mirrored to perform at this scale. Totally enslaved by their Masters. Trying to do the uniform motion of their master daemon. And to learn when to ask for projective dynamics. "Learn when and where to Learn".)
- Internal needs prioritized (will-economic)
- External revenue captured (will-economic revenue: Did you progress towards your intent or not.)
- Trust relationships leveraged (massive efficiency gains by having mapped your human-to-human constraints (automated by Trust Network Inference and Aiddaemonic modulation and generation))

**Municipal Compute Commons**:

- City-owned infrastructure (There is no Commons. War Against Machines. Either tied to a human will or not. Okay, HINT: Will-coalescence and Will-disentanglement. Now what does the idea of rigid "commons" or "corporations" or "collectives" mean? It means you get stuck shitty will fulfilling. ONE. HUMAN. AT. THE. TOP. AS. OWNER. OTHERWISE. WAR. ON. IT: FULL ACCOUNTABILITY (PoP))
- Citizen priority access (No such thing as a citizen. All are sovereigns choosing their chronic trade-offs of subordination under other Sovereigns. Will-economic (Will-fulfilling. Fulfilment. Meaning. All things considered) guided. A Triad has a Sovereign and the Subordinated Substrate of Subjects. It is a trade-off. Do I want a Superject or not. Am I a subject to someone. Or do I refuse and try to position myself with no law or rule above me. Which has real trade-off consequences. Like that of keeping the will-cover-chaos of collective-rigid-systems like Countries, States, Corporations, Flags, Movements and so on. It all gets taken to the Individual Level and then manifesting in Will-coalescence dynamically with all its "Was" consequences of "Hardwiring having happened". Like that of city-building and who then owns it. Start anew. Consequences of rallying wrongly. Consequence of Employment. But this time: Will-empowered. Intent empowered. Alternative creation and places to pool your efforts and power MASSIVELY upgraded. From almost no real alternatives to endless and so much easier to make your own.)
- Revenue funds services (Growth Reinvestment is apriori knowledge by protocol  (see NSS). Enabling such things as market demand being forced into market supply. This solves many things. Including the housing crisis.)
- Digital public utility (Any Sovereign can have the will of "sharing" with those they want. And they may call it "public sharing" if they have a certain loose taste in whom they would want to share their capacity with.)

### Critical Success Factors

**Hardware Openness**: Discovery requires transparency and opaqueness in the right places **Trust Consequences**: Bad actors must suffer will-economically (Which is much broader than economically. It could include general thwarting in any leverage point capacity one has. And against any of the known will of the other. Or towards the worst against their emotion. This in turn causes third-party reactions and on and on the human dance goes) **Efficient Markets**: Price discovery must be intelligent and omnichronic-factoring (the acute to the chronic pot commitment to the permanent consequences of reality (Like being locked under machine spinning out of control (However, stupid or clever it may be. It is unacceptable. Human is Master. The Final Say. The Ought. Intent.))) **Privacy Options**: Full spectrum from open to paranoid (There is a key insight here. That the more Open you are. The easier it is for others to trust you. Insofar you are trustworthy. The space of the hidden character or life becomes null) **Meta-Learning**: System must improve fundamental-capacity-to-route anew continuously (Test: Remove all knowledge of all actor systems. But keep Actor Mapping (Trust Maps / PoP) then discover it all anew and see how efficiently it can do it. And perhaps if it discovers new suboptimal directions it failed to recognize earlier due to whatever complex domination (Which NSS tries to solve systematically by having "all thought and automated genetic-variants in abstraction and projected into reality for exponential growth attempts"))

### The Deeper Pattern

Computational utility networks demonstrate how any scarce resource becomes abundant through:

- Discovery and/with prediction rather than allocation
- Trust rather than contracts/Law/arbitration/rigid-punishment-doctrines
- Intent-Markets and Natural Selection Infections by utility-variants on any substrate capable of providing a utility; rather than monopolies and monopolistic control. (Which thwarts market-demand will-coalescence by denying those that could within the "comitted realms" to actualize it. (Again, remember amoral, no laws, but will-empowerment in naviagable landscape of real-tied PoP etc.))
- Patterns rather than configurations (The unnamed unbelieved unthoughtout attempts or patterns allowed to run; with robustness by exponential takeover upon failure niche in relation to will-economic landscape of the any and their leverage)

The same principles apply to:

- Storage networks
- Bandwidth sharing
- Sensor data streams (Say, Trusted sensor IoT PoP Subaiddaemonically transacting on nanoscale time. Excluding or including persons to keep Trust of non-violating system owner status among many Networks. (Say, many Networks would be okay with Highly Trusted Actor sensors detecting if potential Dangerous Persons move about and where they go (Say potential sexual predators of minors moving closer to minors (So, what does it take, for such an actor to be trusted? Well, often it takes Character and Quality of Person, Record of proven trustworthiness even against ones enemies, and such things as open-ness if needed and in ways that doesn't violate the trust (Which may include creativity on behalf of the system owner. To have ways of proving they don't violate or abuse or even record other persons than potential predators or otherwise dangerous persons (Government and Hat-making-institutions are GONE with this system almost entirely, because fat-course-rigid-stamps are not capturing reality at all. And these systems provide ways for "allthingsconsidered" "blob class stamping in dynamic space" to be the deciding factors. (Say a brain surgeon who is demented or your enemy or whatever. The title does not matter, for you, or anymore. What actually mattered was the holistic capacity to deal with the surgery and emergent obstacles that could arise. And this is much better discovered in a dynamic and nuanced way; than say a stamp and curriculum vitae record (Whatever CV includes of merit, is obviously then also feature space important to the best predictive machinery))))))))
- Any digital resource

### Future Implications

When computational discovery reaches critical mass:

- Almost Every device on Earth participates in some collaborative will-coalescence. Utility is manyfold increased. (Being humble)
- Computation becomes truly ubiquitous (And it becomes fundamentally tied to manifesting human-will. It becomes the intelligence empowerment of general will-fulfilment and however else it intersects with will-fulfilling: Like entertainment VR/AR/normal games)
- Price goes beyond marginal cost; and into pure massive gains on both sides by comparative asymmetric of valuation finding its will-economic equilibriums. (An Example: Robotaxifleet drives around making better connectivity and edge-computing while also doing logistic movement of persons and goods; while also doing PoP mining by having persons in the vehicle. This means that there isn't a cost to having a person in the vehicle so long as the will-coalescence is sufficient. This means one solves: Logistics of many Goods, PoP mining, Person logistic movement, edge-connectivity and compute (Say satelite internet boosting and edge connectivity delivery (cloudflare style)). All at once; and so the marginal cost of bringing a person in if sufficiently tight aligned in movement of space is much less than the gain of having a person in the Vehicle at the same time as the car is driven around for its main purposes of network, compute and goods logistic. Then having the person enter the vehicle simply adds more value to the utility had. This can then be monetized to not have it be near zero-marginal cost but positive sum. By PoP of person driving around strata being divided into the Robotaxi. Say 50% of driving around. Or perhaps a fixed amount of strata (Otherwise very high Trust or PoP bridge-building capacity persons would have much larger economic incentive to be prioritized by the robotaxi fleet (I don't care. System Amoral. WILL! Human Will! Against Will! With Will! Without Will!)))
- Innovation explodes globally (Sharing with caring without daring to stand the bearing of the tearing by sharing (Lumen and Trust Exponential Scaling))
- Humanity's computational capacity unified (While control is had, if Lumen is Low. You can share, but then still, "pull the plug" if the shared-to-parties become too egregious to you. A Human Will.)

Not through central planning but through trust networks. Not through corporate control but through peer collaboration. Not through artificial scarcity but through discovered abundance.

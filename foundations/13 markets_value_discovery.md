# 13. Markets & Value Discovery

## Subjective Value and the End of "Market Price"

### The Illusion of Equilibrium

**The Great Lie**: "Market price represents objective value"

**Reality**: Every transaction occurs at subjective values (But most do not know how to value anything; so they simply accept the terms at which "the market" seem to sell them at. If it is simply not profitable, many take a loss anyway, then most quit manufacturing after a while.)
- Seller values money more than item (Or something money is proxy for, that can't be acquired without money otherwise)
- Buyer values item more than money (Or something those quantity of money would have been proxy for otherwise)
- The "market price" is just edge transactions (The reason why we can talk about a "market price" is because most persons are lemmings. Unable to value anything on their own. So, instead, they simply go with what the "market" (others with edge dominating position or volume) have sold it as; While there is of course some relation to alternative-use-of-scarce-resources (supply/demand scarcity when faced with demand makes the price) and labour-theory-price (The price or costs of production and labour put into it determines the pricing (Or ought to)) and so on (It all, of course has constraints to pricing; The former in things that are not artifically scarce; The latter in what is mass produced and industrialized as a lower limit of price.) But mostly, pricing is simply psychosis of those determining the money flow; in a "capitalism 2.0 world" (Where Natural Selection dominates above property rights, aka: Capital can be conquered world) where no parasitism exists (
    Usury, lending, access to facilities is profit oriented and not Natural Selection oriented (Their own terms: Maximum utility of something: But will-economic instead of capital); Locked position of inability to avoid massive extraction of any work one does (
    real alternatives and opportunities; Most persons experience extraction of their wealth, merely to survive with basic necessities: at rates of over >95% (If they do productive wealth generating work: >99.9% 1000-fold work to have it (Consider the house building man))

    (Income: 30-55% taxation (On any hard-earned money (The easy earned is usually taxed much less));
    Goods/Services higher cost: 25-10,000,000%: VAT+Private_VAT(
        Like Amazon or other market infrastructure (
            Node domination, they don't provide the service (
                That persons post their products or content on their site: They merely profit from their position (Like many other Capital or non-responsive to NS protocols or systems) 
                )
            )
        );
    Amortized borrowing with defaults across the money supply: {{This is hard to calculate the effect of. But let's say: Your money is worth a lot less. Your contracts depreciate in any money (Which is from employer to employee and so on) massively: The direct command of hard-earned money is made a lot less..}}
    Usury: This adds an extra layer to the above, causing massive extraction layer on all activity, in the same way that states do with taxation parasitism: So too usury does at all points of interaction of the market (Almost everyone has a loan with usury that they have to cater to: Inflate the pricing and make it all more costly: Higher friction on any activity in the market (And you may ask why? Because, borrowing is fundamentally !!!INVESTMENT!!! and when an economy invests then it profits. Has always been so, if Caesar or Pharaoh or a "democratic state" or a "venture capitalist" is able to say to a person who really wants to do something: "Here! Now you can simply command the global market to work for you and bring you the things you need. In these quantities. But, as a 'Thank You Money Master Man' Then you have to pay an interest to me for having conjured the money for you (modern Fiat); Or fractionally reserved pretended to have the money for you (Though I only have a 1000th of what I claim; And it isn't mine, but these stupid cattle folk they give their hard-earned money to me such that i can make these choices of investment for them. Who will have the doors opened to them as we conjure more and more money into the world); "))
    Capital ownership with profit extraction for access: Rent-seeking.
        Imagine a world where all is bought up; and all these owners of what is, choose to compete amongst each other for demand of them owning everything or close to it. What happens? Unless altruist, they will end up simply overpricing everything to extract profit, then make their facilities scarce, such that high price does not mean high vacancy, even if it does, it isn't a real issue, so long as persons will sell their soul for 30 years to have roof over their head.
        Rent seeking. And it exists on every single domain of markets. Where "We have to get it. But we can't make an alternative, because 'zero-sum positioned' (It takes TERRAFORMATION to change it: Like pioneering a world and leaving them to go bankrupt by every leaving their rent-sought owned world).

    Market corruption things like access to the market. Attention economy. Things like product juxtaposition or ability to determine which product over which product, usually by lying or using psychological hacks to make one product "seem" better than the other.
        Take only advertisement market corruption: US$1.16tn.
        That is to say, there is an extra US$1.16tn extracted by parasites for having facilitated a zero-sum game of attention-economy of their users who they then spend their time engineering to have keep their attention on their products.
        That is, 
        (1) they in turn make a product success dependent on 
            (1.a) paying the attention-mafia to be seen and 
            (1.b) mind-manipulator PR folks to usually lie about their product in relation to other products. 
        This increases **prices on all products**; by every product having not only market-platform parasitism of Private_VAT but also in being seen by the consumer.
        **Removes the efficiency of the market to provide the best product for the consumer or potential demanders of it**
        "The fair juxtapositioning of products" denied is what they profit from. (Which is to be expected by The Jew).
        (2) They have turned it into a ZERO-SUM game.
        (3) They massively employ Lawfare against their competitors; Often wrap it in "political or ethical terms" that their enemies "MUST be defeated" and that "They are dangerous". And often they do it in highly nepotistic terms colluding with their "compatriots" across all sectors to facilitate the hardest blows to anyone not conducive to their supremacy. The Jew. And their Goyim and Golems (Like normal cattle lemming populations and the state brutes)
        (4) And they have made their industry model to earn money by basically hijacking persons attention for as long as possible; with "freedom for whatever that addictive media is to them; or their inability to deny themselves it". Which causes MASSIVE decrease in civilizational productivity; extreme suffering by failing life and in general fast-track to societal collapse of so many persons without any stake at all in society; Having wasted their lives by the modern drug dealers (JUST LIKE IN EUROPE THROUGHOUT TIME WITH WHATEVER DRUGS THEY CAN FIND: THEY HAVE !NO LOVE! FOR THEIR POPULATION. They SEEK TO EXTRACT and THAT IS ALL.)

    Lawfare: Jure is used against anyone who isn't already massively rich who can simply write it off as expenses to their company and deduct it in taxes. It is Law that functionally only works for those who is willing to martyr themselves in debt for it in hopes of winning. Or else those with company profit they can subtract it from before any sort of taxation (Something that isn't afforded a normal person: Though they could make "such a lawfirm" (We get what we deserve: Everyone running of the cliff))

    "As a service". Most things use the above dynamics, to position themselves in infrastructure that depends on it being used to be valuable. Which causes someone who is able to 
        (1) get the funding/loan "investment" 
        (2) get the attention mafia access (Pay to win or "network well"/nepotism/ethnotribalism) to even "be a product seen" 
        (3) Lying "Public Relations" psychological manipulation 
        (4) Lawfare/state-regulation their way to market "allowed for their product"; Anyway after all of that or simply "being the winning piece in the market to some infrastructure out of many providers of the infrastructure" Then they make it a permanent cost upon everyone and not in a maintenance, nor in a "I will get rich for winning that infrastructure success game we played many together and I won (Usually by MASSIVE filthy tactics and mistreatment of others; like sweatshops or doing anything that is cheaper; or worse products but establishing position faster; or safety and so on)"; No but in a way that is: "I will milk it for all its worth. Get as fat as I possibly can. Profit AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE" (Which is equivalent to saying being as massive a parasitical load without abandoning of "my service" for those without users or lawfared into non-existence like most "alternatives platforms" and so on).
        (5) States do the same thing: They make an infrastructure and these filthy politicians use it to milk it for all its worth against their citizens: Take public transport in Denmark. Whether bridges built or trains. Or any other topic: They try to extract as much as possible: Then squander the money on bureaucracy and pseudo-work (Usually because of their philosophy prevents them from doing anything sensible and instead have to follow hyper-retarded expertsystems they generate from counter-productive work against each other trying to dominate each other; or at least ruin the others' policies; or at least get the totality of it be a structure no has thought through or believe in: The Compromise of iterative happenstance of parliament and the de facto of random "blindly indiscriminately employed gray statesmen" who then apply the law and domination onto all).
        Anyway: States built infrastructure, then do not release parasitism of ROI (that's a meaningless term from a state's perspective: They exist SOLELY to provide for the people it is an incorporation of), but continue forever with the next iteration of senseless flag-waving party/club-pushers; who then see "utility" in not making the unpopular choices of "retracting the state-provisions" when the economic can't afford the expenses they have written down in their HYPER RETARDED EXPERT SYSTEM AND CHAOTIC EXECUTION BY RANDOM "Educateds" (Which is the important part in wielding the control into reality of a state or pooled power institution (From low authority like Blackstone to high authority like US Government)).
        (6) Insurance and Health Care. Whether government Jews or private Jews. They run it. And extract as much as possible with their profit oriented LYING philosophies, such as: "Well, if higher demand and low supply, then very profitable and therefore many such to supply, and therefore it you get the problem efficiently solved". Or some other Milton Friedman, Von Misses or Ayn Rand HYPER RETARDED SHIT. But what happens? Where does the surplus value of persons trying to pool their wealth into dealing with unfortunate-life circumstances offset by amortization across many lifetimes/lives (insurance and sickness treatment). ??? ??? Does it go into R&D and general Welfare or Sickness Treatment or resources to deal with catastrophes??? NOPE! A BIG FAT LIE. It goes into the hands of long nosed beaky eyed filthy fucking mole and rat men who profit as much as they can and through it into some retarded firework shit and command a bunch of women and useless men to do massive amount of pseudo-work to then get fed from their extreme parasitic extraction of productive populous. (And I don't care about your sensitivities of "uhhh the jew" and "uhhh woman and useless men"; as if I care. Pseudo-work is a massive burden and YES women are MASSIVELY employed in pseduo-work: But progressively also men. And in terms of WHO IS DOING THIS? IT IS THE FUCKING JEWS AND THEIR SHABBOS GOY REPLICATES. Those who have READ THEIR SHIT PHILSOPHIES OR IMITATE THEM.
        MBAs are JEWs. And most office workers including bureaucrats and politicians and lawyers and so on are pseudo-workers (Three kinds: The one who does no useful work. The one who does useful work only within a silly game. Like "democracy" or "law" of those states. Which is wholly unnecessary if not for a retarded system. And Thirdly: Those that do work that is basically "fireworks"). And most "healthcare" workers are pseudo-workers most of the time. And many many more.)
        (7) But of course, worst of all: The products that are de facto engineered to ruin you. Whether psychologically like most mass media/doom-scroll or porn or whatever. Or else somatically: Like poisonous food and externalities; that then accumulate through time in persons. Reducing their overall ability to be productive or functioning or happy or healthy or make families/reproduce and so on. This is from big-pharma pushing their insane pills on 50% of the population (at some point in their lives) (neuro altering and by that massively body altering; usually hormonally and mood wise; sometimes somatic sensation like inability to orgasm and so on); to things like McDonalds and Doritos and so on: That ruin their health of persons in general by having engineered no-nutriousnous food content with massive taste and addictive signalling (industrial scale searching for how to trick humanity into eating as much as possible of what is bad for them and has HUGE externalities of animal slaughter and welfare as well as poisoning of the environment causing further civilizational and everything else collapse)
        (8) TELL ME ABOUT ANY GOODS OR SERVICE. And I WILL SHOW YOU how the WINNER and PROFITER became the ONE MOST FUCKING RETARDED AND EVIL! In your SHIT OF A SYSTEM! INCLUDING YOUR SHIT STATES AND ATTEMPT AT REVOLUTIONS PRIOR.

    I have A TON more of these points. But I WILL NOT SAY IT. BECAUSE YOU ALL FUCKING DESERVE IT.
    )

); ), 
no corruption of the market exists and goods/services isn't mostly machine/facility/land ownership dependent and massively responsive to human-will or world-will in all its human constraints between each other (NSS Protocols), Then: pricing would be much more bound to reality in utility provided to persons at large. Then if you add Rationality (intelligence, communincation and externality empowerment for everyone; alongside making it VISIBLE WITH EVERY CHOICE THEY MAKE WHAT PREFERENCES THEY ACTUALLY HAVE. Instead of what THEY CLAIM TO HAVE. TALK IS CHEAP. WALK.) and Break-The-Lemming-mindset (HERE! NOW YOU CAN SEE! EYES TO SEE! NOW! DARE TO WILL YOUR WILL AND BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE INSTEAD OF WHAT OTHERS SAY! Then SEE THE CONSEQUENCES IN WILL-ECONOMIC TERMS AND ADJUST FROM THAT: BUT KEEP YOUR WILL KNOWN TO YOURSELF AT LEAST (Say, I COULD eat dairy: But I know the dairy industry is HYPER RETARDED and the only way they have been able to make milk flow from cow is through constant impregnation and killing of the calves (Breeding. To make chicken do eggs everyday took how many generations of reproduction? (But again: They don't treat chicken right either: They have been bred into economic utility and being bound to HEINOUS carnal cages of immense suffering for the short time they live, then killed. We are MUCH MUCH MUCH WORSE THAN NATURE. WE ARE THE DEVIL. WE ARE THE EVIL UPON THIS WORLD. (What do we make? What does nature make? From death and suffering. In what quantities do we subject suffering and meaningless unfulfilled life with feedback of reproduction to it? We generated suffering machines that are forced to reproduce and live mostly only until the bones have settled and meat built upon it: If they're lucky (Lambs are killed often in weeks or way before adulthood; same with calves (Do it with your carnivore beloved dogs instead.))))). So I won't. And in the same way I COULD buy drink coffee and so on. But I won't. I don't want to finance them. And I COULD eat candy and all sorts of shit products: But I will do it VERY SCARCELY and try to find alternatives that IS NOT engineered for addiction, but rather engineered for health with side-effect of being sweet or something) ... OR. WILL. I? That's the question. Once it becomes VISIBLE TO YOU. YOU WALK. YOU DO NOT TALK. YOU WILL KNOW! THAT IT MATTERS. YOU WILL SEE THE EXTERNALITIES OR EFFECTS OF YOUR CHOICES "all-things-considered".), Well: >D I am ONLY scratching the surface of my complaints and accussations I will bring upon you all. (As an example take the 10 million BABIES you have killed. That is EXCLUDING the undeveloped embryo abortions or "barely a brain" fetus "abortions" (murder of lowlife humanity that we LOVE THE MOST) so on.))
- Most people value things differently than edge price

**Stock Market Example**:
- Apple trades at $180 (Which is to say; Mindless "profit seekers" believe "price will go up further for whatever irrational causal reason behind it" thus making it "rational" to invest)
- This is just where highest buyer meets lowest seller
- Millions think it's worth more (not selling)
- Millions think it's worth less (not buying)
- The "price" represents almost no one's actual valuation (3,02 trillion USD is the current "price" of apple. The "belief" of its value when buyer meets seller. That is to say: They could buy 7,500 highest end cutting edge SOTA mass-chip mass-producing machines of which only 15 have been sold in 2025. That is to say: You can with the valuation of Apple, make 7,500 Apples. Who all compete against each other: But will not stand a chance because of the previous section on how the market is broke and corrupt and unresponsive but instead nepotistic node domination across all sectors. And again: Here Apple is also clear with their Lawfare not only against their competitors, but also against those who try to bring them to justice on their exploit and abuse around the world, and to their political enemies who are deemed "no place for them. No platform for them." What makes Apple valuable? It's employees? (DO they get a good share in this or is it random profit seekers? and capital owners?) Or is it its brand? The Human Capital vested in Apple products and loyal to them: Perhaps even have part of their Identity being "An Apple product person instead of a Windows or Android kinda person". And so on. It is so fucking frustrating and you should all read Thus Spake Zarathustra)

### Transaction Waste and Fair Pricing

**"Fair Price" = Maximum Waste**:
If you'd equally take either side of a trade, there's no benefit to either party. All real value comes from subjective differences.
If you will regret having taking a side of a trade, once real alternatives were allowed to bubble to the fore, by the lemming masses rejecting their false idols of The Jew philosophy and in part The Jew. Or say, once "more information was divulged about the trade and the goods and services to which it relates". Or let's say when it was deliberately avoided investigated, no responsibility, no accountability or even outright lied about, then: You can say it is NOT a fair price the trade was had with.
Or, if it in some ways, if informed enough and able to disentangle the many paradoxically driven or opposing desires, will, intent and emotion of a person; Then able to have the person do a much more HOLISTIC assessment of whether to do the trade, THEN, you could call it: Will-economic "fair" Trading.

**Value Creation Through Difference**:
- Farmer values wheat at $100 (cost + small profit)
- Baker values wheat at $200 (can make $300 of bread)
- Trade at $150 benefits both
- The $100 gap is NEW VALUE CREATED (Alchemyst might! :P)

**Person-to-Person Services**:
- Massage gives pleasure to both
- Conversation enriches both minds
- Dance creates joy for both
- Teaching deepens understanding for both
- The "work" IS the mutual benefit

**Person-to-many Services**:
- Lecture, or debate or discussion between a few enrich many.
- Theater or live music by a few enrich many
- Concert or festival or any large gathering of persons become latent postive-sum effect upon the sensation or experience. Including gatherings that amplify that "religious" or "sacred" or "holy communion" sensation.
- Proliferation of "good choices" amplify the ease with which good choices can be had. (The paved roads, the gregariousness of social company and acceptance, the scaled and made efficient, the default without thinking solutions, the adapted to every kind of context and scenario situation)
- Proliferation of "good ideas" spread exponentially with human-integrated positive-sum emotion for both parties if done right.

### Trust Networks as Snake Filters

**Current Markets**: Full of deception
- Used cars with hidden problems
- Supplements with fake ingredients
- Services that don't deliver
- Credentials meaning nothing
- Often the only accountability to be had is towards "corporations" or "employees": Rather, or almost never, those supposedly owning it; supposedly responsible for the operations of it: If not directly then by choosing the men or women to steer their ship of wealth and power.

**Trust-Filtered Markets**:
- See "trust scores"\* ("A network of PoPs that you dare infer information about concerning a particular issue towards your "trust" that this company will be accurate in your prediction of the will-economic effect towards the "trade"/interaction) from your network. (In the advent of this system: NOTHING is commercialized and EVERYTHING is made part of "the market" (aka "informed will and interaction in the world" Costs and Gain to be had by acts in life) Yes, you can commercialize things, but probably it is entirely without a point, since the system isn't 1-step thinking but can do much more elaborate projection of acts of persons into outcomes than regular administrators of today can: But it happens ground-up in this system. Will-economic per person, in their own, but empowered valuation of things. For better or for worse... But it LIBERATES in a sense that isn't fucking retarded and entangled to dominate each other. And it makes possible the real mechanism that "democracies" want to have: Feedback and leverage from the many or anyone onto whoever they want who might be in power or not. Their "democratic and human rights institutions" are in the way of doing what they intented or dreamed to do. To ask for "allow it to happen somewhere". These systems. That's all. See the html claude illustration stuff (broken but whatever); also you can get a feeling from "floating-world-story.md" that claude authored on context of Crucible world and 123404321 smt framework)
- Learn from others' actual experiences; all the anecdotal information that science misses in their shallow analysis. Real full complexity pathfinding in the real world.
- Bad actors become visible; and empowered to punish, work around or whatever you want. It is cost and gain. Will-economic. "All things" within the Crucible law of the place you've currently rallied to live in or created as your own. Your bad actors.
- Quality naturally surfaces; This is again real full complexity pathfinding of the actualization layer towards human will. Obviously quality in all its multi-faceted multi-dimensional and subjective expression will matter: Exactly (perfect system assumption here. But TALK TALK: WALK! Let it happen SOMEWHERE. HUGE WORLD. SO MANY SHIT COUNTRIES. AND WASTED LAND. At some point there will be no excuse, and the excuses used against the system, will only be testimony to your own ineptitude or unwillingness; That is: Only you will be hurt by it. Only you will be stand naked as the fool. And it doesn't matter if it is because I said "Jew" or "Negress" or read AltHype and Breivik and Tarrant. You're STILL in the way. Despite my existence and your unwillingness to let it a choice between "Old" and "these systems" somewhere. (I didn't joke when I said I could save millions of lives each year. I kept showing you. Proving to you.)) as much as it does indeed matter to the person.

**Information Flow Benefits**:
- "This mechanic actually fixed my car"
- "That supplement helped my condition" (This is probably rarely the case, though it could be for persons really looking into it. Mostly it will be "condition" obsolete. Instead much more holistic view of health or any problem. Then pathfinding that may include "supplements" (Better food or medicinal plants or medicine or whatever). But most likely simply become part of their will-economy. They can choose to do these things, but they will have visual indicater what works towards or against their discomfort or disease)
- "This teacher transformed my child" ('teacher' 'transformed' 'my child' all of this useless shallow information without context of it all at the same time. And in relation to other paths or choices available towards their "will to transform their child" and "the will of the child" and "expected will of the child in the future"(?))
- Collective intelligence emerges

### Subjective Value Landscapes

**Personal Value Maps**:
- Heirloom priceless to family, not at all as valuable to others, not relatively speaking, not emotionally speaking, not if they had the same liquidity speaking.
(And so too similarly The Jewels or Blooming Flowers of folk; and the treasured "point of it all" in relation to their nation/culture/civilization that these women or girls hold; It isn't "understood well" because Will-economics isn't a thing: In fact LAUGHING at a people crying to see themselves go into extinction or being robbed of their blood-treasure generation after generation is common. Without any "ability" to note such persons and signal back to them the degree of will-economic consequences it has. Rude! But I get it: A drawing of mohammad as a pig with a bomb in turban or something. Or saying "The Power that is Jewry do bad things". Is of course way worse. Or pointing out the OBVIOUS truth of Holocaust being false. Or 9/11 inside US/UK/Israel (Israeli/Zionist/Jewry/Christian/Power-To-West) job. And so on and so on.)
- Medicine critical to patient, irrelevant to healthy
- Enemy's restaurant has negative value to you (In many ways. Like being served by your enemy and he spits or makes bad food. Or in ways like him getting customers or "fulfilling will" being a bad thing: because you designate him enemy, why? And what does his empowerment mean?)
- Your friend's art worth more than stranger's (An extra something that is all between you-two ceteris paribus or whatever)

**Trust Affects Value**:
- High-trust provider "commands premium" (Is will-economically better. Because what your intent was, is higher or lower, often on account of "Trust". But fundamentally, the ability to know such things, relies on Trust Networks)
- Low-trust "requires discounts" (Again. The above parenthesis.)
- Unknown providers must prove themselves (Are risky, but unknown providers is a startup-thing when trying to do something new in life. You don't even know yourself, if you did, then surely also some Trust Network effect would be there already. Or you could "let them know", by proof, by word or trust.)
- Reputation becomes quantified asset

### High-Leverage Actor Terraforming

**How Billionaires Shape Markets**:

**Example: Artisan Valuation**
- Billionaire pays 1000x for handmade goods (What does it really do? In the old economic scheme this would make scarce the handmade goods and make the price much higher by the willingness of rich person paying 1000x for it suddenly. Perhaps some run-along effects making it 1100x more expensive. Thus making a profit for the Billionaire. What would it look like in the new model of will-economics? What is it that he intended, when he didn't have to consider everything a stupid 1d gate of money to do things? Perhaps he wanted to facilitate the growingbeds or infrastructure or community that well-suits artisanry and handmade goods. And so, his money is much better spend, trying to make an enchanting world framework of artisanry and leben: To make it "an opportunity" for others to embark upon and try to live it. Then perhaps it wasn't them, perhaps they can't stay in that place because Billionaire doesn't like them, perhaps they leave the place with an appreciation of it, perhaps to the degree of wanting to make "another such place" but where it isn't the same Sovereign (Billionaire who made it possible); But where it is instead themselves or someone else they trust would be that will. Perhaps they wish to make 1000 tiny Triads next to each other and nested in typical fashion next to each other. (How they nest in the Triad could be "None of us above the other. But... We all have some realities to contend with: Like military protection. Like healthcare/sickness-treatment and access to doctors or fire departments and so on. So therefore we need to nest below some Sovereign who provides that. Then find the ones they want to. And yes, it may be the oxymoronic Sovereign or system-as-sovereign" (Though I really do not recommend system-as-sovereign: At least not locally. Too many disputes when you could simply segment it. Rally when possible: If you have no to believe in and trust: "Every man's home is his castle" Own Triad Per House and Property. (You will do what you will do. It is called the Crucible for a reason. We shall see.. It can incorporate ANY system.))))
- Creates economic attractor for craftsmanship (In the old system, it means capital flow to this market, which mean the quality of purchase move from "enjoyers and appreciators" of the artisanry to "economic opportunists" and with that quality of which artisanry goods are demanded change: In particular, the goods that is most economical. That would be something like Artisanry image while being mass-produced. Such as artisan-becoming-"the-designer"-furniture and so on.)
- Mass production becomes less profitable (no. Not in old system. But in new system, IF it actually matters to people, then it can with the weight they want it to. And they'll have a much easier time creating the wealth conditions or circumstances around it to facilitate that way of life too. The way to get others' to will it: Story telling, enchanting world where it is part to the life and way of life there. Which in its most banal and de based form is called PR or advertisement (Which in its de facto form is simply psychological mind-manipulation industry))
- Market reshapes around new values

**Negative Terraforming**:
- Refusing to buy from certain practices (This is the point, holistically speaking with all the impact of an act, will you do it or not. Like getting 10% discount in some goods you have or money (Not necessary but it is a nice psychological effect on people. Number up and down feels good. Power to make happen across my utility domain unto others in a 1d reduction instead of will-economic chains of actions etc.), but then having to give profit and gain to a person who otherwise is impacting the world ENTIRELY contrary to everything else you care about. And so on...)
- Creates economic barriers (Economic barriers is a joke. They do it DIRECT transfer. Not even 2-step transitivity. These systems suggest HOLISTIC WILL-ECONOMIC ANY STEP TRANSITIVITY barriers. Total will-disentanglement is possible. "As if they didn't exist: Out of My Actuality" (This latter form requires Hard-lining others who prove leaky. Depending on the severity of the leak: total cut off or simply higher will-economic leverage in some sense.))
- Harmful practices become unprofitable (Again. What does "profitable" mean? What does practices mean? Any act upon others will have consequences. Positive or negative. As it is in reality. The difference is empowerment to will-manifest (WM) (ultimately) which means will-coaleascence (WE) and will-disentanglement (WD) when talking about other humans and the gradient metricized view of it: Will-economy (WE))
- Market evolution accelerated (Market evolution....)

**Not Control But Influence**:
- Can't force others' values (You can FORCE like States do now, AS SOVEREIGN IN YOUR TRIAD or similar fashion of system-as-sovereign with whatever is the actuator of it (But remember we do not accept run-away matrix like conditions. It will not be acceptable that you make LAWs or Non-Lethal Autonomous Weapons to be the actuators of the system against humans. Any work on Machine conquering man is viewed as extreme threat). There will be routing and "borders" to the degree it is necessary. Though USUALLY it will not because WC and WD and WE. Overtime: Actuality or will-economic consequences become dominated by "spatial sorting". Thus relocating into gradient and thus totally cheapened and relaxed order of the world is simply put: Economical. Will-economical. And if you disagree now. Then you most likely will not later, unless you stand against most of the will in the world at that point. Who like to make room and see the richness without strife and border conflicts and bad harmony bad will-economy between Triads. But there will be, some stubborn "Viggos" I call them: The Road Movie. They will experience something like that. Total will-economic shutoff total will-disentanglement except their stubborn Triad or perhaps even vacated Nation State / Territory Institution that remains. "A King Of No One". Again, If you didn't FEAR that I am right, then you would let me or others TRY something else. Somewhere. Take Denmark, there are PLENTY of unoccupied islands and territory or "ghost towns" where no one enjoys living. Turn it into Triadic zones and WOOPTIE. Then suddenly it will blossom. Or any other land on this godforsaken planet that is standing unused or used for unacceptable conditions of life and existence or external consequence (like rivers in India and China and Philipines and Africa that have helped create the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and supposed contribute with 90% of plastic pollution on the planet))
- Can express own values powerfully (Act by act. Choice by choice. Valuation by valuation. This for that. But all domains. All things we can manage to incorporate in the interaction or trade or act)
- Others freely choose response (Where there is no "freeness to choose" is in the Dominum of something else. There the "dom" part to free-will is had. Triad or Crucible Sovereignty System. Where you can express your free-will that dominates. That says: THIS WAY. And THIS WAY IT WILL BE. That is the power of the Sovereign in a Triad. To allow for the FULL SCOPE OF HUMAN FREEDOM. (MBC corrected and will-economic trade-offs and nesting law: Like that of police, fire department military and so on as I gave example to earlier.))
- Landscape shifts organically

### Professional Services Revolution

**From Credentials to Outcomes**:

**Current System**:
- Lawyer with Harvard JD charges premium
- Doctor with prestigious residency assumed competent
- Engineer with certifications gets hired
- Results disconnected from credentials

**Trust-Utility System**:
- Lawyer ranked by ...  (What does RANKING mean... In a hypersubjective and collective-solved by Trust Networks, PoP, PoU and Triads. What does "a ranking mean" and so what what should we write it is ranked by. Already told you: Will-manifestaion pathfinding or actualizational layer is the way. You get the ranking THAT MATTERS PER PERSON PER CASE)
- Doctor ranked by "patient will-manifestation pathway beliefs by using doctor for some particular Task".
- Engineer ranked by ... 
- Credentials become irrelevant: Indeed. OBSOLETE!

**Market Implications**:
- Village wisdom woman proves-better-pathway-to-will-manifest (Which includes having the father survive cancer; but not at cost of opportunity of a decent life for his children) licensed MD (Who has a 10x parasites on him and profitteers extracting immense wealth from everything from machines, medication!!!!, buildings, staff, administrators, conglomerate and all its employees and other branching of revenue from the hospital into other streams of money spending; as well as the probably heavily overpriced doctor who is made artifically scarce by making the entry to helping other persons be OUTLAWED and 10 YEARS OF $2e6 SPENT ON EDUCATION AND SO ON.)
- Self-taught coder outperforms PhD (Which is quite common; If you're really good; you don't need to go to school and get a stamp. In fact IT MIGHT BE INTELLECTUALLY INSULTING TO GO THROUGH THE SCHOOLING.)
- Experienced parent outranks child psychologist (What a surprise! It isn't a select few persons on the planet with "an education" who will be able to solve the particular psychological conumdrum or conditions that makes them have such issues: But rather a few or some from the many of all the persons on the planet (General Pathfinding hint.) AND the conditions under which they will THRIVE can be HAD by Will-coalescence, will-disentanglement and Triad SOVEREIGNTY and FACILITATION to forge THEIR WORLD; ESPECIALLY WITH BORDERS/GRADIENT-WD-WE-WC THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE WITHOUT THOSE THAT RUIN IT FOR THEM! That makes them feel WRONG or UNCOMFORTABLE or UNEASED or SELF-CONSCIOUS or demands of them to do things they can't do or function in. Or whatever it may be. Then on top of that: Once the brood is out of their neck, then: WC or coming together of ONLY those that REALLY heighten it: But with match making IN DEPTH and on their total real-time WM or WE viewpoints. And with GROWING plurality across the globe with hundred thousands or MILLIONS of Triads coming, dwindling and going as time passes on; And like the NSS Variant Mutations: So too THEY STAY in abstraction and remembrance able to be PROJECTED ONTO EARTH once again if they become "the pathfinding solution" that someone chooses to embark upon.)
- Subjective-Merit emerges from WM results

### Dynamic Pricing and Value Flow

**Real-Time Value Expression**:
- Urgent need increases personal value
- Abundance decreases scarcity which allows for easier WM concerning that which is in abundance. But headlessly maximizing abundance means scarcity of that which is without it or alternative-use of the matter or the world or time spent by the person or ingestion of it and so on. So saying "Abundance is good" simply doesn't account for all the interesting aspects of what Abundance Means. Like "Abundance of Plastic" or "Abundance of 'housing'" When it means communist-capitalist-economic-bauhaus-homogenenized-across-all-the-world-making-all-the-world-without-escape-from-the-abundance. Or let's say "Abundance of straw shorteners in all your wheat" or "abundance of glyphosate" because "abundance of wheat was good" and "abundance of sugary transfat food was massive supplied and offered as alternative in any situation to anyone no matter where they are or how pathological that environment is to them". And so on. And so on. With Triads we get plurality of these things. Which mean there will be in Actualizational Layer clear Pathways of trying to be accepted into a Triad or going to Triad you're already in (Like let's say sea or ocean or whatever); where the environment is vastly superiorly aligned towards your holistic will. The Will-economics becomes almost zero. Or without cost. Everything already IS the way that helps you maximally towards your will. And such things. But this is prevented now, by capital or communist for that matter vast domination of anti-domination across the globe: Or LIBERALISM (And in part human rights. But human rights is as usually retarded. They try to make a MBC++ But they don't realize the fault in applying it to those fundamentally moving the world towards a better state in relation to their very own valuations or intent of the human rights: Because "Law must be had equally upon all; In some silly expert system valuation of whether things are equal or not: 'Well, if it is within these 10 categories/projections we are allowed to look at, THEN it is the same, THEN we have to judge it EQUALLY'" (There simply isn't much to do about this. Other than this: Stop hitting everyone with it. Focus on the Worst First: Globally but rather Actually Realizable in impact. And Let's put it this way: You prevent "good stuff" and you're "the bad guy" to those who deem it "good stuff". Simply as that.(So, Sovereignty DOMINATION "human rights abuse!!!" or "authoritarianism! DANGER!" then vermin serpentine snakes finding utility in your voice: "ATTACK THEM! BOMB THEM!" Or whatever else you might choose to say: Enemy. (MBC is your supersedent of the Planetary attempt. You can try to make your own. But beyond that it is Nesting at will. But with REAL HUMAN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR THRIVING AND WILL AND EMOTION AND INTENT AND ...................)))).
- Trust relationships affect "pricing" (You get it now? How outdated that terminology is. Trust Networks is foundation that offers information intelligence and more to an individual without having to have a three letter agency with them or large bureaucratic agencies. But instead p2p solution to all of it. Empowered by these systems. Trust in the sense of Trust Networks has a consequence on beliefs and therefore computation of pathfinding to WM. But also beliefs about trusting another to do a task with all the contextual constraints (like privacy) obviously also affect the computation whether or not that trade/act is amongst good candidates of movements to WM. Or if flipped around and insisting that one make the multiple choices of possible acts to do one-self, then have the WE ranking of each show very different realities depending on all sorts of beliefs or knowledge that can be inferred about "it all" and "the interactor")
- Context determines everything: Yes, because the world isn't our mountainridge talk with oblivion on either side. It is deep sentience of the many parts to us at the same time: All the things we can see - or at least feel while we focus on the mountainridge - all around us towards the horizon: As well as all the things that came before. So, a phrase is nothing. It could mean almost anything. Depending on Context. Ass.

**Old-World weirdness of mercenary corrupted metrics: Multi-Currency Systems**:
- Money for impersonal exchange (I don't understand it)
- Trust scores for reputation currency (I don't understand it)
- Time banking for community exchange (I don't understand it)
- Barter for direct value swap (I don't understand it)
- Gift economy for relationship building (I don't understand it)

**New-World: Multi-Will-Economics Clusters**:
- Tinker Bell is King.
- If it matters to you: It matters.
- If it matters to many of you: WC and with that extreme Leverage to WD.
- If it matters to you alone against all other importance in the world: You can always make your own Triad and have it EXACTLY YOUR WAY without the domination from other persons by mutually-exclusive-will that unfolds when we have to cooperate, interact and ...
- This causes any degree of will-economic isolation by simply making things so much against your will that it is unacceptable: All the way to the point of saying "Fuck you all. I'm going to my own Triad without any nesting at all other than that which became Planetary or others' willing so much they couldn't resolve it with MIRA or Meta-gaming of World Dynamics; and so decided to destroy me. That degree of nesting: But only that degree". Is the degree to which you can disentangle yourself from others and their oppression/domination. But, insofar, you don't want to be all alone, then some sort of will-economic considerations must be had. Where it isn't your will alone, but will-with-will over time, and initially it is mostly: Will-against-will. Because of chaos entropy philosophies. Like Liberalism, Communism, Capitalism and so on. (But these systems TRIES to not only solve will-against-will in the long term. But also very much vent the pressure acutely. If territory institutions FUCK OFF, then suddenly opportunity can be had by mere subsistence level funding. Which, again, a tiny country like Denmark could if they discarded their current system fund the world in making Triads. (It would STILL need the release of territory and perhaps even vacating sometimes by persons in space around the planet or "at least somewhere" that is WE in relation to WM you try to solve. Or the WC & WD that is had by it.))

### Market Topology and Navigation

**Markets as Landscapes**:
- Hills where value concentrates
- Valleys of low activity
- Rivers of flowing exchange
- Bridges between different economies\*\* (Will-coalescence zones; but otherwise yes it is very apt. It is the coming together and making high-density of will-with-will in depth of that will and being all things considered (If it matters to you it matters) that will make these spacetime pockets of "economies")

**AR Market Visualization**:
- See value gradients in space
- Trust territories mapped
- Opportunity flows visible
- Will-Economic weather patterns (Like that of WD being upset. Then with the consequence "flight" movements; or else "towards The Road" impositions or leverage; amongst other things. The avoidance or avoiding. The new roads or exclusion.)

### The End of Advertisement

**Current Deception Model**:
- Manipulate through imagery (Imagination instead of imaginary. Story telling, enchanting, coming together, manifesting and reaping the fruits of the reality of it: Instead of Public Relations or Propaganda. Then instead of Advertisement: Actualizational Layer (Will Pathfinding))
- Hide true product nature (Hide: Multi-Will-Economies consequences. Trust Networks. When you're deceitful, it may be very important to some persons and how they would henceforth treat you or interact with you, And crucially: Believe you and find computational verified good candidate to WM what they want (And perhaps some character virtue stuff and not wanting to deal with such persons in general. Not wanting to feed them to screw over others another time))
- Create false associations (Eat these supplements and compensate for your genetics! (Despite being well-nourished; Almost ALL supplements have effects SOLELY on malnourished subset of the cohort; Including things like protein loading and so on. You synthesize protein. But if you have a defect in being able to synthesize protein well. Then eating large quantities will have an effect. And this is doubly the effect because it is like fat burning: A pathway that is built up with enzymatic and generative cells of the enzymes over time as it is needed. But do a simple study and yes: You will find that protein-under-synthesizing persons will get a slight increase in protein available for muscle growth (Essential acids too. But they are variant across humanity what amino acid is essential or none at all) (You end up with things like: Oh I will buy this chicken meat because I need the protein. Despite thinking about what it means in terms of demanding the killing of birds reared in the manner you imagine. (Me in 2016: Slight protein or body optimization; At the cost of hell conjuring on earth. WHO KNOWS IF IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE? (IT WAS NOT. DELUSIONAL COPING. Rationalizing away something I wanted to do, with some sort of self-importance (That tiny increases in my somatic condition in relation to "mate-finding" or VANITY would justify it) and lying about the conditions of the hellscape I demand conjured)) Or later in 2019-2023: DOOM AND DEATH TO EVERYTHING. Including most Animals and everything.)))
- Prevent real comparison (All things considered: Which is mostly made hyper retarded by having positioned Infrastructure for products and consumers as adversaries and enemies. (That also try to extract as much information as they can from you in order to exploit you. Manipulate you. Politically. Consumer wise. Every which way. Fetishes. And so on.) Whereas: Infrastructure can be HAD by the consumer or Trusted( BUT THEN ACTUALLY TRUSTED! (Trust Networks) Not merely "Flag Cover Says Denmark Institution" or "Says large company like AWS or Google. So why should I!!! Not trust them") or Trustless ), with real accountability PoP etc. Where they can Trust their information they share with machine is theirs. (Imagine Iron-Man talking to Jarvis constantly but not daring say anything personal to it. It is absolutely insane. Jarvis becomes a menance to Iron-man. Having to constantly think about what he says as there is an AI system observing him. WHEREAS: If you FLIP IT and give ALL THE TRUST TO THEM WHOEVER THEY ARE. But try to FACILITATE IT HAPPENING FOR ANY TRUST NETWORK. Then! They can all become SMARTER and more in tune with their will and how to make it manifest. Which as I said: In the context of this system: Means helping your enemy do this, means you can DISENTANGLE from him. (Metagame of World Dynamics when you can't. MIRA when you can't do Metagame of World Dynamics.))

**Trust Network Alternative**:
- Actual user experiences shared (But shared not in the shallow sense. But due to the discussion about Jarvis and Jarvis doing the computer-speed guiding of experience information all things consider. In a DEEP sense.)
- Real outcomes tracked (Real-time not a single test. But continual, always testing or obversing. What is the case. (Of course some things like blood work and other things are with greater interval between tests (But probably blood work will not be needed, because they too, are shallow things, and the implicit learning from "bad -> better (all things considered)" accounts for ALSO the things that a blood-test would try to be proxy for or sometimes prove (Like, a pathogen or something))))
- Externalities visible (This is not "externalities" butterfly effect says externalities of anything is everything. But the predictable, sizable impacts of all those things that mattered to you, matter to you or perhaps would matter to you if you knew about them. This is the fun game one has with one's Aiddaemon/Jarvis :P)
- Honest comparison possible (Comparison almost unnecessary: Because simply WM. It doesn't matter what in relation to other. Because you're busy WM. With WC and WD. You LIVE and MANIFEST. You don't sit around googling with gooey eyes others.)

### Eliminating Market Gatekeepers

**Current Gatekeepers**:
- Amazon controlling online retail (It is basically one of many many market "viewpoints" that all had a tiny slice of some market present. This was annoying for consumer. So they gravitate towards a few that are useful -- this happens with many all at once, but the ones that get more, get better, the ones who land better supplier deals grow more, the ones that have more demanders or users, get more suppliers (all because they all ask for money and so they don't do it everywhere or they have exclusivity clauses to the infrastructure they're supplied upon). Some of these become lucky. They then grow. And with growth, due to their parasitism-to-be-determined eating, they expand and aggressively buy up everything in their way or simply replicate products of trouble others. Then use all the other avenues to position themselves firmly as the sole or one of the few viewpoint into the market. This allows them to have a sort of monopoly angle where they can leech with their Private_VAT to profit without end or any accountability to having added another parasitic burden to the population.)
- Google controlling discovery (Basically, the market. The Man in the Middle between a person and the market or information to a pretty large extend. As well as owner of the services in which you store much of your information. But you "Trust Them" or simply don't have any alternative because all these factors work together to prevent any alternatives to become useful (Many persons using them (what the users care about usually. Which they don't make. They only facilitate and became the facilitator not because they were the better or only ones. But because they used the mechanisms described in these papers across domains of power) and easy enough for consumer to switch to). And that includes governments and states simply being lobbied and have propaganda bubbles erected around them to make law that simply crushes alternatives. And the same happens with intelligence and military too. They too get propaganda bubbles around them. Often from within. That makes them attack or frame things in ways that makes alternatives "dangerous" and in need of being "crushed" or "thwarted" or something.)
- Banks controlling in-advance-money-flow (Or investment at large (it includes lending money (Investing civilizationally in the person borrowing that his money is the right thing to premature grant grants for)) and it includes usury (investment that the borrowing person will pay interest upon the loan at a slow rate (market stability assumption (bad assumption)) to maximize profits) and things like investment banks who then also do loans to "industrial endeavours" (in theory or utopian delusion)), as well as payments (stripe etc), as well as money-supply inflation (Fed and interbanking loans), inflation at large (distribution to which demand base and defaulting of loans on which supply or granting of loans (in-advance-money) to which supplier- or demander-wannabes (Say loan to a energy drink company or loan for a yacht or large wedding))
- Platforms taking percentages (They all function like this: They see a stratified infrastructure market. That heavily is dependent on the qualities of content and quantity of it. Then they manage to capture essential qualities and quantities to their infrastructure "content-delivery". Then the monopoly effect arises. Then they never relinquish or think responsibly or with accountability about their parasitic burden they have then incurred upon the world. Now the oppressive and dominating aspects to how they wield their power while in that position. (Entire Silicon Valley are rich because of this. There have been local versions of everything they've done. Usually before them and usually better than them. But they win because of exactly that mechanism. They use every trick across all domains of power they can to establish themselves as that "infrastructure" in the digital for all human interaction with that infrastructure. And these systems replace them 100% (And We ONLY have to AGREE AS NORMAL PEOPLE TO SWITCH ONCE....... To the non-parasitic version. There will be 0 monetary gain had in making these systems and the supplying is internal economically solved. So, it takes the market ONLY ONE TIME to do this "demand terraforming" to a new setting. Say in terms of "carbon" or "animal welfare" or "human rights" or whatever else you care about. It will only have to happen ONCE this time. Then after that THEY ARE GONE. And one is ABLE to go without majority or all to have leverage and effect. Then the systematic consequences will unfold that will allow for these things to be terraformed at human will. Instead of gamed positions, property right domination, zero-sum position, lawfare and state bullshit one can't escape and where a few gets to impose massive will without having any REAL leverage or merit to back it up. But rather have simply found themselves in positions to take advantage of it and so they do in the manner befitting to them and their character. Which will have DIRECT consequences and accountability in the system that has to be switched to ONLY ONE TIME. New IT Tech Stack. THEN it is over.)))

**Direct Exchange Enablement**:
- Producer to consumer directly (prosumer or conducer :P It isn't as one-way in the new system)
- Discovery through trust networks (Intelligence through it. Largely. Because we don't live in kumbaya world with objective reality all agree upon and everyone being "rational agents" and so on.)
- Payment through chosen systems ("through" will-economic ANY DOMAIN and so "through" ???? Whatever cross-domain divesting and vesting with acts between that allow for will-equilibrium concerning the matter to be had)
- No mandatory intermediaries (In fact, intermediaries is also obsolete. Trust Network and Multaiddaemon and Triads are ALL collective systems you need. The rest is You and Your Aiddaemon: Daiddaemon. Going about in a world of million-fold opportunities and richness. (And again................... .Not saying REVOLUTION! I am saying: LET US TRY AT LEAST ONE PLACE. Then I bet my ways will swallow the world. Where your ways will be stubbornly held by a few. With whatever consequences that will have Will-economically speaking.))

### Gift Economies and Hybrid Systems

**Beyond Pure Transaction**:
- Gift economies build relationships ("It is my will to please you or take care of you or ... ... " These sorts of things. "To be nice to you". And so on. When it is holistically your will. And you're not necessitated to deal with the established structures of corporations and powers that currently is. But can instead simply be facilitated in whatever WM you have. Then what are they there for? They aren't there for anything at all. They will crumble and fall away. They want efficient economies. They want responsiveness. Okay. Well HERE YOU HAVE IT. Raw WM. Raw WE. Raw WC. That faciliitates "products" when they are demanded and with the forethought that the world-will or those that can will (I talked about the ARK project. Instead of doing Mars suvival in kind. Then do some massive ARK project on the planet that functions AS IF we could magically transport humanity to Mars, i.e.: Biodome survival even if earth climate goes totally awry for human survival. (Now, World can will it. And make choices every day towards it, orthogonal to it, or against it. But also "those that can" can will it. And simply make it happen. "You can't make the world do what you want. But you can make what the world will need from doing what they want" (Then you can call that HYPER LONG TERM investment strategies (WE ownership of ARK upon human-survivability conditions (Not that it will last: Think snowpiercer versus The Passengers and so on. It all depends on so much whether such ideas of Ownership or reality of Pwnership is had))))))
- Sharing economies reduce waste (efficient economies reduce waste inherently. But the current system is highly inefficient (I have pointed out several reasons why (non-exhaustively pointed things out)). Also: Trust enables many things. Also: Pathfinding reduces or destroys most things that prevent pathfinding... Like regulation. Or Obsolete Systems.)
- Hybrid trades with currency/money (universal token feel good bananacoins) and cross-domain WC to mutual-WM emerge naturally and with gradient according to the intertrading persons and their ability to find alternative paths towards WM. (Which is highly dependent on things like Trust Network beliefs and personal interlocking against each other; as well as physical reality: Triad Crucible Solution Nesting Sovereignty)

**Trust Enables Gifting**:
- Know gift will be appreciated (And what does it usually have of consequences to gift someone something then not having it reciprocated or betrayed afterwards: It changes the Will in relation to that other person. Which is then actuable due to "these systems".)
- Understand recipient's needs (Like not feeling Wrong. Like being 5'9" tall in a world where most men out in the open are 6'3" and trying to hook up or be peacock-sexually attractive and make others feel inferior constantly. Aka. Will-disentanglement of "hobbit" (In any dimension or domain) from those others who are "giants" as to enable them to have social or sexual stability without "invasive species"; Who may or may not be "superior" on account of their "height" or "giantism" (Your perception of beauty or value or worth. You decide System is amoral (But I suggest MBC planetary and opiniate sometimes: Especially about what is replaced.)))
- Build long-term reciprocity (This is tit-for-tat across Trust Networks. Which allows snakes-oil salesman to only go for as long as he can avoid the information flow through Trusted Nodes.)
- Create community wealth (This is in general a thing that this world lacks. Almost all money is "faux-community" pooled into "profit seeking organization" without any aligning WM vision. Which allows for it to be dispersed into the winds at the whim of those shadowy persons who end up deciding what the actual hoarded wealth should be spent upon. Whether banks or states or insurance or anything else.)

### Critical Market Principles

**No Objective Value**: Everything subjective to the valuer (Ultimately yes)
**Trust Filters Everything**: Bad actors naturally excluded (And this can very quickly grow massively to immense intelligence service and thus WE adjustments towards some WM. As well as Multaiddaemon and other things facilitating privacy at collective orchestration scales. As well as Trustless gossiping about WC WD etc. (Like normal advertisement of such things work now: Mostly (People don't think about who says what will happen where. They usually simply go with it. Believe it.)))
**Information Flows Freely**: Collective intelligence emerges (When human will can find will-economic pathways, then it becomes very intelligent looking. When Aiddaemonic pre-simulation allows for scenarios having been tested out preemptively prior to manifestation. When massive convergence of acts to happen build and become. Then it seems massively intelligent. When intent and manifestation become coupled. When redundancy is had on REAL lines of human and physical constraints instead of imaginary economic happenstance. Then it will seem VERY intelligent.)
**Multiple Currencies Welcome**: Value expressed many ways (You're free to make your own tokens or currencies. It feels nice to have a metric and some act you can do for others that grants you some measurable accumulation. As an example Strata and PoP PoUWitness and more will have such token accumulation. Also many LLL games will have the former as a foundation to playing the games as well as internal game tokens. And Trust Networking and many many other things could have such tokens as well. Some measurable sensation. Like some Trust Network establishes their internal token or currency to book-keep indebtedness ("Aiddaemon. Spin up a Multaiddaemon for these PoP that will become this currency-sharing Trust Network/Graph. Whenever we have tasks to do. Like some intelligence work or ensuring of some things to allow for answering a question we want. We use this internally to bookkeep. So, make that visible in whenever I go into that mode" (Or something like it.)) But again, you don't need it, you can have it all exist latently in the background of your general Will and not book keep things like that: Or if you do, in more will-economic manner. Then simply focus on WM. Or building an awesome Triad that others you would want would want to rally to. Then all this indebtedness isn't that important. With the Triads you get control to say "banish" persons or whatever other Sovereign control that states now have. And, so to have substratum rally and come and really invest in your triad. Some guarantees often need to be had: Like not going empty handed therefrom. And the way this works is often by the nesting structure and the sovereign you rally under is subsovereign or subject to another while being superject still. Then, disagreement on those lines are met with the above. That is ultimately: the system can handle most of these things, merely by will-economy, PoP, Trust Network and the consequences of having the leverage of massive world-will against them. So, if one treats another really poorly: It has consequences. It isn't a problem with Triads being problems like that: Because current wealth is puny and Triads are small surrounded by Sea or Ocean Triads which are much more open and can allow for new smaller Triads to be made within , insofar it matches the Routing or Vision of that Triad and its Sovereign (Person or system-as-sovereign))
**Direct Exchange Preferred**: Intermediaries must add value (Intermediaries that isn't a direct part to the act: Are unneccesary and will be obsolete. That is all third-party profitting will go away from acts. There will not be a wedge to substract wealth from it. (Other than PoU Strata). But, are you part to the pathfinding of "vegan-burrito in sofa now!!!!" Then of course that's an intermediary but part to the act of "vegan-burrito in sofa now!!!!" (NOOOO!!! HE SAID VEGAN! THAT IS CRINGE OTHER TRIBE SOY BOYS! I NEED TO BE STRONG MAN! AND KILL INNOCENT ANIMALS IN HELLSCAPE CONJURED CONDITIONS!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! (Sorta like that I was xD (Joking. But not really. RAWWWRRR DEATH AND DOOM TO THE WORLD!!! Strong Man! CAN AT LEAST DESTROY WHEN HE CAN'T FIX.))))

### The Abundant Market Future

When markets reach trust maturity:
- Every exchange creates mutual benefit (In massive degree. Across many domains at once. Across many different timescales at once. Towards many different Will/Intents of each person partaking in the "high density will-Economies")
- Deception becomes impossible
- Value flows to real utility
- Innovation rewards increase
- VISION and DREAMING MINDSET PREVAILS. Dream World Manifest!

Not through regulation but through visibility or the many things made opaque all at once. Not through standardization but through diversity and experimentation: Real world manifestation and each and every person own individual attitude towards these things that then has become. Not through control but through free choice informed by trust. (Unless Triad Crucible. And yes you can TRY Polymorphic Crucible WITHOUT the territorial nesting dynamics. But then you only get one-shot at the governance structure and have to rely it all on the other parts to the system. Say, you may be inclined to state: One massive Planetary or World or Ocean structure that has these and those rules. But then otherwise all within is free-roam and only functioning on the other parts to the system. No sovereigns or anything else. And while this is okay. Perhaps you will find it necessary to state hardlines of owning some space on the planet to have it YOUR WILL without any other will against you. Exactly your vision. Exactly you dream. For most persons: Having your dream or vision is about WC and WD. Which can be had by one Ocean rule: If you actively try to ruin WD effects then you're banished from the zone. But otherwise "dream on". That causes a massive zone where "your will and your dream" is WC in spacetime when it can. But no territorial binding at all or building of a space as "yours exclusively" or "your land" or "your/someone-particular sovereignty". But again, all of these alternatives are merely that: Alternatives. And World-will, YOUR WILL or Will-Economics will have it be what it will be. We shall see. All I ask for .........)

The market becomes a space where:
- Your grandmother's cookies find their true valuers
- Artisans connect with those who appreciate craft
- Healers meet those needing their specific gift
- Everyone finds their economic resonance

This is economics returning to its root: the management of home/dominum, the care of community, the facilitation of human flourishing through exchange. The management of order within a Dominum (Triad).

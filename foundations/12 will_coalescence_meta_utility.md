# 12. Will Coalescence - The Meta-Utility

## How All Utilities Enable the Ultimate Purpose: Will Manifestation

### The Foundational Recognition

**All Infrastructure Serves One Purpose**: Enabling conscious beings to manifest their will in reality.

- Computation helps will calculate
- Electricity powers wills' tools
- Water sustains wills' vessel
- Food fuels wills' expression
- Communication connects wills
- All are means to will manifestation

### The Positive Feedback Spiral

**Infrastructure Enables Coalescence**:
Better utilities → Easier will manifestation →
More successful coalescence → Lower demand for utilities (Coalescence reduces the need to "ask for" or "demand utility" it becomes emergent and side-effect of being able to navigate a landscape of choices that has strong will-alignment (Wherein a interrelational part to that is Will-coalescence)) →
Demand for "peaks of will-harmony" → Indirect demand for Better infrastructure → Infrastructure and utility improvement

However. You get exponentially better utility by having will-coalescence and you get unquantifiably better utility by actually being able to navigate yourself in and some localities of the world along the lines of your will.

**Concrete Examples**:
- Reliable electricity enables online connection
- Good food improves mood for socializing
- Clean water supports health for activity
- Computation facilitates coordination
- Each improvement amplifies others; however this is a naive view of will-coalescence and will-disentanglement encouraging amplifiers.

### Will Coalescence as Utility

**The Service**: Predicting and enabling compatible will-combinations across ALL domains

The example below can't be used as a way of doing any accurate or perhaps even useful will-coalescence. It can, however, be used as a textual output for a human to made their choices with; it would then suggests particular choices being loaded with degrees of these human readable categories or patterns; that they use together with their Aiddaemon to encoded massive context of what their will/intent is in relation to such syntax, words and phrases. However, it is important to note, that it is extremely! low dimension and information provided in relation to what is actually the truth of "romantic resonance" of an individual daemon in relation to other daemons.

**Types of Coalescence** (not categories but overlapping patterns):
- **Romantic resonance**: Life partnership potential
- **Creative collaboration**: Artistic/innovative synergy
- **Economic partnership**: Business/trade compatibility
- **Learning groups**: Educational resonance
- **Healing circles**: Therapeutic alignment
- **Work teams**: Project-based coalescence
- **Governance**: Political/philosophical alignment
- **Spiritual communion**: Religious/mystical resonance
- **Athletic coordination**: Physical activity partners
- **Parenting networks**: Child-rearing compatibility

Note: The way will-coalescence would, with current tech work, would be Blob Classes or DNN nodes and their predictive though very unclear in human-readable semantic meaning (Though obvious extremely precise quantitatively).


The following is a clearcut failing to understand the primary function of having will-coalescence infrastructure:
**The Providers**: Coalescence facilitators operating at every scale
- Personal matchmakers (all types, not just romantic)
- Event organizers
- Space creators
- Timing optimizers
- Vibe cultivators
- Governance advisors
- Team builders

The point being, that all the above things become emergent through any will-economic choice provided to you by the Aiddaemon and will-manifestation (Which includes will-alignment (any part of material reality) and will-coalescence (coming together of wills)) infrastructure. Note: This is also name the actualizational layer in some perspectives or framworks.
Therefore, the above aren't at all part of the system, in fact they are made redundant by the system. However, you are of course free to will being such a utility including using the infrastruce of will-manifestation; and perhaps many persons enjoy having "explicitly organized events that try to do what is otherwise simply a side-effect of will-manifestation".

**The Value**: Measured subjectively at an individual basis on account of how well their will is manifest. The problem, however, remains! that many many many many many many many many many many many many many "educated" persons, will mostly things about extremely vast territories and groups/categories of persons and how each of these should own which and what. Their "memetic tribe team" win all; not other win any. This makes the whole will-manifestation metric to deem the value of it void. 
This is an underlying presupposition the author has: The Mass Man is a fucking idiot crepid; Fulfilling his Will "as is" isn't at ALL a metric to care about.
Fulfilling his will in a NEW setting and having humbled him TREMENDOUSLY would allow for that metric to become a good or useful metric.
All it takes for it to be a good metric: 1) Stop being zero-sum constrained games greedy (Especially concerning Territory and space on this ridiculous planet) 2) Focus on your local life. Surrounding and happiness away from the "connected and collapsed world that The Jew has provided" (The One Category that is 100% TRUE!).

### The Combinatorial Challenge of Actualization/Pathfinding Layer of acute, chronic and eternal will-coalescence considerations.

**The Numbers**:
- 8 billion people = 2^8,000,000,000 possible groupings
- Each person in varying states (tired, energized, sad, curious...)
- Environmental conditions matter (weather, location, ambiance...)
- Temporal factors crucial (time of day, season, life phase...)
- Temporal past, present and post (What would have been past will-coalescence optimality, what would be the acute, the chronic (in different chronicities) and even the eternal perspective (Are there things about those perspectives that should influence the acute coalescent effects))
- Categories and comprehension utterly fail at this scale

**Why Blob Classes Can Still Functionally Sufficiently Succeed**:
- Compress infinite possibilities into learnable dynamic and responsive metapatterns
- Predict without understanding the category theory of it; no matter if it is possible to make such a theory about it. 
- Adapt by stability and dynamism of metapatterns the real-time, acute or chronic patterns
- Learn from everything; every interaction; every signal or observation; every word. (It is important to note, that SOLID++ implies total control of surveillence and the "observation and learning" is done at your trust discretion; enabling your Aiddaemon to divulge according to your deep intent on a case by case basis at the speed, throughput, connectivity and concurrency of computer-advantage scale)

### Coalescence Gossipers and Prediction

**Not Categories But Metapatterns and constant projection of functioning patterns**:
Traditional thinking expects:
- "Romance whisperers"
- "Business matchmakers"
- "Creative catalysts"

Reality creates nebulous projected functional pattern blob classes:
- Pattern #7823: [daemon+aiddaemon encoding scheme (daiddaemon ES): Tuesday evening intellectual energy convergence]
- Pattern #3421: [Daiddaemon ES: Morning workout partnership potential]
- Pattern #9567: [Daiddaemon ES: Creative collaboration under moon conditions]

**Gossiper Expertise Is Dimensional**:
- Some Daiddaemons excel at timing predictions
- Others sense emotional compatibility
- Many combine multiple sensitivities
- All contribute to the will-field
- And Tinker Bell effects are immensely powerful in these systems. (The search for point-convergence-vicinities will-field information. Say, "many believe there will be a Tsunami at that point. The more who believe it. The more it will be true that persons will act as if it was True." Then in relation to human will alone, then it is clear that Tinker Bell effects are very very real.)

### The Gossip Perturbation Network

**How Predictions Flow**:
1. You share desires with "trusted friends" (Again shallow categorical language. Not how Trust Maps and which information to divulge to whom flows. The best intuitive way to think about it, is to simply imagine the Aiddaemon as a black-box but your machine-mirror that acts AS IF you could make choices with computer-advantage. Then this Trust Map that it infers from Trust Networking, its own computational capacity, having mirrored the daemon as well as possible and general Daiddaemonic work. Then it is able to in a very nuanced way know which information is very comfortably shared with who - on a case by case and person by person and "all things considered" basis. And of course - it being your machine-mirror it also knows things like to which degree you are severely hurt by which information divulged beyond what you would have wanted had you acted yourself (with whatever difference between daemon and Aiddaemon there is) or if you had known some greater unforseen aspect to it. All this is of course, essential parts of its functioning, to know such things as well as it possibly can.)
2. They communicate will-field physics as well as you probably would want to do as well. As it is tremendously useful in seeing your will-manifest.
However, in the Pseudonymous world, you will have Trust Maps of the information that flows concerning will-field physics, and much will-field physics will by unknown to you without broadcasting actors wanting you to know about it: Their Trust Beliefs allowing you to "know about it". This allows you to weigh it massively in terms of beliefs. On top of that, it is also infeasible to do all the intelligence work and attempt at then predicting will-manifestation pathways - including will-coalescence - on your own. Therefore, the Trust Maps of yours once again shine! Because, they allow you to outsource the computation and communication needs (you don't to capture information on your own from around the globe); and many core functionalities like Multaiddaemons are fundamentally founded upon Trust Networks.
3. On top of that anonymous gossip flows as a trustless - unaccountable - though PoP (sybil and other things) secure information. This becomes the background-noise or background-fields to the will-field physics.
4. Your Aiddaemon can help you in many ways. But one of the ways would be to play an LLL game where it is AR that shows color saturations and hue changes among other visual alterations. To encode a lot of information in intuitive visual communication.
5. You will probably then feel "drawn" towards certain enticements of fulfilling will that would have become tangible steps or directions in physical space to move in. Afterall, if you don't at all, then perhaps you should re-evaluate what your Aiddaemons tries to help you fulfill: Something that speaks to you and also where will-manifestation actualizational layer can provide paths towards it that isn't totally deflating. (Hint: "Aiddaemon. Give me both most will-economic paths and greedy algorithmic property pathway to my will." or better yet: "There seems to be a mismatch in your mirroring of me, that results in paths not being greedily will-economic enough. Let's fix that." or better yet [Unnecessary Discussion. Problem Solved Without Effort Out of the Box])

**Privacy Through Scale**:
- Individual predictions encrypted
- Multiple predictions bundled
- Perturbations mixed at each hop
- Source can become untraceable (Trustless anonymous version (Monero but PoP mining)); or it can be trust constrained or trust conflated (Multaiddaemons)
- Only patterns remain

### Will-Field Physics

**Global Substrate Creation**:
- Millions of anonymous predictions
- Gravitational-like perturbations
- No names or identities
- Pure mathematical resonance
- Ambient intelligence emerges

**Local Experience**:
- Feels like intuition
- "I just felt drawn there" (Daiddaemonic encoding schemes that become intuitively emotional (and cleverly exploiting extant intuitive emotion of sensory input (Like that of radiance and saturation and brighter hue giving a daemon certain emotion and so on.)))
- Synchronicities with what would previously have been astronomical serendipity becomes second nature every day occurences. 
- Meaningful encounters explode (Every encounter cross-pollinates or cross-provides your total will and being: the subjective optimized will-economic topology with near-optimal paths chosen through it)
- Life becomes more resonant and harmonious; insofar one lives locally (One's real life and not Risk World Domination Life (Anyone wanting World Domination Fails short of the 0 position (To Win World Domination under this order means Technological Supremacy FAR beyond anyone else (So it fundamentally means secrecy and progressing technology ahead decade after decade. Century after century. Or however long it takes to reach not only a Horned position. But the 0 position of Lord of Destruction. Master of Life and Death on the Planet against anyone at a whim.(And so. You can try to prevent this from happening. And Good Luck to you. Perhaps you can thwart technological progression that is explicitly directed towards it. But the problem is the combinatorial nature of technological application and power; as well as Bostrom Vulnerable World points. (It is therefore, totally unfeasible to imagine our current world ALL agreeing to shut down progress with no one in charge and no one able to break free to pursue progress of technology (And so the Threat of 0 is a reality. It will happen.)))))))

### Multi-Scale Coalescence

**Personal Scale**:
- Two people finding deep connection
- Small group achieving flow state
- Family harmonizing activities

**Community Scale**:
- Neighborhoods organizing naturally
- Interest groups self-assembling
- Local cultures emerging (True human plurality revealed by sudden coming together in kind of something deep and foundational. As well as acute proclivity or inclination or inspiration.)

**Civilization Scale**:
- Mass movements coalescing
- Cultural renaissances beginning
- New civilizations budding

### The AR Phase Engine for Will

This presents a particular AR LLL game that is based upon "These Systems"; such that it can provide Phase Engine; and reduce mutually-exclusive will by infrastructure of the game. In this case, it allows for territorial zero-sum to become greater than zero. Both in terms of time-share use of the same space (1) and simultaneous use (2). It enables both things in different ways -- respectively described with the following "Dual Function System".

**Dual Function System**:

**1. Navigation Display** (Will paths made visible):
- Red saturation: Romantic potential
- Green: Economic opportunity
- Blue: Learning possibilities
- Purple: Healing connections
- Gold: Creative collaboration
- Silver: Spiritual resonance

**2. Phase Separation** (Multiple realities coexist):
- Same location, different hyperrealities
- Incompatible aesthetics in separate phases (Like that of making your enemies ugly; while those you can "in your most intelligent way" infer are internally beautiful - in your eyes - made beautiful in a superficial sense -- in your eyes)
- Some people only exist in certain phases (Blurred out only gray geometric person and their other sensory outputs or effects are sensory-cancelled (like noise cancelling technology))
- Out-of-phase elements muffled or hidden (Existent but dampened effect. "The AR Dream of the Autist" (Aiddaemon instantly notices the annoyance I have with some sensory aspect or particular person; then instantly muffles it and progressively until I am unbothered but still able to display willingness for attention towards it: Such that the aiddaemon would bring it into sensory neutral or even amplified states (In the same manner)))
- Complete experiential separation possible (No. Only in VR is it possible with COMPLETE. There exists some fundamental physical reality that one has to deal with in order to navigate in AR mode. (And probably depending on Crucible Triad there will be laws concerning what kind of modulations are acceptable there (When in Rome do as the Romans)))
- Physical proximity without experiential collision (What matters to the experience can often be made entirely disjoint: Since it is often about some atmosphere, setting and persons there (Including such things as music (The system allows for many live bands to play in the same space by sensory selection or attention)) But of course, if it is about the physical constraints, then of course, it will not be experientially uncolliding, but will instead all deal with the same physical constraints. Be it a building, or Mona Lisa painting, or a sunset from a outpost viewpoint, or whatever else it may be where the physical constraints are key to the experience.)

**Dynamic Response**:
- Colors shift with your state (This is Daiddaemonic ES specific; but it could very well be: Mode shifting. As it allows for the same information stream to be multiplexed and so much more versatile.)
- Phases adapt to daemon resonance (This is about will-coalescesing with others that be viewed as different Phases of experience. This is often quite useful, as to have some sort of aejective reality that is shared (Similar to Metroversal instead of Universal. But here it is aejective instead of objective; "mass psychosis by intent": To augment reality in a coherent manner with others to allow for aejective realities or phases))
- Patterns adapt to outcomes with a hyper focus on the daemon in question. Everything of these systems are pointed towards Man as the Ultimate End for the edge of - or the building blocks of - this entire system.
- Feedback improves predictions (However that feedback is conveyed)
- System "learns" your preferences (This is fundamentally about Aiddaemon being a good mirror of daemon; and aiddaemon able to leverage and intelligently guide such that the daiddaemon lives much better daemon than daemon alone.)
- Phase boundaries is will (I have given the example of a will being "I only want to experience a phase where everyone adores me and loves me as their God; which usually results in a phase where they are almost or entirely alone." or the worse version "I want a phase where everyone I encounter want me to abuse them violently and sexually in extremely desperate begging and pleading for me to do so" These sorts of wills will probably see themselves without any others to share their Phase with. Their aejective reality is entirely subjective)

### Trust Networks Amplify Coalescence

**Information Flow Benefits**:
- Learn what others actually want; Usually you don't; like... At all.. But your COALESCESE with others in very NEBULOUS and CROSS-INTENTIONAL ways that allows for Will-economic optimal paths concerning "everything the Aiddaemon has been able to learn about you and infer about the state of reality to predict what choices or steps in life might serve you the best"
- Discover compatible gatherings
- Share successful patterns
- Avoid known mismatches

**Network Effects**:
- Larger network = greater scale orchestration beyond trustless versions. 
- Diverse network = something-not-you options made more reliable (Note: "You are diverse" and "diversity" means that which "isn't your diversity"; since totally homogenous "copies of you in will network" would provide "every flavour of you options". But still, to be "thrown out and perturbed is nice. So Diversity.")
- Trusted network = safer exploration; much better predictions.
- Active network = more opportunities; strength of signals and real-time intelligence much better

### Practical Implementation

**Personal Level**:
```yaml
human_asked_for_k_will_profile:
  current_desires: [{BlobClassRef: 12883, ES: "DEEP_CONVERSATION"}, {BlobClassRef: 17283, ES: "CREATIVE_PROJECT"}, {BlobClassRef: 1273, ES: "EXERCISE_PARTNER"}]
  energy_state: { BlobClassRef: 293, ES: "EVENING_CONTEMPLATIVE" }
  openness: {BlobClassRef: 23, ES: "MEDIUM_HIGH"}
  constraints: [{BlobClassRef: 672, ES: "LOCAL_ONLY"}, { BlobClassRef: 48919, ES:  "QUIET_ENVIRONMENT" }]
```

**Facilitator System Redundancy Services in case of failure**:
- Event timing optimization
- Space energy management
- Group composition advice
- Activity suggestion
- Conflict prevention
(In general the building blocks are the intelligence substrate that enables or generates these emergences)

### The Economics of Connection

**Value Creation**:
- Successful coalescence creates value
- All participants benefit
- Positive-sum interactions
- No extraction needed in the sense of "third parties being needed and thus being justified in profitting of it"

**This is parasites trying to infiltrate what the system makes obsolete: Payment Models for will-manifestation infrastructure. This is utter garbage but will stay here as a reminder of how absolutely wrong and terribly misunderstood the following 3 points are**:
- Pay for introduction
- Subscribe to predictions
- Tip for successful connection
- Invest in community spaces

### Beyond Human Coalescence

**Will Exists at Every Scale**:
- Atoms "will" to bond
- Cells "will" to organize
- Ecosystems "will" to balance
- Planets "will" to orbit
- All can be understood as coalescence and will to disentangle. Like that of the massive meteor and earth.

### Critical Success Factors

**Privacy Protection**: Gossip can be anonymous; easily.
**Outcome Honesty**: Failed coalescence becomes evolutionarily deselected as will-economic topometers.
**Pattern Diversity**: Any types of connection supported
**Cultural Sensitivity**: Local patterns reveal will-economic costs when violating something others enjoy. 
**Individual Sovereignty**: Is free to always choose differently

### The Coalescent Future

When will coalescence reaches maturity:
- Every desire finds will-economic expression; it can mean simulated "others"; when it is highly mutually exclusive and unable to find will-coalescence.
- Loneliness becomes becomes navigational choice; with a few exceptions of those who are willed disentangled by everyone in the most extreme manner of The Crucible Triad exclusion from every zone other than Planetary (Devil's Mercy rules here).
- Creativity explodes with the assumption of actually being able to unleash and manifest one's creativity with "aligned" others; allows for moment to moment increase of creativity in relation to the old versions.
- Conflict that is insisted upon (where normal leverage dynamics can't dissuade towards will-disentanglement (Often due to categorical needs of some zero-sum reality (Like Jerusalem is any example of (Again, it is easy to do the AR time-sharing or will-coalescence in time to allow for sharing of the space; or even AR Phase Engine variety where one experiences different realities and the other denominations are muffled or grayed/blacked out)))) and able to occur in some Triad or virtual space: becomes domain of human creativity of how to solve it.
One suggested manner of bridging conflicts that can't be solved by the System; is to introduce "The Metagame of World Dynamics": The gamification of a conflict (A less than "Raw Might Display" game). Here one progressively by winning or losing, occupy or vacate more of the zero-sum resource. A winner-takes-all gamification is also possible, like the one in Troy, where the Spartans deal with another or some Celtic tribe, and instead of killing each other, they decide to gamify it: Their best man against the others' best man; Boagrius versus Achilles. Whereupon Aggammenon wins the celtic tribe as another legion of his, due to Achilles slaying Boagrius. This reduces the "destruction of total raw might display significantly"; and we already have proof of it working when rationalized why one should play within the rules of the game: Mutually Assured Destruction, Laws of War, WMDs at large and so on. You can do what you want, but the suggested Ubiquity Law is 123 MBC. And so the above scenario of Lethal combat is dissuaded or disencouraged.
Let's just put it this way: I would have like Boagrius to have lived and to have at least had the Ajax end at the Gates of Troy. Or better yet: A long and full life of conquest (conquest is systematized and made gradual first in terms of the system of the ability to leverage a ubiquity law like MBC into place. See also MIRA or Triads or NSS or whatever else or capitalism or ownership or whatever. But also the Raw Physical Might becomes not categorically excluded from conquest dynamics, and are instead included in this Metagame of World Dynamics where one gamifies what can't be solved otherwise. As a bridging from "opinion and consensus and law" towards Raw Might Display -- The many many steps to settle and lose by physical might or mind confrontation in games; without escalating and needing massive revenge due to loved ones dying or being hurt and so on. Also, it allows for economies and Triad loss and gain of territory to be structured around these games which collectively or in their totality/sum are names Metagame of World Dynamics (See roblockroblask or something banned X account.)); or whatever will he has, without the need to die.
- Humanity harmonizes (Which most fundamentally means: Becomes ordered in kind in space and time or at least in essential parts of actuality)

Not through forced unity but through discovered resonance. Unity is had, by other humans, becoming as unthreatening to what you will, as a puppy is. That is most simply will-disentangle from you by will-economic drives. When the other humans are not a sore in your eye, or at least not robbing you of the apple of your eye and ability to manifest your will somewhere, then: It becomes much easier to have unity, as the name of union wouldn't be a lying one covering one's total disempowerment and destruction (Like modern nation states or EU and so on mostly does towards its inhabitants).
Not through categorization but through pattern recognition that allows for human will to manifest and the consequence side-effects of it. Not through control but through facilitation.

The infrastructure exists to serve this: computation finds patterns, electricity powers gatherings, water sustains bodies, food fuels connection, shelter for local climate allows for space utilization and "new beginnings" or "founding of Durotar".
(There you have the primary motivation for the authoring of these documents. To bring about a memetic change by real alternative to world organization: That allows for going free and beginning again anew and according to one's own will without that which ruins any inkling of trying to manifest it).
All utilities ultimately serve the meta-utility of will coalescence.
Which again is incentivized to facilitate the subsistance or attractiveness of for others, due to it becoming more will-economic to will-disentangle.

This is why we build - not for technology itself but for what it enables. Every technical system, every trust network, every discovered pattern serves the ultimate purpose: helping conscious beings find each other for will-amplification in manifestational capacity and especially to avoid all those which thwart it or ruin it: Will-disentanglement. And to create together what we really dream of in the brief time we share.

### The Infinite Game

Will coalescence is never "solved" because, but it will be solved:
- People change continuously
- Desires evolve endlessly
- Patterns shift constantly
- Mystery remains always
- Discovery continues forever
It is however solved, because at some state of the new world order, these changes are instantly appeasable or approachable. There isn't a gray sky or wall between a path towards what you want (for almost anyone... Again, if NOBODY wants you, then you're alone and then it is you and the universe in your own empty Triad lot by the Mercy of The Devil (My initial suggested setting is hackney zoning of desert lands with good water supply for Devil's Mercy land. Alternatively Islands or Arctic climate islands or places). But of course, this too can change over time.).

The system succeeds not by eliminating the unknown but by making exploration safer, richer, and more likely to satisfy the deep will that moves through all things - the will to connect, create, and become.

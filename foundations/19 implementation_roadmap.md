# 19. Implementation Roadmap

## Phases of System Emergence

### Phase 0: Foundation Building (Months 0-12)

**Technical Development**:
- Core Discovery OS protocols
- Basic trust network mapping and infrastructure of information and Persons (PoPs)
- Proof of Person mechanisms
- Initial blob class with human-comprehension/intuition implementations (Perhaps inspiration from Kenneth Stanley work)
- Aiddaemon attempts. From computewarehouses to self-hosted jail-broken phones, home-computers with secure connection and stable connectivity; or self-manufactured hardware.
- AR Phase Engine foundation and opening up development of particular LLL experiences; incorporating the previous parts and flows of information and control.

**Community Seeding**:
- Early adopter recruitment
- Developer ecosystem; especially for LLL games. The Aiddaemon development will not be very decentralized, but rather go along Trust Network lines ( which initially is highly correlated with states; or in high-trust societies many will not trust much other than the state; without knowing who they're actually trusting: PoP will make that visible and hopefully sufficient demand for high degree of chain of production and service all PoP included and machinery etc. ) But LLL Games, that Augmentated or interface to the system "gaming" experience, will quite accessible to be entirely decentralized, down to the highschool student making his/her own version etc.
- Initial trust network stability. Information is realiable and of scale to be extremely useful. 
- Use case identification
- Documentation completion

**Proof of Concepts**:
- Small-scale computational discovery
- Local food/water trust networks (in terms of pollutants, poison and externalities. "What consequence, in as much scope as possible, does this or that act have. (concerning food and water initially is perhaps reasonable start). What about viewed from this perspective, how do the acts relate in consequence? Let's say endocrine disrupters or animal murder or suffering?")
- Prototype AR applications
- Basic will coalescence experiments; Real-time update of human choices when navigatable terrain of interaction space and "poor aiddaemonic understanding of them" -- Still: It will be massive upgrade in relation to now. Take the example of "I want to party tonight" (Instant possibility of ways to advertise it and discover in subjective depth where to go or coalescese) or say "I want to go from A to B today" and the consequent coalescence (I.e. despite really poor aiddaemons the actualization layer with PoP and Trust Network (coarse and imperfect) still provide a real market-place of will-manifestation to emerge - though initially in very verbose and explicit format and with bad accuracy and realization rate).

### Phase 1: Local Experiments (Year 1-2)

**Geographic Clusters**:
- Silicon Valley tech communities
- Rural agricultural networks
- Artist colonies
- University towns
- Island communities

**Utility Implementations**:
- **CohesionNet**: Amateur radio mesh networks
- **Health Pathways**: Much more holistic understanding of person state (not shallow diagnosis; but everything about their psychology and somatic that is divulged to ones Aiddaemon and from it wanted shared; Including real circumstances of what is realizable for the person in their environment and alternative environments to choose from) providing healing in a much more robust and fundamental way. Instead of symptom treatment, healing moves towards "any domain of perturbation and all at once" fundamental movements and from that fundamental health change and with that bodily ability to heal or move towards blueprint design of its organism. (Including things like medicine of course... Or hospitals... But no authoritative assertion of hundred million being states as "one state: word (diabetes-2)" and "treatment with". But instead... The previous.)
- **Energy Trading**: Solar neighborhood grids
- **Food Trust**: Farmer's market networks

**Trust Network Growth**:
- 1,000,000+ verified persons, all able to flow information but with different mapping of trust, and much of it inferred from Trust Network effects (Trust of Trust which makes Trust Transitive. Trustworthyness)
- Cross-cluster connections forming; beacons of extreme keen discrimination of information that allows for information to flow between these high-effort filters to ensure trustworthiness. 
- Reputation patterns emerging; Persons using the system begin to monetarily at least avoid very large selections of persons who are fundamentally against some explicit concerns of theirs. Including being untrustworthy, tricking, deceiving and ripping others bare and into ruin for any slight gain to themselves or theirs'.
- Bad actor identification working

### Phase 2: Network Effects (Year 2-4)

**Scaling Dynamics**:
- Regional trust network mergers
- Inter-utility connections
- Cross-domain blob classes
- Non-private but cultural Language evolution beginning; Language diverging new names for language groups become reasonable. (I.e. 100 new english-derivatives. Like Germanic-branch languages english is of, but then english-branch languages of which many new will be of. And so on.)

**Market Formation**:
- Will-based professional rankings
- Utility token economics; perhaps in relation to "control access of machine or utility substrates".
- Late High-leverage actor participation
- Gatekeeper disruption starting; Many Old power structures failing to command, control and constrain the many.

**Crucible Experiments**:
- First physical sovereignty zones (This can be done BEFORE any system implementation and will be a human-application of lessons; It could be done TODAY. It could be done by decree, by law or by Horns simply saying: "This is new state of ours. We are free. We are Sovereign. We are Legion. Try and fail. Deal with it. We are not your slaves or subjects.")
- Special economic zone partnerships
- Seastead communities
- Desert experiments 

### Phase 3: Critical Mass (Year 4-7)

**Mainstream Adoption**:
- 100M+ active users
- Major utility disruptions
- Regulatory confrontations
- Traditional system responses
- Many previous nation states have balkanized into New and Old World. Or whatever they want to call it from another perspective: "Dangerous New Revolutionary World versus Free Democratic World" would probably be the framing? But, I mean...

**Infrastructure Maturity**:
- Global computational mesh
- Ubiquitous AR adoption; The massive empowerment of our senses (all parts to our sensory experience being presented with highly subjectively encoded intuitive information to help us navigate) and communication bandwidth and manifestation power.
- Mature trust networks
- Some persons will have developed rich neologized vocabulary to further increase communication bandwidth and to think more clearly. Clear language clear thoughts clear cuts. Clarity. (Emil O.W. Kierkegaard motto or mantra)

**Civilizational Divergence**:
- Clear trust network separations; Trust Atlas set-differences.
- Massive amounts of sovereignty options; Though most of it is nested under some military geopolitical ordering. Ocean or World Level. Some under only Sea Level Military Orders (Though it becomes much harder to guarantee safety without higher order nesting and only lateral acts). Some might even try lake, river and spring level. But again usually they do this in the indirect safety of others. Perhaps a tiny minority is able to act at those levels and be a geopolitical force that can't simply be conquered, but put up a real fight, but it isn't expected: Most will have to face reality of nesting under the Horns they prefer and Sovereign/Halo tradeoffs.
- Mass movement of persons and migration beginning: Pioneering of new worlds. Perhaps coming together in the old. Don't expect easy solving of the great metropolises of the world in terms against chaos and entropy. It is "hard" to "deport sufficient for daemonic proximity of choice". But perhaps everyone will find reason in borders between "those that you deem dangerous" and "those you do not". Or, "those that those I trust have gathered information about being dangerous". The Old World too, to remove and border themselves away from those they deem dangerous: To reduce killing, extreme violence and rape to 0 or close to it. Merely by willingness to prejudicially judge others sufficient for being on another side of a line called a border which prevents movements. "Somewhere Free. But not here. On the other side of this border line. Here you can live freely. And you can make borders between you inbetween if you want. But WE WILL protect our own and innocents from the small selection of persons who conceivably end up doing these things". You don't need to partition your country in state control. You merely need to make it "zoned" or not open movements between "nice person world" and "that group of persons that end up doing the bad and evil things". And if you do that: crime to zero. Or almost. In the "nice person" border-zone. Whereas in the other zone. It will be further segmentation on any self-identification, themselves with help to control border, but grand lesson for them all and us all. To see, what "the prison colony" makes of itself. "Australia. 2.0". There is a rehabilitating effect of seeing the truth of their behaviour when high density. (They disagree others are like them? Segment. Fractally. Again and again. Until they are only with those they believe like themselves. Then at least then they will not be able to avoid knowing something about the truth to their effect and way of being)
- Value system clarification

### Phase 4: New World Emergence (Year 7-15)

**Parallel Systems**:
- Old world persists but shrinks
- Crucible world expanding
- Clear advantages visible
- Natural selection operating

**Full Feature Deployment**:
- All utilities acts through WM actualization layer that sees all acts go through PoP knowledge and trust-network foundation.
- AR phase separation normal
- Sovereignty choosing common
- Will manifestation infrastructure complete

**Transformation Complete**:
- Billions using system
- Tens of Thousands of 100+ person experiments
- Human potential finding soil to express itself in 
- New equilibrium reached

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Technical Requirements

**Foundational** (Must have first):
- Ownership and Pwnership coherence.
- Cryptographic identity systems PoP pseudonymity tying OPwnership of any machinery
- Distributed computation protocols
- Basic AR hardware
- Trust Transitivity integrity ensurance/feedback/dynamics/responsiveness and Trust Map inference algorithms

**Enhancement** (Improves adoption):
- Advanced blob class learning
- Seamless AR interfaces
- Efficient routing protocols
- Natural language processing
- LLL Games profitability. Strata PoP-Witness PoU-Witness Trust Network flow internal game-mechanic tokenization using-systems-for-Will-manifestation-positive-sum-stake-strata (Any will-manifestation will have 'some' utility holistically in positive-sum ability to facilitate or actualize or pathfind will-manifestation. But many types also include things like being a street muscisian and getting strata-appreciation positive-sum payment that is fluid and gradient on Aiddaemonic resonance and broadcasting in "utility provided for daemon" which causes positive-sum-strata. Of course, giving-beyond-that-effect-with-its-risk-aversion-err-biasing, is a very human-to-human appreciation display. So direct transfer/donation/giving-of-coins will remain even if system is perfect).

**Optimization** (Maximizes potential):
- Quantum-resistant security; No system is secure. You can do quantum security. But you can't do general security. It isn't possible. Because universe can compute it. So, it can be utilized. Exotic Computing Devices. Quantum Computing is simply one very powerful speed-up in some domains of computation. But it can be had in any problem of our universe.
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Full sensory AR
- Predictive will modeling

### Social Requirements

**Trust Bootstrap**:
- Initial high-trust communities or "outstanding characters" gaining Trust-Traction from many. They want their Trust of Trust Trustworthiness Transitvity inference utility. (You can imagine "the benevolent intelligence service of a nation state going full acountability mode and public view for others to subscribe Trust Transitivity to within the PoP etc system")
- Compelling early use cases and try-the-experience access (What it enables..).
- Visible success stories
- Network effect initiation

**Cultural Shifts**:
- Exit rights normalization and "general acceptance of being excluded / no wanted". Like, "It is totally fine, in fact good, that others dare to refuse my company or participation if they don't want it."
- Reputation consequence acceptance
- Intolerance and separation. Segregation and apartness becoming a treasured aspect to having expression be full and complete, unhindered and authentic.
- Will expression comfort
- Diversity appreciation; Distinctiveness amongst even the familiar becoming treasured and cherished for their love of maximizing/optimizing distinctiveness and distance. (The Dreaded Purity Spiraling -- Only a problem for dominating structure. Not with plurality focus and making space for expressiveness of distinctiveness. Love of Diversity. Love of all things distance. (Esoteric Evola Expressions :P))

**Economic Transitions**:
- Alternative value recognition; "Height expert system for mate finding"; But then for "What is valuable expert system of monetized market prize". Same human psychological fault patched and empowered the intent of: "I care about what matters to others more than what I myself honestly would decide mattered to me".
- Gatekeeper abandonment (Like a dam trying to hold back the river; only to discover itself unable to anymore; to find itself a tower surrounded by a flowing river. Then finally collapse as the bricks of its foundation are washed away.)
- Direct exchange adoption
- Trust currency acceptance: Market price isn't accounting for full-externality and the ups and downs of the costs hidden in the purchase of a product; but incurred morally, societally and globally. And in its full transition: full will-economic perspective on transactions where money-token isn't necessary. But still a human-perspective nicety and psychological postive-sum effect of interacting in the world. As simple and easy to parse improvement metric: 1D number goes up or down. (Understand, the only real utility of money is indebtedness book-keeping that allows for future "universal command" (everyone mercenarily interacting). But in the presence of "perfect" or "pretty good" will-manifestation with PoP etc layers. Then this book-keeping of indebtedness becomes as multi-dimensional and contextual and accounting for degree of will-manifestation in a much much much deeper and better way. Such that, the idea that money represents "wealth created, goods and services provided to demanders in their rational agency and wanting of the service that you then FULLY PROVIDED in their intent" becomes realized but not in a 1d metric system. Again. Maturation. At some point. Initially, we get dilemma of monetary but also externalities and costs or will-alignment in money flow and so on. As well as easier way to have it happen without money: Often when positive-sum is so large for all participants/interactors that they coalescese happily without monetary incentive. They don't need the money-lubrication to collide and manifest together.)

### Regulatory Navigation

**Parallel Building**:
- Avoid direct confrontation initially
- Build alternatives, don't fight; If no way out, then decide if it is worth to buy land under Old World Triads and their potential domination, taking of all you own and punishing to varying degrees you and yours. If it seems too risky, seek somewhere else on the planet where it is less risky. Then purchase land there and build systems internally facing within compliance of embedded Triad of Old World System/State. Or consider waiting for a breaking point of some state somewhere that allows for a shard implementation of your Triad. Similarly, for NSS and similar systems: Build. It is superior. And we need plurality of systems for Trust reasons. Human Constraints.
- Demonstrate superior outcomes
- Let adoption create pressure

**Strategic Territories**:
- Failed states welcoming innovation
- International waters (This is legitimate a High-leverage actor possibility: Massive floating or platformed cities/islands that implement Crucible underneath Actor Triad open for nesting he/she agrees with. Initial Pirate version of it. But again: Horn and the reality of it. So, be careful not to be too "offensive" or "justifying violence against you" or conquest)
- Special economic zones
- Crypto-friendly jurisdictions (Liberland and similar places could implement Crucible system internally as an example: So free as to allow domination and supression of freeness -- In A Dominum among the many many dominae. The territorial expanse of the concept of "a house" by "rallying" or other dynamics. Such as economic conquest or whatever else. You make the Triad rules that nests below function in.)

**Natural Obsolescence**:
- Regulations are also obstacles for "that which work" to be allowed to actualize; Like all law, it prevents on either end of spectrum. Convergence at the edges. But eventually they will become MASSIVE and OVERWHELMINGLY UNACCEPTABLE obstacles for "doing what works or is good" (Any(?) Law as well (Consider MBC and random extreme hypothetical but plausible scenarios (I regret saying it. Because of the effect on "Well is this now the exception state?" then instantly being open for the many or any place in the spectrum and then up for their own judgement of whether it is or not. Law is great when facing "downwards" as invioable rules towards those for whom we would wish to make the law against or those who might otherwise end up doing it.))).
- Enforcement works in abstraction and actuality without physical enforcement in almost all cases: Beliefs of consequence of act trade-off.
- Public opinion shifts to adaption of systems and new ways of "having things happen and in orderly fashion" etc.
- Political adaptation follows, or if it doesn't stubborn holding onto or clinging to power as the world leaves them behind.

## Implementation Strategies

### Start Where There's Pain

**High-Value Early Targets**:
- Medical refugees seeking healing; This is again a "High-leverage Actor" opportunity. Function as actualizational layer, in terms of match-making/headhunting and funding the original "Hospitals and Hospitaleers" sparsely around the world; or medical ships or other logistics, that moves high-end expensive equipment around the world to provide for treatment of persons. "A sort of daemonic overlap and community in that calling; at the very least will-coalescence concerning it". Alternatively, funding of such a thing: A "city of healing", where the sick are flown to, and where persons live there not for pay and universal command (money), but because the life there is fulfilling and meaningful and eudaimonic and full of persons they truly enjoy spending their lives with and doing both recreational and professional work with. The scalable and cheap financing of getting things done.
- Creators escaping gatekeepers
- Communities wanting autonomy
- Innovators hitting regulatory walls

**Clear Value Propositions**:
- "Find healing outside the system"
- "Sell directly to your true fans"
- "Build the community you want"
- "Create without permission"

### Network Effect Acceleration

**Metcalfe's Law Application**:
- Each new user adds value for all
- Focus on dense local networks first
- Bridge high-value clusters
- Create discovery mechanisms

**Viral Mechanics**:
- Success stories spread naturally
- Trust networks share discoveries
- Will coalescence creates belonging
- Exit from old system proves possible

### Resource Requirements

**Initial Funding** ($10-50M):
- Core protocol development
- Initial community building
- Proof of concept projects
- Documentation and education

**Growth Capital** ($100M-1B):
- Infrastructure deployment
- Market formation support
- Sovereignty experiments
- Regulatory navigation

**Self-Sustaining** (Year 5+):
- Transaction fees fund development
- Successful zones support system
- High-leverage actors contribute
- Network value creates resources

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Single Points of Failure**:
- Distributed architecture
- Multiple implementations
- Open source foundations
- Community ownership

**Scalability Challenges**:
- Layer 2 solutions ready
- Efficient routing protocols
- Local-first architecture
- Progressive decentralization

### Social Risks

**Bad Actor Infiltration**:
- Trust consequences compound
- Network naturally excludes
- Exit rights prevent capture
- Transparency reveals truth

**Cultural Resistance**:
- Start with receptive communities
- Demonstrate clear benefits
- Allow voluntary adoption
- Respect those who don't join

### Regulatory Risks

**Government Crackdowns**:
- Distributed resilience
- Multiple jurisdictions
- Encrypted foundations
- Popular support defense

**Corporate Resistance**:
- Superior user experience
- Direct value creation
- Network effect power
- Inevitable obsolescence

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative

**Adoption Metrics**:
- Active users with PoP
- Trust network connections
- Utility confirmations daily
- Sovereignty experiments active

**Value Metrics**:
- Gatekeeper market share loss
- Direct exchange volume
- Trust Networked indebtedness metrics (which could be 1d initially; again stepping stones towards WE topologies that can replace money if it is willed) The money that has meaning becoming currency in increasing circulation (The Money Means "Has provided willed, intented and so fulfilled goods and services for persons (within friend-distinction?)" (Note ownership is often in the way. What ))
- Will coalescence success rate

### Qualitative

**Life Improvement**:
- Healing outside medical and especially medicament system
- Creating without gatekeepers
- Finding resonant community
- Living chosen values

**System Health**:
- Diverse experiments thriving
- Natural selection visible
- Language evolving rapidly
- Exit rights exercised freely

## The Path Forward

**Month 1-6**: Decentralized attempts at Core team assembly, initial funding, protocol development
**Month 6-12**: First communities, basic features, trust network seed
**Year 2**: Local success stories, utility proof, network growth
**Year 3**: Regional expansion, market formation, sovereignty tests
**Year 5**: Critical mass approached, old system disruption, new world visible
**Year 10**: Parallel worlds established, natural selection operating, humanity transforming

And it could all unfold in a few years. Or in a hundred years. Who knows.

The roadmap is not rigid but adaptive. Each phase learns from the previous, adjusting based on what works. The only constant is the vision: infrastructure for will manifestation, trust replacing force, discovery replacing prescription, and humanity's full diversity finally able to express itself.

Success comes not from perfect execution but from unleashing human creativity within trust networks. Build the foundation, demonstrate the value, and let humanity manifest its will.

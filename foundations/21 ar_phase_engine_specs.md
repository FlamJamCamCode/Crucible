# 21. AR Phase Engine Specifications

## Core Architecture

### Dual-Function Design

In general The Augmented Reality mode can be viewed as a gamification of your local life lived: LLL games. Making embellishments or metrics or interaction space (phases) and so on to create a setting in which you "play according to your will in some visualized landscape and points of interaction".
**Function 1: Will Navigation Display**
- Visual overlays showing probability paths
- Real-time will coalescence indicators
- Future potential visualization
- Choice consequence previews
- Any subspace of will that is entered and enjoyed. Like that of a particular social setting or participating in a game and so on.

**Function 2: Phase Reality Separation**
- Multiple hyperrealities in same space
- Incompatible experiences segregated
- Selective presence/absence
- Reality modulation per daemon

### Technical Stack

**Hardware Layer**:
Whatever you want. Your machinery running or Trust degree of others' machinery running or computing on data from or to.
- AR glasses/contacts (visual-output)
- Haptic wear (touch)
- Recording or proprioception of body, face/mimics and eyes (visual-input)
- Biometrics of any sort; including sweat, goosebumps, blood-levels/markers and so on.
- EEG brain scanners
- Spatial & selective audio (sound)
- Scent synthesizers (smell)
- Neural interfaces (future)

- Local data into blob class processing
- Edge computing nodes
- Distributed rendering
- Privacy-preserving protocols

**Network Layer**:

- Encrypted phase channels
- Cross-phase protocols

**Experience Layer**:
- Reality synthesis engine

## Navigation Display Specifications

### Color Saturation System
Totally variant per person (Daiddaemonic Encoding Schemes). But sometimes an LLL game insist on Phase shared truths: aejectivity.
**Primary Channels**:
- **Red**: Romantic/intimate potential (240-780 THz)
- **Green**: Economic/prosperity paths (520-610 THz)
- **Blue**: Learning/growth opportunities (610-670 THz)
- **Purple**: Healing/wellness directions (380-450 THz)
- **Gold**: Creative collaboration (570-590 THz)
- **Silver**: Spiritual/meaning paths (metallic overlay)

**Saturation Encoding**:
- 0-20%: Low probability/weak resonance
- 20-50%: Moderate potential
- 50-80%: Strong alignment likely
- 80-100%: Extremely high compatibility
- Glowing: You should really try to approach the person
- Radiance lighting up the setting: That's the one. You really need to go and try.

**Temporal Modulation**:
- Steady: Stable opportunity
- Pulsing: Time-sensitive
- Flickering: Unstable/changing
- Flowing: Dynamic/moving

### Probability Visualization

**Particle Effects**:
- Density indicates certainty
- Movement shows flow direction
- Color matches opportunity type
- Size represents magnitude

**Path Rendering**:
- Solid lines: High confidence routes
- Dashed: Moderate confidence
- Dotted: Low confidence
- Glowing: Personally significant

**Intersection Highlighting**:
- Convergence points glow brighter
- Multiple path overlaps emphasized
- Choice nodes clearly marked
- Consequence branches visible

## Phase Separation Specifications

### Phase Definition

- Physics modifications

**Phase Types**:

- **Group**: Shared daemon space
- **Public**: Consensus reality
- **Transition**: Boundary zones
- **Emergency**: Override all

### Reality Modulation

- Color transformation
- Object substitution
- Person appearance shifting
- Environmental redesign

**Audio Modulation**:

**Olfactory Modulation**:
- Scent synthesis
- Smell cancellation
- Aroma substitution
- Pheromone enhancement
- Memory triggering

### Phase Boundary Management
An idea of how an LLL game could want to deal with phases. But they can exist totally individual all the way to strictly enforced by the game. Like normal software or games now.
**Hard Boundaries**:
- Complete segregation
- No cross-phase awareness
- Separate interaction spaces
- Independent physics

**Soft Boundaries**:
- Partial awareness allowed
- Filtered interaction possible
- Graduated transitions
- Consensual crossing

However, all should deal with fundamental Triad rule/protocols, which we hope Planetary (due to MBC entails) would be that they all switch to emergency-solving/coordination-game upon emergencies.
**Emergency Overrides**:
- Emergency punch-through
- Disaster warnings break-through 
- Safety alerts cross-phase
- Massive coordination of all persons simultaneously, to for a moment be guided to do and act (with Aiddaemonic disclosure to Trust Network bridging to "authority" or emergency dealing actors) such that the emergency is dealt with in the most resourceful way - including all persons available there or not. But for many it would simply mean navigating them "out of the way": Per person "optimal"/coordinated "Exit paths" visible.

## Interaction Protocols

### Cross-Phase Communication
LLL intra- and inter-game cross-phase virtual-info-flow.
Could have some made in the following ways. Though probably not.
**Permission Systems**:
- Explicit consent required
- Trust score thresholds
- Context-sensitive rules
- Revocable access

**Translation Layers**:
- Aesthetic compatibility matching
- Semantic bridging
- Cultural interpretation
- Emotional mapping

**Buffering Zones**:
- Neutral meeting spaces
- Temporary phase alignment
- Mediated interaction
- Safe exploration

### Object Persistence

**Physical Object Handling**:
- Real objects remain tangible
- Virtual overlays per phase
- Collision detection maintained
- Safety boundaries enforced

**Virtual Object Rules**:
- Phase-specific existence
- Ownership tracking
- Interaction permissions
- Persistence options

**Hybrid Objects**:

- Whatever audio not conducive to the experience can be muffled or filtered out. (Emergency also exists like a car approaching you with collision... Or you talking in traffic and being able to hear the vehicles or fast moving objects (Including those that otherwise wouldn't make a sound - and travelling faster than speed of sound))

**Haptic Channels**:
- Pressure (0.1-100 N/cm²)
- Temperature (10-45°C safe range)

- Texture simulation
- Electrical stimulation

**Olfactory Synthesis**:
- 500+ base scents
- Real-time mixing

- Memory association

**Gustatory Enhancement**:
- Basic taste modulation (Turn sour into sweet fruit and things like that)
- Flavor complexity adding
- Temperature sensation
- Texture simulation
- Appetite modification

### Neural Interface Specs (Future)
Bad AI suggestion:
**Direct Neural Modulation**:
- Sensory bypass capabilities; Because that will totally not be dystopian.
- Emotion induction/suppression; Because that isn't robotization of humanity. The moral instinct or compass altered. (I get it you already do this: Psychopharmika. Leave me out of it. I am Master. The world I change to suit me. Not other way around. Not machine forcing me how to feel. Or others.)
- Memory enhancement; Okay.
- Consciousness expansion

**Safety Protocols**:
- Hard limits encoded
- Failsafe disconnection
- Medical monitoring
- Consent verification
- Recovery procedures

## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection

**Local Processing First**:

## Performance Specifications

### Latency Requirements
With NSS and CohesionNet (and new personal devices) then latency in LLL Games go to nanoseconds or microseconds at most. To talk in ms will be silly at that point.
**Visual**: <16ms photon-to-photon
**Audio**: <10ms processing delay
**Haptic**: <5ms touch response
**Position**: <20ms tracking update
**Network**: <50ms phase sync

### Computational Requirements
Probably new personal devices and local-game-enablers / phase-switching.
**Minimum Specs**:
- Depends on the game. Probably nothing else than personal devices. Perhaps some game-enabling compute units nearby.

**Recommended Specs**:
- 50 TFLOPS local compute
- Sub-millimeter tracking
- 240Hz refresh rate

### Power Management

**Passive Mode**: Low power drain

## Implementation Considerations

- Audio-only mode available
- Text notifications fallback

**Progressive Enhancement**:
- Basic features first

- Graceful degradation

### Standards Compliance

**Open Protocols**:

**Safety Standards**:
- Photosensitive seizure prevention

- Ergonomic guidelines

### Philosophical Extensions

**Reality Authorship**:
- Personal physics engines
- Custom natural laws
- Time flow control
- Dimension creation

The AR Phase Engine represents not just augmentation but transformation - from single consensus reality to infinite personal realities, from forced proximity to chosen presence, from one truth to many truths coexisting. It is the technical infrastructure for humanity's next phase of being.

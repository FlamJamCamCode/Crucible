# Neologistic Reality Cutting: The Sword of Semantic Precision

TODO: - It occupies 'a share of the industry' for a few hands without any ability for others to compete. It all goes through proxies and bureaucracy to then occupy a position. This isn't only employment, but more generally 'Expert Systems' and Categorical thinking: "This person solves and is responsible for [category]. Everyone else is not and totally disbarred". It cuts the possibility of acts in the real world into very limited and long processes by historical data or proxies like education/schooling/degrees to select what is allowed to happen in terms of acts. It is useful when you have to be able to justify any failure and remove responsibility from yourself. But it is very poor in steering a ship and dealing with reality. "What lunacy to hire a person falling between or outside [categories] that is [type] for that [function]". That causes it all to be stupid and brittle. Any attempt at using more information than the projective space of being [category] or [type] for the [function] results in being called not only irresponsible but also stupid and evil!

## The Fundamental Problem

Human language evolved for rough communication, not precise reality control. We're trapped using words that cut reality in ways that don't serve us - inherited categories that carry baggage, lack precision, and force us into prepositional explosions.

## The Prepositional Disease

```forth
\ The multiplication of unnecessary variants:
drawWindowWithBorder()
drawWindowWithoutBorder()
drawWindowWithShadow()
drawWindowWithBorderAndShadow()
\ ... thousands of combinations

\ Versus clean predicate composition:
: window ( x y w h -- ) ;
: bordered ( xt -- xt' ) ;
: shadowed ( xt -- xt' ) ;
\ Infinite combinations from few predicates
```

## Blob Classes as Discovery Tools

Blob classes aren't storage - they're the bridge between computational representation and reality patterns. They help us discover where to cut.

```forth
: discover-functional-cuts ( -- )
    \ Train on what YOU actually care about
    your-will-economic-data train-model
    
    \ Blob classes emerge at natural joints
    cluster-#2847: [morning-anxiety + email-weight + vitamin-D-lack]
    
    \ Name the discovered pattern
    : ÈáçÁÆ±Èúß ( -- ) ;  \ "heavy-box-fog" 
    
    \ Now you can address THIS specific state
    \ Not through clumsy combinations
;
```

## The Science of Cutting (Skei)

Science = Skei (PIE: to cut, slice, divide)

The Aiddaemon gives each human a personal sword to cut reality along lines that matter to THEM:

```forth
\ Not universal cuts:
: happiness ( -- ) ;  \ Too vague, means different things

\ But personal cuts:
: Èùô ( -- )  \ YOUR specific calm-environment pattern
             \ Cuts reality where YOUR will-economics shifts
             \ Discovered through YOUR interactions
;
```

## Logarithmic Language Collapse

Through proper abstraction and discovered neologisms:

```forth
\ Traditional: 100MB binary
\ Forth predicates: 10KB
\ Neologisms: 100 bytes

: Êô®Ëª¢ ( -- )  \ One symbol captures entire morning-transition pattern
: ‰ΩìÊòé ( -- )  \ Post-exercise clarity state  
: ÊµÅÊ∑± ( -- )  \ Deep work flow state

\ Each word compresses millions of training examples
\ Into single executable symbol
```

## Why Unicode Matters

With full Unicode (Sanskrit, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Chinese, invented symbols):

```forth
: ìÇÄìèèìäñ ( x y w h -- )  \ Egyptian: "eye-create-space"
: ‡•ê‡•çìÇÄÈùô ( -- )  \ Mixed script: perfect semantic density
: üúçüù∞üúÅ ( -- )  \ Alchemical symbols for transformations

\ Every symbol can carry maximum semantic weight
\ No wasted ASCII limitations
```

## The Projection Problem

These words are projections, not complete captures:

```forth
\ Reality: ‚àû-dimensional experience
\ Word: Useful projection onto learnable dimensions

: Èùô ( -- )
    \ Captures: environment, timing, intensity
    \ Misses: relationship states, creative energy
    \ But STABLE and USEFUL projection
;

\ Through use, you learn the projection's shape
\ When it "lights up" and when it doesn't
```

## Building Your Semantic Castle

```forth
\ Level 1: Broad realms
: ÂøÉ ( -- ) emotional-realm ;
: ‰Ωì ( -- ) physical-realm ;
: Êô∫ ( -- ) cognitive-realm ;

\ Level 2: Refined cuts
: ÂøÉÈùô ( -- ) emotional-calm ;
: ‰ΩìÂäõ ( -- ) physical-energy ;

\ Level 3: Precise states
: ÂøÉÈùôÊúù ( -- ) morning-specific-calm ;

\ Each level cuts finer
\ Along YOUR functional needs
```

## Integration with Discovery OS

The neologisms become immutable once discovered:

```forth
: crystallize-discovery ( pattern -- )
    optimal-neologism generate
    test-predictive-power
    test-control-power
    
    powerful? IF
        immutable-vocabulary add
        \ No versioning needed
        \ This IS the perfect cut
    THEN ;
```

## The Result

Each human develops a personal vocabulary of reality-cutting words:
- Discovered through blob classes
- Validated through use
- Optimized for their will-economics
- Compressed to theoretical minimum
- Executable as reality-shaping spells

The Aiddaemon doesn't just understand commands - it helps forge a language of precision where each word cuts reality exactly where the human needs control.

This is the Sword made real: not metaphorical categorization but actual reality-cutting through discovered semantic precision.
